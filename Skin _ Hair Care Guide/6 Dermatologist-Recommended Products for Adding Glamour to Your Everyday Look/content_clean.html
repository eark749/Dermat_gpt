<p>First on the list is a high-quality moisturiser. Moisturising your skin not only helps to keep it hydrated and healthy, but it also provides a smooth base for applying makeup. Our dermatologist recommends trying the <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hydrasoothe-moisturiser">Clinikally HydraSoothe Moisturiser</a>, which is packed with <span>unique DMS (Derma Membrane Structure) technology</span> and has a non-greasy formula that won't clog your pores.</p>

<p>Next, consider incorporating a vitamin C serum into your skincare routine. Vitamin C is known for its ability to brighten the skin and give it a radiant glow. The<a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-vitamin-c3-serum"> Clinikally Vitamin C3+ serum</a> is a favourite among dermatologists and is designed to improve the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and uneven skin tone.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Highlighting Cream</strong></h3>

<p>If you want to add a little extra sparkle to your look, try using a highlighting cream.
