<br/>
<p><span>Here is the detailed explanation of the above table: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Method of Exfoliation</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Body Scrubs</strong><span><strong>:</strong> These are physical exfoliants that use a gritty substance, such as sugar, salt, or coffee grounds, mixed with oils or gels. When you massage a body scrub into your skin, the rough texture of the particles helps to physically remove dead skin cells.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exfoliation</strong><strong>:</strong> Chemical exfoliation uses acids or enzymes to dissolve and remove dead skin cells without physical scrubbing.</p>
<strong>2. Ingredients:</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Body Scrubs</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Typically contain natural or synthetic exfoliating particles like sugar, salt, crushed nut shells, or microbeads, combined with moisturising agents.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exfoliation:</strong><span> Chemical exfoliants often contain ingredients like alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs), beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs), or enzymes. <br/><br/><strong>3. Skin Sensitivity:</strong><br/></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span></span></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Body Scrubs</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Can be harsh on sensitive skin, as the physical scrubbing action can cause irritation or micro-tears in the skin if used too vigorously.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exfoliation</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Chemical exfoliants can be gentler on sensitive skin, as they remove dead skin cells without the need for physical rubbing. However, they can also cause irritation if the concentration of acids is too high or if the skin is particularly sensitive. <br/><br/></span><strong>4. Application Frequency:</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Body Scrubs</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Generally recommended for use once or twice a week to avoid over-exfoliation and skin irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exfoliation</strong><span><strong>:</strong> The frequency of chemical exfoliation can vary based on the type of product and skin sensitivity. Some gentle exfoliants can be used daily, while stronger ones might be used less frequently.<br/><br/></span><strong>5. Effectiveness:</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Body Scrubs</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Effective for immediate removal of surface-level dead skin and for stimulating blood flow to the skin's surface.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exfoliation</strong><span>: Chemical exfoliants can be more effective for deeper exfoliation, helping to unclog pores, and improve skin texture and tone over time.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>In summary, while both body scrubs and exfoliation serve to remove dead skin cells, their methods, ingredients, and effects on the skin can vary significantly. Choosing between them depends on your skin type, sensitivity, and desired results.</span></p>

<h2><b>Understanding Skin Exfoliation<br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="Understanding Skin Exfoliation" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_4_-_2024-01-04T111701.287_480x480.png?v=1704347263"/></div>
<p><span>Exfoliation is a skincare technique aimed at removing dead skin cells from the skin's outermost layer. While it can enhance skin appearance by promoting a more radiant and smooth complexion, it is of utmost importance to approach exfoliation with caution. Improper techniques or over-exfoliation can lead to skin damage, increased redness, or acne breakouts, particularly for those with sensitive skin.</span></p>
<h4><b>Understanding Skin Types and Exfoliation Needs:</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Sensitive Skin</b><span>: Prone to stinging or burning sensations post-exfoliation. Such skin requires gentle, less frequent exfoliation with mild chemical exfoliants.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Normal Skin</b><span>: Typically resilient, but still benefits from regular, balanced exfoliation to maintain its clarity. </span><span>O3+ Volcano Scrub Normal To Oily Skin </span><span>can be used regularly for mild removal of dead skin cells.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Dry Skin</b><span>: Characterised by flakiness and rough texture. Exfoliation can help remove dry skin patches, but it's important to use hydrating exfoliants and to moisturise well after. </span><span>O3+ Milk Scrub for Dry Skin </span><span>offers deep moisturization while providing gentle exfoliation for the skin. This powerful formula efficiently removes blackheads and whiteheads, to bring forth a smoother and more radiant complexion. It is a great choice for dehydrated and dry skin. </span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Oily Skin</b><span>: Often appears shiny and greasy and can benefit from more frequent exfoliation to unclog pores and reduce oiliness. </span><span>Sesderma Mandelac Scrub Exfoliante </span><span>contains Mandelic Acid that accelerates the skin turnover to reveal radiant skin below. Also, it gets absorbed slowly, thereby causing less irritation to the skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Combination Skin</b><span>: Has areas that are both oily and dry. It might require different exfoliation strategies for different areas of the face. </span><span>Bioderma Sebium Pore Refiner</span><span> is a skincare product that exfoliates, rejuvenates, and refines the skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<b>METHODS OF EXFOLIATION</b><span>:</span>
</h3>
<h4>
<b>Mechanical Exfoliation</b><span>: </span>
</h4>
<p><span>Some key pointers for mechanical exfoliation are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Involves physical tools like brushes, sponges, or scrubs that manually remove dead skin cells. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Ideal for those with normal to oily skin, but may be too harsh for sensitive or damaged skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Dry scrubbing is also trending these days. It employs using a bristle brush on a bare, dry skin to remove dead skin and improve blood circulation. However, it can cause damage to the skin barrier if not done properly.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Chemical Exfoliation</b><span>: <br/></span></p>
<p><span>Some basics about chemical exfoliation are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Uses skincare products with acids like alpha and beta hydroxy acids to gently dissolve dead skin cells. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Suitable for most skin types, including sensitive skin, provided the right concentration and type of acid is chosen.</span></p>

<br/>
<p><span>Understanding it in detail:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong> Assess Skin Care Products</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Be aware of any current skin care products that might sensitise the skin, such as retinoids or benzoyl peroxide. These can amplify the effects of exfoliation, sometimes leading to irritation.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong> Select Appropriate Exfoliation Method</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Individuals with sensitive, dry, or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-nia-serum">acne-prone skin </a>may benefit from gentle chemical exfoliants. Those with thicker, oily skin may handle stronger chemical treatments or mechanical methods. However, people with darker skin tones or those who develop dark spots post-injury should be cautious with aggressive exfoliation.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong> Technique Matters</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Apply scrubs or chemical exfoliators with gentle, circular motions for about 30 seconds, then rinse with lukewarm water. For brushes or sponges, use light, short strokes. Avoid exfoliating sunburned or wounded skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong> Moisturization is Key</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Exfoliating can strip the skin of natural oils, making moisturization crucial post-exfoliation to maintain skin health.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong> Personalise Exfoliation Schedule</strong><span><strong>:</strong> The frequency depends on skin type and the chosen method. Aggressive exfoliation should be done less frequently, while gentle exfoliation can be more regular. Over-exfoliation can lead to irritated, red skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong> Consult a Dermatologist</strong><span><strong>.</strong> For those unsure about their skin type or the best exfoliation method, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">consulting a board-certified dermatologist</a> is advisable. A </span><span>dermatologist</span><span> can assess your skin's condition and provide tailored advice, ensuring that exfoliation is both safe and beneficial for your skin health.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Discussing the above table in a detailed format below:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<strong> Pore Purification</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Exfoliation acts as an intensive cleansing process that aids in removing layers of dead skin and surface debris. This action is crucial in preventing these elements from settling into pores, which often leads to the formation of whiteheads and blackheads. Regular exfoliation ensures pores remain clear and less prone to blockages, maintaining a smoother skin surface.<br/><br/></span><b>2. Acne Alleviation</b><span>: By consistently clearing out pores, exfoliation significantly reduces the likelihood of acne outbreaks. Since acne is often the result of clogged pores, the preventative clearing of these pores is a proactive way to manage acne-prone skin, leading to fewer breakouts and a clearer complexion<br/><br/></span><strong>3. Enhanced Absorption</strong><span><strong>: </strong>Exfoliation removes the outermost barrier of dead skin cells, allowing for better penetration of other skincare products. This means that serums, moisturisers, and nourishing treatments can delve deeper into the skin layers, working more effectively. Consequently, your skincare regimen becomes more efficient, providing greater benefits to the skin.<br/><br/></span><strong>4. Tone Uniformity</strong><span><strong>: </strong>Regular exfoliation helps to gradually <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">fade away dark spots, hyperpigmentation</a>, and the residual marks from acne scars. This leads to a more uniform skin tone over time. As dead and discoloured skin cells are removed, newer and more evenly pigmented cells take their place, resulting in a brighter and more consistent complexion.<br/><br/></span><b>5. Circulation Booster</b><span>: The physical action of exfoliating stimulates blood flow and enhances lymphatic drainage. This increased circulation not only detoxifies the skin by flushing out toxins but also brings a healthy, radiant glow to the skin’s surface. Improved blood flow ensures that skin cells are well-nourished, enhancing overall skin health.<br/><br/></span><b>6. Cell Renewal Stimulator</b><span>: Exfoliation encourages the turnover of skin cells. By routinely removing the older, duller skin cells on the surface, it paves the way for new cell growth underneath. This renewal process is key to maintaining a vibrant, youthful look, as fresh, healthy cells are always at the skin's surface, giving it a natural, radiant glow.<br/><br/></span><b>7. Collagen Catalyst</b><span>: One of the less visible but highly beneficial effects of exfoliation is its ability to stimulate collagen production. Collagen is a vital protein that maintains skin elasticity and firmness. Regular exfoliation can help boost collagen synthesis, which is essential in keeping the skin plump, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-skin-renewer-retinol-serum">minimising the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles,</a> and thereby preserving a youthful appearance</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>To sum up, the various benefits of exfoliation extend far beyond just surface-level improvements. It's a vital skincare practice that not only enhances the skin's aesthetic appeal but also fortifies its health from within. It not only maintains a clear and smooth complexion, but also optimises the effectiveness of other skincare products by ensuring deeper penetration. Uniform skin tone and stimulated cell renewal contribute to a consistently fresh and youthful appearance. Moreover, the boost in circulation and collagen production provided by exfoliation and scrubbing cultivates the skin's natural vitality and resilience. Regular and mindful exfoliation thus emerges as an integral way-out in the pursuit of healthy, radiant, and rejuvenated skin.</span></p>
<h3><b>Why is Exfoliation Important for Skin?</b></h3>
<p><span>Exfoliation, the process of shedding old skin cells, is essential for skin health. As the largest organ of the body, the skin undergoes a natural renewal cycle, moving the cells from lower layers of skin to the surface. This process slows down with age and it leads to a buildup of dead cells, often exacerbated by the consistent use of topical skincare products, resulting in clogged pores and potential skin issues like acne.</span></p>
<p><span>Old, unhealthy skin cells contribute to a lacklustre, dry, and rough appearance, whereas exfoliated skin appears smoother, tighter, and more vibrant. With daily application of makeup and skincare products, the face can undergo stress, accelerating signs of ageing like fine lines, wrinkles, and a dull complexion. Moreover, dry skin can trigger increased oil production as the body attempts to compensate for the lack of moisture, potentially leading to clogged pores and acne.</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, regular exfoliation is key to maintaining a healthy skin cell turnover, ensuring a radiant, smooth complexion while also aiding to mitigate common skin concerns.</span></p>
<h3><b>Different Methods of Exfoliation</b></h3>
<p><span>Exfoliation can be done in many different ways such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Enzymatic exfoliation:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span>It offers a gentle yet effective way of skin rejuvenation that is particularly suitable for sensitive skin. It employs natural enzymes, derived from fruits like papaya and pineapple or grains such as rice which are capable of effectively dissolving keratin- the protein that binds dead skin cells together, thereby facilitating the release of these dead cells and thus aiding in pore unclogging. </span></p>
<p><span>iS Clinical Warming Honey Cleanser</span><span> is a great addition to your closet for achieving that radiant glow as it utilises papaya enzymes to aid in deep exfoliation along with <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hyaluronic-skinbooster-serum">ensuring hydrated skin.</a></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>Chemical exfoliation :</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>It is one of the latest methods of skin exfoliation that works by dissolving the protein bonds that hold dead skin cells together. It assists in shedding of dead, flaky skin, thereby revealing a rejuvenated and radiant complexion beneath. Chemical exfoliants are highly effective in improving the appearance of scars and hyperpigmentation; however, these must be used judiciously to avoid potential skin damage from overuse. Alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs) are the most prevalent forms of chemical exfoliants. These are usually derived from natural sources. They effectively target the concerns related to dryness, ageing, and<a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-sunprotect-sunscreen-spf-50"> sun-damaged skin.</a></span></p>
<p><span>Glintra Foaming Face Wash </span><span>further aids in mild exfoliation as salicylic acid sloughs the dead skin cells and glycolic acid breaks down the bonds between dead skin cells. This results in deep exfoliation to rejuvenate the skin.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong> Physical exfoliation:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>It utilises textured elements like grains, microbeads, or scrub-like materials to remove dead skin cells from the outermost layer of skin. The immediate effect of physical exfoliants is a skin that feels instantly smoother and refreshed. Popular choices in this category range from sugar scrubs and finely ground coffee to exfoliating brushes and microdermabrasion techniques. It is usually recommended to use physical exfoliants for body care, rather than on facial skin as it may cause micro-tears onto the skin. </span></p>
<p><span>Everyuth Naturals Exfoliating Walnut Scrub </span><span>contains micro particles of walnut that facilitates the removal of dead skin cells from the skin surface. As a result, smoother skin is unveiled underneath.</span></p>
<h3><b>How to Choose Frequency &amp; Timing of Exfoliation</b></h3>
<p><span>To optimise the benefits of exfoliation while minimising potential drawbacks, it's often a matter of trial and error to find the right balance for your skin type. Here's an expanded guide on how to approach exfoliation based on different skin types:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Normal Skin:</strong> Individuals with normal skin are generally recommended to begin exfoliating about two to three times a week. This frequency typically provides the benefits of exfoliation, such as smoother skin and unclogged pores, without causing irritation.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Dry Skin:</strong> People with dry or sensitive skin should exercise caution and limit exfoliation to a maximum of twice a week so as to prevent excess drying out of the already sensitive skin. If using products like </span><span>retinoids</span><span> that can further dry out and irritate the skin, consider reducing the frequency to once a week or even every other week.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Sensitive Skin:</strong> For individuals with rosacea, eczema, exfoliation may often cause more harm than good. In such cases, dermatologists typically advise against exfoliating to prevent exacerbating redness, irritation, or stinging associated with the condition.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Combination Skin:</strong> Those with combination skin, which features areas of both oiliness and dryness, can usually safely exfoliate twice a week. This helps in balancing the skin, addressing both the oily zones and the drier patches effectively.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Oily Skin:</strong> People with oily skin may find that they can exfoliate more frequently, approximately two to three times a week. In some cases, depending on the reaction of their skin and the methods or products used, they might even increase the frequency slightly.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>However, if you are using an exfoliating cleanser daily, such as </span><span>Cetaphil Daily Exfoliating Cleanser</span><span>, you might not need additional exfoliation. It is recommended to always observe your skin’s response to exfoliation. If you notice dryness, redness, irritation, or breakouts, it is indicative of indulging in excessive exfoliation. In such a scenario, it is recommended to step down on the exfoliation. Furthermore, it’s crucial to avoid exfoliating areas with sunburn, rashes, or open cuts, as this can lead to further skin damage.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re unsure, or if your skin has specific conditions like rosacea, eczema, </span><span>consulting with a dermatologist</span><span> is always the best choice as they can provide personalised advice and help you find the most suitable exfoliation routine for your skin type.</span></p>
<h2><b>Understanding Body Scrubs<br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="Understanding Body Scrubs" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_4_-_2024-01-04T111921.851_480x480.png?v=1704347380"/></div>
<p><span>The body undergoes a process called Desquamation wherein the cells of the upper layer of the skin naturally get loosened and in turn get shed off. To facilitate the removal of these dead skin cells, usually physical scrubs are employed. </span></p>
<p><span>Physical scrubs are an ideal choice for exfoliation of the body as the microbeads and particles present in these scrubs ensure effective removal of the dead skin cells. The body has relatively thicker skin than that of the face. As a result, the chances of micro tears due to abrasive action of physical scrubs is quite minimal. Also, due to continuous friction in various body parts such as elbows and knees, hyperpigmentation generally develops. In such a scenario, regular exfoliation becomes more important, so as to remove dead and keratinized skin.</span></p>
<h3><b>Types of Body Scrubs and Their Benefits</b></h3>
<p><span>All the body scrubs, though similar in way they act, yet perform differently due to differences in the basic composition.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4><strong> Salt Scrubs:<br/></strong></h4>
<span>Salt is a natural abrasive and it removes dead skin cells very gently. Also, few researches point out in the direction that Magnesium present in dead sea water scrub enhances the barrier function of the skin. As a result, hydration level of the skin improved significantly, and transepidermal water loss decreased, especially in people suffering from Atopic Dermatitis or Eczema.</span><span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<h4><strong> Sugar Scrubs:<br/></strong></h4>
<span>Sugar particles are a natural abrasive that ensure dead cell removal in a mild way. Also, sugar, being a humectant, tends to absorb water from the surroundings, as a result, it not only removes the dead skin cells but also hydrates and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hydrasoothe-moisturiser">moisturises the skin.</a></span><span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<h4><strong> Coffee Scrubs:<br/></strong></h4>
<span>Coffee is a reservoir of antioxidants. When used as a scrub, it not only removes the dead skin cells in a delicate way, but also decreases the damage caused by free radicals on the skin surface. A component present in coffee, referred to as caffeic acid, exhibits antibacterial properties. Apart from that, few researches also point towards exhibition of skin protective action against damage caused by UV rays to the skin. It also has cellulite reducing properties as it drastically improves microcirculation and collagen building.</span><span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<h4><strong> Lavender Scrubs:<br/></strong></h4>
<span>Micro particles of lavender apart from removing dead skin cells, also exhibit nerve calming properties. It also exhibits skin soothing and anti-inflammatory action.</span><span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<h4><strong> Charcoal Body Scrubs:<br/></strong></h4>
<span>Activated charcoal shows the property of skin adsorption. It refers to drawing out the skin impurities from the clogged pores to the skin surface, thereby ensuring its effective removal. Apart from that it also absorbs body odour.</span><span><br/></span>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>How to Choose the Right Body Scrub Ingredients</b></h3>
<p><span>Not all body scrubs are the same. Their basic ingredient often determines the skin type for which that body scrub is ideal for.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>If you have dry and sensitive skin, usually salt scrubs are recommended as these are proven to improve the skin barrier function, hence making it a great choice for people suffering with eczema.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>If you have dry skin, usually a milder physical exfoliant, such as lavender scrub is recommended. It is very gentle on the skin as it not only removes the dead skin cells but also moisturises and nourishes the skin due to the presence of lavender oil. It also exhibits skin and nerve calming properties.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>If you have an oily skin, charcoal body scrub can add huge value to your skincare regimen due to its adsorption action. It gently pulls out the sebum, dirt and other particles from the clogged pores, thereby reducing the chances of acne breakouts.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>If you are blessed with a normal and resilient skin, coffee scrubs are an ideal choice, as these not only gently remove the dead skin cells but also provide an instant and radiant glow to the skin.</span></p>
</li>

<p><span>Choosing between physical and chemical exfoliation can be a task. To ensure that you pick up the right option, below are a few tips and tricks to aid you in determining the right fit.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Chemical exfoliation ensures gentle removal of debris and dead skin cells. However, choosing the correct chemical is of utmost importance as it has a huge impact on the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>It is recommended to do a patch test before using a chemical exfoliant so as to avoid any adverse reaction.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Physical scrubs effectively remove dead skin cells. However, these may cause microtears due to the abrasive nature. Hence, it is recommended to use it on thick skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Also, generally skin exfoliation should be done once in 4-7 days. Depending on the type of product, it can be done twice a week or once a week. If the product is mild such as lactic acid based scrub or lavender scrub, it can be used twice in a week. However, if the product contains strong chemicals such as salicylic acid or has coarse granules such as apricot based scrub, it is best to use it once in a week.</span></p>

<h3><b>How to Incorporate Body Scrubs and Exfoliation into Your Skincare Routine</b></h3>
<p><span>Scrubbing and Exfoliation is an important step in skin care. Not only face, but legs, arms and shoulders also deserve some tender love and care. One of the most effective ways to incorporate it into your daily regimen is to use it at the time of shower. It is necessary to ensure effective removal of dead skin cells and to increase the epidermal turnover. </span></p>
<p><span>Few pointers that need to be kept in mind while indulging in scrubbing and exfoliation are mentioned below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Exfoliation or scrubbing is to be done on a clean surface. Hence, cleansing or bathing with a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-foaming-face-wash">good cleanser/</a> soap/ face wash /shower gel is recommended prior to exfoliation or scrubbing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>It is recommended to indulge in it one to three times a week. Over exfoliation and over scrubbing should be avoided as it can lead to compromised skin barrier.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The frequency of exfoliating depends on the area that needs to be scrubbed. Due to sun exposure, and friction, face, shoulders and arms may need to be exfoliated thrice a week, whereas legs could be scrubbed once in a week.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>While exfoliating the face, it is advised to be gentle in the <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-ultra-heal-under-eye-cream">under-eye area</a> as the skin there is weak. Excess scrubbing may cause microtears or hyperpigmentation in the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Do not forget to exfoliate lips so as to unveil a plumped and clean surface underneath. </span><span>iS Clinical Lip Duo </span><span>is a great choice.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Lastly, scrub the heels with a mechanical scrub such as pumice.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3><b>Debunking Common Myths About Scrubbing and Exfoliating</b></h3>
<p><span>With an increasing awareness of scrubbing and exfoliating, somehow, there is an aura of confusion as well regarding its usage. Five most common misbeliefs are discussed and debunked below:</span></p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<strong> <i>Only granular scrub is the actual scrub.</i></strong><span>No, while the scrubs containing granules and beads feel great on skin and are a perfect physical scrub, there is an upstream in the influx of chemical scrubs lately. These are usually mild acids, referred to as Alpha Hydroxy-Acids (AHA’s) and Beta Hydroxy-Acids (BHA’s) that remove dead skin cells by weakening the bonds between the skin cells and thereby shedding it off.</span><span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<strong> <i>Scrubbing and exfoliation should be done twice daily to remove dead skin cells.</i></strong><span>No, to ensure daily hygiene, it is recommended to cleanse the face with a face cleanser twice daily. However, scrubbing or exfoliation should only be done twice or thrice in a week as excess scrubbing and exfoliation can compromise the skin barrier.<br/><br/></span><span><strong>3. Only the face needs to be scrubbed.</strong></span>No, while the face is the most visible thing and is to be scrubbed/ exfoliated regularly; other body parts also require some tender love-care. Sun and pollution exposure, friction, physical activities like swimming etc. also take a toll on other body parts such as feet, legs, elbows etc.<br/><br/><strong>4. Body scrubs can be used on the face.</strong>No, the scrubs used on the body are harsh as compared to the facial scrubs. The skin of the face is thin and delicate, hence milder scrubs are recommended for usage<br/><br/>.<strong>5.All the face scrubs are the same.</strong>It’s just the sales stunt of the companies to sell different products for different skin types.No, it is a wrong perception. Using the chemical exfoliant containing salicylic acid on dry skin will further deteriorate the skin barrier and more harm will be done. Hence, always use skincare products specific for your skin type.</li>
