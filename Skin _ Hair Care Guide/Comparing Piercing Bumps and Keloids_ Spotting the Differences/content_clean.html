<p><span>Two typical skin disorders that can develop after obtaining a piercing are piercing bumps and keloids. Despite having a similar appearance, there are some significant differences between the two. Small, raised bumps called "piercing bumps" can develop near a piercing. They may have a pink or red color and include pus or other fluids. Usually, discomfort or stress at the piercing site results in piercing bumps. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as using inexpensive jewellery, neglecting to properly clean the piercing, or having an inexperienced piercer perform the piercing. The majority of the time, piercing bumps are not serious and can be cleaned with a saline solution to prevent further discomfort. On the other hand, keloids are thickened, elevated regions of scar tissue that can appear at the site of a wound, piercing, or other damage. In contrast to piercing bumps, keloids are brought on by too much scar tissue rather than an infection or inflammation. They might extend beyond the initial wound's area and be larger than piercing pimples. Keloids, which can be unpleasant or itchy, are more common in those with darker skin. In extreme situations, surgery may be necessary in addition to the usual medical therapies, such as steroid injections.</span></p>
<h2><b>Understanding Piercing Bumps</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="Piercing Bumps and Keloids" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Piercing_Bumps_and_Keloids_5_480x480.png?v=1683628510"/></b></p>
<p>Small, raised bumps known as "piercing bumps" can form near a piercing site. They are a frequent problem that can develop after getting a piercing, especially in places like the navel, earlobes, and nostrils. Numerous factors, such as irritability, infection, and trauma to the piercing site, can result in piercing bumps. Irritation is the most frequent reason for piercing bumps. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as using low-quality jewellery, replacing jewellery too frequently, or improper piercing cleaning. The body responds to irritation at the piercing site by overproducing scar tissue, which can lead to the development of a bump.</p>
<p>Infection can also result in piercing bumps in addition to irritation. There may be redness, swelling, soreness, and drainage from an infected piercing. An infected piercing may develop a lump if it is not addressed. Trauma to the piercing site is another reason for piercing bumps. This can happen if the jewellery is overly tight or heavy, the piercing is pulled or snagged, or both. A bump may develop as a result of the body producing too much scar tissue as a result of trauma. The source and degree of the piercing bumps determine the appropriate course of treatment. With the right cleaning and care, the lump could go away on its own in mild situations.</p>
<p>This might entail avoiding touching or aggravating the region and washing the piercing site with a saline solution. In more extreme situations, a medical practitioner might advise using oral or topical antibiotics or even taking off the jewellery to let the bump heal. Although piercing bumps are common, it is important to remember that they can also be an indication of a more serious problem, such as an allergic reaction or an infection. It is crucial to seek medical assistance from a healthcare provider if you have a piercing lump that is painful, does not go away with simple care, or is coupled with other symptoms like fever or chills.</p>
<h3><b>Causes of Piercing Bumps</b></h3>
<p><span>Piercing bumps can result from a number of factors, including:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Irritation</strong>: The most common cause of piercing bumps is irritation. This can occur as a result of using low-quality jewellery, changing it too frequently, or failing to clean the piercing properly.   When the piercing site becomes irritated, the body responds by producing excess scar tissue, which can cause a bump to form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Infection</b><span>: Piercings can become infected if proper hygiene is not maintained. Redness, swelling, pain, and discharge are all symptoms of an infected piercing. If left untreated, an infected piercing can result in the formation of a bump.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Allergic reactions</strong>: Some people may be allergic to the metal used in jewellery, especially if it contains nickel. This can cause an itchy, red rash around the piercing site, as well as the formation of a bump.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trauma</strong>: Piercing site trauma, such as pulling or snagging the jewellery, can cause the body to produce excess scar tissue, resulting in the formation of a bump.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Improper technique</b><span>: If the piercing is not done by an experienced and licensed professional, the risk of developing piercing bumps increases.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Genetics</b><span>: Some people may be predisposed to developing piercing bumps due to genetic factors.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>You should take good care of your piercing and keep an eye out for any infections or signs of irritation. If you have a piercing bump or any other unsettling symptoms, you should seek medical attention immediately.</span></p>
<h3><b>Types of Piercing Bumps</b></h3>
<p><span>There are various kinds of piercing bumps that might develop, including:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Hypertrophic Scars</b><span>: These raised, red bumps can be painful or itchy. They are caused by an excess of scar tissue and can appear near the site of the piercing. Trauma or irritation may result in hypertrophic scars, which are more frequent in cartilage piercings.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Keloids</b><span>: Keloids resemble hypertrophic scars but are more severe and larger. They are caused by an excess of collagen in the skin and can spread beyond the original piercing site. Keloids, which can itch or hurt, tend to develop more frequently in people with darker skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Granulomas</strong>: Around the piercing site, granulomas, which are tiny, red bumps, may appear. They frequently contain pus or other fluids and are usually the result of an inflammatory reaction to the jewellery. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Abscesses</b><span>: Abscesses are pockets of pus that can develop around the piercing site. They could also come with other infection-related symptoms like pain, swelling, and redness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Follicular Cysts</b><span>: Follicular cysts can form near the piercing site due to a blockage of the hair follicles.  Typically, they are tiny, painless bumps that occasionally contain fluid or a white substance.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It is significant to note that different causes and possible treatments for these kinds of piercing bumps exist. It is important to <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">seek medical advice </a>from a healthcare provider if you are unsure of the type of piercing bump you have or how to treat it.</span></p>
<h3><b>How to Prevent Piercing Bumps</b></h3>
<p><span>You can take the following actions to stop piercing bumps from forming:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Select high-quality jewellery</strong>: Make certain that the jewellery you select is made of high-quality materials, such as surgical steel or titanium. Avoid wearing nickel-containing jewellery because it can cause an allergic reaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid changing your jewellery too soon</strong>: Wait until your piercing is completely healed before changing your jewellery. Changing the jewellery too soon can irritate the piercing site and increase the likelihood of a bump developing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Adopt good hygiene</b><span>: Wash the piercing site twice daily with a saline solution or mild soap. Make sure to thoroughly clean your hands before touching the piercing in order to avoid touching it with unclean hands.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid trauma</strong>: Be careful not to snag or pull on the jewellery, and avoid sleeping on the side of the piercing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Follow aftercare instructions</b><span>: Make sure to follow your piercer's aftercare instructions. This may include refraining from swimming or engaging in other activities that may expose the piercing to bacteria or irritants.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consider your placement</b><span>: Certain areas of the body, such as cartilage piercings, may be more prone to developing bumps. Consider where your piercing is located and whether it is more prone to developing bumps.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Seek professional assistance</b><span>: Ensure that the person who performs your piercing is qualified, uses sterile tools, and observes proper hygiene procedures.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Remember, if you develop a piercing bump, it is important to seek medical advice from a healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment.</span></p>
<h2><b>Exploring Keloids</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="Piercing Bumps and Keloids" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Piercing_Bumps_and_Keloids_3_480x480.png?v=1683628543"/></b></p>
<p><span>The scar tissue that develops at the site of an accident or incision, including a piercing, is elevated and thickened to form keloids. Keloids may continue to grow past the original size of the wound, in contrast to regular scars, which often fade with time, leaving a raised and bumpy appearance. Due to their appearance, keloids may cause mental anguish in addition to being painful or irritating. Keloids can develop following any kind of skin damage, but those with darker complexions are more likely to develop them. They can appear anywhere on the body, but the chest, back, shoulders, and earlobes are where they most frequently appear. Although the exact cause of keloids is unknown, it is thought that an excess of collagen, the protein that makes up the body's connective tissue, is to blame. Some people may be genetically predisposed to getting keloids, due to a number of risk factors. Treatment for keloids can be difficult, and no single approach works for everyone. Injections of corticosteroids, laser therapy, cryotherapy, and surgery are some treatment options. To find the best course of action for your unique situation, it is crucial to review treatment choices with a healthcare practitioner. For those with a high risk of developing keloids, preventative actions may also be advised, such as refraining from getting body alterations like piercings.</span></p>
<h3><b>What are Keloids?</b></h3>
<p><span>Scar tissue that has expanded and elevated at the site of an accident or wound, including a piercing, is known as a keloids. They can appear anywhere on the body, but are more frequent on the chest, back, shoulders, and earlobes of those with darker complexions. In contrast to typical scars, keloids continue to grow past the size of the wound, giving them a raised and bumpy look. Due to their appearance, they may cause mental discomfort in addition to being painful or irritating. Despite the fact that the precise cause of keloids is unknown, an abundance of collagen, the protein that makes up the body's connective tissue, is thought to be to blame. Numerous risk factors, such as the following, can increase the likelihood of developing keloids, including the possibility that some people are genetically predisposed to developing them:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>There is a family history of keloids.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>deeper skin tone</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>severe acne or chicken pox in the past.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Prior keloid development</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Body piercings, tattoos, or other alterations</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>There is no one method of treatment for keloids that is effective for everyone, which makes it difficult. Injections of corticosteroids, surgery, laser therapy, cryotherapy, or pressure therapy are all possible forms of treatment. To find the best course of action for your unique situation, it is crucial to review treatment choices with a healthcare practitioner. For those with a high risk of developing keloids, preventative actions may also be advised, such as refraining from getting body alterations like piercings.</span></p>
<h3><b>Causes of Keloids</b></h3>
<p><span>Although the precise cause of keloids is unknown, it is thought that an excess of collagen, the protein that makes up the body's connective tissue, is to blame. Any type of skin injury, including surgical incisions, burns, acne, chickenpox, and piercings, can result in keloids. However, some people are more genetically predisposed to getting keloids, and certain risk factors, such as the following, can make getting keloids more likely:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Keloids in the family's past</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>increased skin tone</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>being under 30 years of age</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Having a baby</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>having certain medical conditions, such as thyroid disease or diabetes</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Keloids can also develop after surgery in a high-tension area of the body, like the shoulder or back, or in response to increased tension or pressure on the skin, such as at the site of an earlobe piercing. Not everyone who experiences these risk factors will develop keloids; keloids can also form in people who do not experience any known risk factors. This is important to keep in mind.</span></p>
<h3><b>Factors that Increase the Risk of Keloids</b></h3>
<p><span>There are a number of things that can make you more likely to get keloids, such as:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Family history</b><span>: You might be more likely to get keloids if a family member has a history of them.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skin color</b><span>: Individuals with darker skin, such as those of African, Asian, or Hispanic descent, are more likely to develop keloids.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Age</b><span>: The majority of keloid cases occur before the age of 30, and younger people are more likely to develop them.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Gender</b><span>: Women are more likely than men to develop keloids.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Wound location</b><span>: In places where the skin is under more strain or pressure, such as the earlobes, chest, back, shoulders, or upper arms, keloids are more likely to develop.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Type of injury</b><span>: Keloids can develop after any type of injury to the skin, including burns, surgery, acne, chickenpox, and piercings.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hormonal changes</b><span>: Keloids may enlarge while a woman is pregnant or while she is taking hormonal therapy.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Medical conditions</b><span>: Diabetes and thyroid disease both increase the risk of keloid formation. </span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It is important to note that keloids do not develop in everyone with these risk factors, and keloids can form in people who do not have any known risk factors.</span></p>
<h3><b>Keloid Prevention and Treatment</b></h3>
<p><span>Keloids can be difficult to avoid, but there are some precautions you can take:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Avoid any unnecessary skin trauma or injury, such as piercings or tattoos.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>To reduce scarring, treat acne or other skin conditions as soon as possible.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Proper wound care techniques, such as keeping the wound clean and covered, can help reduce scarring after an injury or surgery.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Avoid exposing healing wounds to direct sunlight or tanning beds, as this can increase scarring.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>In areas prone to keloids, avoid wearing clothing or jewelry that is too tight or restrictive.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>If you do develop a keloid, you may have the following treatment options:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Injections of corticosteroids</b><span>: These injections can help to lessen swelling and reduce the size of the keloid.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Surgery</b><span>: Surgical removal of the keloid may be an option in some circumstances, but there is a chance that it will grow or return.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Laser therapy</b><span>: A high-energy light is used in this treatment to break down scar tissue and promote the growth of healthy skin cells.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cryotherapy</b><span>: This procedure kills keloid tissue by freezing it to death; new, healthy skin cells are then produced in its place.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Pressure therapy</b><span>: This involves applying pressure to the keloid using a specialized dressing or compression device, which can help to flatten the keloid and reduce its size.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It is important to remember that keloid therapy can be difficult and that no one method will be effective for all patients. To find the best course of action for your unique situation, it is crucial to review treatment choices with a healthcare practitioner.</span></p>
<h2><b>Distinguishing Between Piercing Bumps and Keloids</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="Piercing Bumps and Keloids" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Piercing_Bumps_and_Keloids_2_480x480.png?v=1683628384"/></b></p>
<p><span>Piercing bumps and keloids may appear similar, but there are some key differences that can help differentiate the two:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Appearance</b><span>: Piercing bumps commonly take the form of tiny, raised, red or pink bumps near the piercing site. They might itch or hurt, and they might discharge. Keloids, on the other hand, are typically larger, thicker, raised scars that do not stop at the site of the original injury or wound.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Location</b><span>: While keloids can develop anywhere on the body, they are more frequently found in areas of high tension, such as the chest, back, shoulders, or upper arms. Piercing bumps are typically restricted to the area around the piercing site.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Development</b><span>: Usually appearing soon after obtaining a piercing, piercing bumps might last for a few weeks or months. On the other hand, keloids may take several months to appear following an operation or injury and may continue to enlarge.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Risk factors</b><span>: Piercing bumps can happen to anyone who gets a piercing, but keloids are more common in people with darker skin tones, those who have had keloids in the past, and those who have had scarring of any kind.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Treatment response</b><span>: Piercing bumps usually respond well to proper wound care, whereas keloids can be more difficult to treat and may necessitate more aggressive treatments such as corticosteroid injections, laser therapy, or surgical removal.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Symptoms and Appearance</b></h3>
<p><span>Piercing bumps and keloids can present with a variety of symptoms and appearances:</span></p>
<p><span>Bumps with Piercings:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Small, raised, red or pink bumps on the skin around the piercing site.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>It may be painful or itchy.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>There may be a discharge.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>They usually happen soon after getting a piercing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>This condition may last for several weeks or months.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Generally, they respond well to proper wound care.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Keloids:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Scars that are larger, thicker, and raised and extend beyond the boundaries of the original wound or injury.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>To the touch, it is firm and rubbery.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Itching or tenderness is possible.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>It is possible that it will continue to grow in size over time.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>This can happen months after the injury or surgery.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>They can occur anywhere on the body, but they are more common in high-tension areas.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>People with a family history of keloids, darker skin types, or who have previously had keloids or other types of scars are more likely to develop keloids.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>It's crucial to remember that keloids might be confused with hypertrophic scars, which are also thick, elevated scars but do not spread over the confines of the initial lesion or wound. Keloids and hypertrophic scars, on the other hand, can be itchy or painful and develop after an accident or surgery. Consult a dermatologist or a healthcare provider for guidance if you are unsure of the type of scar you are experiencing.</span></p>
<h3><b>Duration and Growth Patterns</b></h3>
<p><span>The duration and pattern of growth of piercing bumps and keloids can vary:</span></p>
<p><span>Piercing Bumps:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Typically occurs shortly after getting a piercing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>This could last for several weeks or months.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Usually improves with proper wound care.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Keloids:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>It can take several months to recover from an injury or surgery.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>It is possible that it will continue to grow in size over time.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>This can happen months or years after the original injury or surgery.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Growth can be slow and continuous, or it can come to a halt after a certain point.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Recurrence is possible after treatment or surgical removal.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>It's important to keep in mind that not all elevated scars from operations or injuries are keloids. The hypertrophic scar, which does not cover the area of the initial wound or injury and typically improves over time, is another elevated scar that can form after surgery or an injury. If you are unsure of the kind of scar you are experiencing, seek advice from a dermatologist or other healthcare professional.</span></p>
<h3><b>Treatment and Management Options</b></h3>
<p><span>The severity and type of the bump or scar will determine the best course of treatment and management for piercing bumps and keloids, which can vary:</span></p>
<p><span>Piercing Bumps:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The removal of piercing bumps can frequently be assisted by using proper wound care, which includes cleaning the piercing with a saline solution and avoiding trauma or irritation to the area.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>To manage pain or discomfort, over-the-counter painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs may be suggested.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Antibiotics may be prescribed if an infection is the reason for the piercing bump.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Keloids:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Keloids may be reduced in size and appearance with topical treatments like silicone gels or sheets.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Injections of corticosteroids can aid in the reduction of keloids by lowering inflammation and slowing the development of scar tissue.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The scar tissue can be reduced with cryotherapy, which involves freezing the keloid with liquid nitrogen.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The redness and thickness of keloids can both be decreased with laser therapy.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Some people may choose to have the keloid surgically removed, but there is a chance of recurrence and the scar may be more obvious. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Some patients may benefit from combination therapies, such as corticosteroid injections followed by surgical removal.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>It's significant to remember that not all keloids require treatment, and some may get better on their own with time. A dermatologist or healthcare provider should be consulted if you have a keloid or piercing bump as they can suggest the best course of action based on your unique needs and the severity of the condition.</span></p>
