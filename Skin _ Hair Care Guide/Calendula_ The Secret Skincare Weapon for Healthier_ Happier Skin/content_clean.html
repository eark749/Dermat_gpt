<p><span>The daisy family also includes calendula, sometimes referred to as "pot marigold." Its vivid yellow or orange blossoms have been used in traditional medicine and cosmetics for generations. Due to its anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant characteristics, calendula has a number of skin advantages. To calm and moisturize the skin, encourage healing, and lessen the appearance of inflammation and redness, it is frequently used in skincare products.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Origins of Calendula in Skincare</b></h3>
<p><span>Since ancient times, calendula has been used in traditional medicine and cosmetics. It is thought to have its roots in the Mediterranean region and has been used historically as tea, tinctures, and oils, among other forms. Ancient civilizations, including the Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians, also utilized calendula for its therapeutic and skincare benefits. Because of its anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and calming characteristics, calendula is still frequently used in skin care products today.</span></p>
<h3><b>Active Components of Calendula</b></h3>
<p><span>Flavonoids, carotenoids, triterpenoids, and saponins are some of the plant's active ingredients. The primary antioxidant and anti-inflammatory flavonoids in calendula include quercetin, isorhamnetin, and kaempferol. The antioxidant properties of the carotenoids—including lutein and beta-carotene—help shield the skin from free radicals. Faradiol and lupeol are two examples of triterpenoids with anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities. The saponins also have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, such as calendulosides A and B.</span></p>
