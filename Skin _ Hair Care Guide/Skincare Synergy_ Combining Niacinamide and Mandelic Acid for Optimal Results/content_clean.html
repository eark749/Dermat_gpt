It can also help to brighten the skin and reduce the visibility of hyperpigmentation and acne scars. Furthermore, mandelic acid has been shown to improve skin barrier function, which can help reduce moisture loss and improve overall skin health.</span></p>
<p><span>When using niacinamide and mandelic acid in your skincare routine, it's important to start with a low concentration of mandelic acid and to patch-test any new products before incorporating them into your routine. Additionally, be sure to follow the instructions for each product to ensure that you're using them in the correct order and getting the most benefit from each one.</span></p>

<p><span>Yes, niacinamide can be used in conjunction with mandelic acid. In fact, combining these two ingredients can provide even more benefits for the skin. Niacinamide can calm the skin and reduce inflammation, while mandelic acid can exfoliate and brighten the skin. However, you should begin with a low concentration of both ingredients and patch-test any new products before incorporating them into your skincare routine. This can make sure there are no negative side effects from the niacinamide and mandelic acid combination on your skin. Additionally, when using these ingredients during the day, it is critical to use sunscreen because they can increase skin sensitivity to the sun.</span></p>
<h3><b>Evaluating the Compatibility of Ingredients</b></h3>
<p><span>Not all skincare ingredients are compatible with one another, and some combinations can even be harmful to the skin. Therefore, it is essential to take compatibility into account before incorporating an ingredient into your skincare routine.  Here are some things to consider when assessing ingredient compatibility:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>pH levels</b><span>: Certain skincare ingredients work best at specific pH levels. For example, vitamin C works best at pH levels of 3.5 or lower, whereas AHAs such as mandelic acid work best at pH levels of 3 to 4. If you're using multiple products with varying pH levels, it's critical to use them in the correct order to ensure their effectiveness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Concentrations</b><span>: In high concentrations, some skincare ingredients can be irritating to the skin. Using too much retinol, for example, can result in redness and peeling. To avoid overexposure to certain ingredients, it is critical to follow the recommended usage instructions for each product.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Layering</b><span>: Some skincare ingredients can be combined, while others must be used separately. <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/vitamin-c-serum-for-face">Vitamin C </a>and AHAs, for example, can be used together but should be applied at different times to avoid irritation. As a general rule, apply products with a thinner consistency first, followed by thicker products.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sensitivity</b><span>: Certain ingredients may cause sensitivities or allergies in some people. To avoid any negative reactions, it's critical to patch-test any new products before incorporating them into your skincare routine.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>You can develop an effective and safe skincare routine that addresses your specific skin concerns by considering the compatibility of ingredients and using them in the right order and concentrations.</span></p>

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use mandelic acid in the evening</b><span>: Mandelic acid is a natural exfoliant that can help to brighten and smooth the skin. It is best used in the evening to avoid sun sensitivity. Begin with a low concentration of mandelic acid, such as 5%, and gradually increase the concentration if your skin tolerates it well.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Alternate days</b><span>: When first incorporating niacinamide and mandelic acid into your skincare routine, it's best to alternate days to avoid any irritation. For example, you could use niacinamide in the morning and mandelic acid in the evening every other day.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Layer correctly</b><span>: If you're taking niacinamide and mandelic acid on the same day, it's critical that you take them in the correct order. Begin with the thinner consistency product, such as niacinamide serum, and then layer on the thicker consistency product, such as mandelic acid serum or cream.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use sunscreen</b><span>: Both niacinamide and mandelic acid can increase sensitivity to the sun, so it's important to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 during the day to protect your skin.</span></p>

<p><b>Introducing New Ingredients Gradually</b></p>
<p><span>Introduce new ingredients into your skincare routine gradually to lower the risk of irritation or adverse reactions. Here are some ideas for incorporating new ingredients into your routine:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Patch test</b><span>: Prior to applying a new product to your face, it's crucial to test it on a small patch of skin, such as the area behind your ear or the inside of your forearm.

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Start slow</b><span>: Begin by using the new ingredient once or twice a week, gradually increasing the frequency as your skin adapts. It is also critical to follow the product's recommended usage instructions.</span></p>
