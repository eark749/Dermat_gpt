Niacinamide and mandelic acid are two skincare ingredients that can be beneficial to your skin on their own, but when combined, they can be even more beneficial. Combining niacinamide and mandelic acid can help with a variety of skin issues, including exfoliation without irritation, improved skin barrier function, and a brighter skin tone. Start with a low mandelic acid concentration when using niacinamide and mandelic acid together, and always perform a patch test on new products before using them regularly. Follow the directions for each product carefully to make sure you're using them in the right order and getting the most out of each one.
Understanding Niacinamide and Mandelic Acid
Niacinamide and mandelic acid are two skincare ingredients that can benefit your skin greatly. Here is a closer look at each component:
Niacinamide
:
Niacinamide
, also known as vitamin B3, is a water-soluble vitamin that has been shown to have numerous skin benefits. It has anti-inflammatory properties that can help soothe and calm the skin, making it an excellent ingredient for people who have sensitive or acne-prone skin. Niacinamide can also help to smooth out enlarged pores, fine lines, and uneven skin tone. It has also been shown to help strengthen the skin barrier, which can help reduce moisture loss and improve overall skin health and appearance.
Mandelic acid
: Mandelic acid is an
alpha hydroxy acid (AHA)
found in bitter almonds. Because it has larger molecules than other AHAs, it penetrates the skin more slowly and gently, making it an excellent choice for those with sensitive skin. Mandelic acid has exfoliating properties that can aid in the removal of dead skin cells and the improvement of skin texture. It can also help to brighten the skin and reduce the visibility of hyperpigmentation and acne scars. Furthermore, mandelic acid has been shown to improve skin barrier function, which can help reduce moisture loss and improve overall skin health.
When using niacinamide and mandelic acid in your skincare routine, it's important to start with a low concentration of mandelic acid and to patch-test any new products before incorporating them into your routine. Additionally, be sure to follow the instructions for each product to ensure that you're using them in the correct order and getting the most benefit from each one.

Evaluating the Compatibility of Ingredients
Not all skincare ingredients are compatible with one another, and some combinations can even be harmful to the skin. Therefore, it is essential to take compatibility into account before incorporating an ingredient into your skincare routine.  Here are some things to consider when assessing ingredient compatibility:
pH levels
: Certain skincare ingredients work best at specific pH levels. For example, vitamin C works best at pH levels of 3.5 or lower, whereas AHAs such as mandelic acid work best at pH levels of 3 to 4. If you're using multiple products with varying pH levels, it's critical to use them in the correct order to ensure their effectiveness.
Concentrations
: In high concentrations, some skincare ingredients can be irritating to the skin. Using too much retinol, for example, can result in redness and peeling. To avoid overexposure to certain ingredients, it is critical to follow the recommended usage instructions for each product.
Layering
: Some skincare ingredients can be combined, while others must be used separately.
Vitamin C
and AHAs, for example, can be used together but should be applied at different times to avoid irritation. As a general rule, apply products with a thinner consistency first, followed by thicker products.
Sensitivity
: Certain ingredients may cause sensitivities or allergies in some people. To avoid any negative reactions, it's critical to patch-test any new products before incorporating them into your skincare routine.
You can develop an effective and safe skincare routine that addresses your specific skin concerns by considering the compatibility of ingredients and using them in the right order and concentrations.

You can include both mandelic acid and niacinamide in your skincare routine by using the following advice:
Utilise niacinamide in the morning
: Niacinamide, a stable ingredient, can be used in the morning to assist in reducing inflammation and defending the skin. It can be included in moisturisers or applied as a serum.
Use mandelic acid in the evening

Be patient
: It may take several weeks before you fully reap the rewards of a new ingredient, so be patient and consistent with your routine.
Monitor your skin
: Pay attention to how the new ingredient affects your skin's tone. Stop using the product right away if any redness, itching, or irritation appears.
The health of your skin won't be jeopardised by using these suggestions to introduce new ingredients to your skincare regimen safely and effectively.
