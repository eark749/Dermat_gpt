The Science Behind Caprylic Triglyceride
A mixture of fatty acids, primarily caprylic acid and glycerin, make up caprylic triglycerides. Coconut oil, palm kernel oil, and other plant-based oils naturally contain caprylic acid, a medium-chain fatty acid. It is a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT), a saturated fatty acid with eight carbon atoms. When caprylic acid is combined with glycerin, it forms caprylic triglyceride. Glycerin is a colourless, odourless, viscous liquid that is commonly used in skincare products for its hydrating and moisturizing properties.
The unique molecular structure of caprylic triglyceride makes it an excellent emollient and carrier oil. Its small molecular size allows it to easily penetrate the skin, where it is rapidly absorbed without leaving a greasy residue. This makes it an ideal ingredient for use in skincare products. Research has shown that caprylic triglyceride offers many benefits for the skin. It has been found to help improve skin hydration, protect the skin from environmental stressors, and reduce the appearance of
fine lines and wrinkles
. It has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, making it an excellent choice for people with sensitive skin.
In addition to its skincare benefits, caprylic triglyceride has also been found to have antimicrobial and antifungal properties. This makes it helpful for treating a variety of skin issues, such as
eczema
, fungal infections, and acne. Overall, caprylic triglyceride science is in favor of its use in skincare products. It is a valuable ingredient for enhancing the health and appearance of skin because of its distinctive molecular structure and advantageous attributes.
