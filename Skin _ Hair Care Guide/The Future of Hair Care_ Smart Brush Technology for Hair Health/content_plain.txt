Brushing Wet Hair
: Wet hair is more prone to breakage, so avoid brushing it right after washing.  Instead, gently detangle wet hair with a wide-tooth comb or your fingers, then use a brush once it is partially dry.
Protective Styling
: When styling your hair, choose protective styles that reduce tension and manipulation, such as loose braids, buns or ponytails.  Avoid tight hairstyles and elastic bands, which can cause breakage.
Use Heat Protectant
: Before using heat styling tools, always apply a heat protectant spray or
serum to your hair.
This helps to form a protective barrier against heat damage and lowers the likelihood of breakage and split ends.
Trim regularly
: Every 6-8 weeks, trim your hair to remove split ends and keep them from travelling up the shaft.  This helps to keep your hair healthy and reduces the likelihood of breakage.
Maintain a Healthy Diet
: Eat a well-balanced diet high in nutrients that promote hair health, such as vitamins A, C, E, and biotin.  Drinking plenty of water and staying hydrated also promotes hair strength and resilience.
