Reputable Brand
: Select goods from reputable companies that value transparency and high quality.  The sourcing, testing, and production procedures of reputable brands are frequently disclosed.
Ingredient List
: Check the product label for an ingredient list. The oil of ylang-ylang should be specified as an ingredient. Look for products that have a complete list of other components so you can be sure the formulation is appropriate for your skin type and issues.
Proper Dilution
: Ylang-Ylang oil should be diluted in carrier oils or with other skincare products. Look for goods that state how much Ylang-Ylang oil was included in the composition. Most skin types can tolerate a concentration of 1-2% Ylang-Ylang oil.
