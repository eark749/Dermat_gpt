<h3><b>Tracing the Origins of Horsetail Extract</b></h3>
<p><span>Horsetail plant, or Equisetum as it is named technically, is the source of horsetail extract, which is frequently used in herbal and beauty products. It is possible to trace the origins of this plant's traditional therapeutic use back to prehistoric times. Here is a quick summary of the history of horsetail extract, including its use in antiquity, taxonomic origins, geographic distribution, cultural relevance, present applications, harvesting and extraction methods, and legal and ethical issues.

<h3><b>Nutrient-Rich Profile: What Makes Horsetail Unique?</b></h3>
<p><span>Equisetum, or horsetail, is an unusual plant with a nutritional profile that distinguishes it from many other plants. Because of its distinctive makeup, particularly its high silica concentration, it is a valuable element in many products, including skincare and herbal medicines. Horsetail is special due to the silica (silicon dioxide), minerals, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, phenolic acids, saponins, vitamins, fatty acids, and bioflavonoids that make up its nutrient-rich profile.

<h3><b>Collagen Boost: A Pathway to Youthful Skin</b></h3>
<p><span>A vital protein in the human body, collagen is essential for maintaining healthy skin and a young appearance. Because collagen production gradually declines with age, wrinkles, fine lines, and sagging skin appear. However, there are a number of strategies to increase collagen production and get skin that looks younger:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Dietary Collagen</b><span>: Consuming collagen-rich foods or supplements can help provide your body with the building blocks it needs to produce collagen. Collagen peptides are supplements that are typically derived from animal sources. Foods such as bone broth, fish, chicken, and egg whites also contain collagen.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Vitamin C</b><span>: Vitamin C is required for the synthesis of collagen. It serves as a cofactor for the enzymes responsible for collagen production. Include vitamin C-rich foods like citrus fruits, strawberries, and bell peppers in your diet, or use <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-vitamin-c3-serum">topical vitamin C serums on your skin</a>.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Amino Acids</b><span>: Amino acids, particularly proline and lysine, are required for the formation of collagen. These can be obtained from protein-rich foods such as lean meats, dairy, and legumes.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydration</b><span>: Keeping hydrated is critical for healthy skin. Skin that is dehydrated is more prone to wrinkles and fine lines. Drink plenty of water to keep your skin moisturised and plump.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Topical Retinoids</b><span>: Retinoids, which are found in a variety of skincare products, are known for their collagen-boosting properties. They stimulate collagen synthesis, which can improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>UV Protection</b><span>: One of the most effective ways to prevent collagen breakdown is to protect your skin from the sun's harmful UV rays. To protect your skin from UV damage, always <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-sunprotect-sunscreen-spf-50">wear sunscreen with broad-spectrum protection</a>. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Antioxidants</b><span>: Antioxidants help to neutralise free radicals, which can cause collagen damage. Include antioxidant-rich foods like berries, dark leafy greens, and nuts in your diet. Use antioxidant-rich skincare products such as vitamin E and green tea extract.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skincare Products</b><span>: There are skincare products designed specifically to increase collagen production.  In your skincare routine, look for ingredients like peptides, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hyaluronic-skinbooster-serum">hyaluronic acid</a>, and growth factors.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Laser and light therapies</b><span>: Some cosmetic treatments, such as laser therapy and intense pulsed light (IPL), can stimulate collagen production and improve skin elasticity and texture.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Microneedling</b><span>: This minimally invasive procedure uses tiny needles to create controlled micro-injuries in the skin, triggering collagen production as the skin heals.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Lifestyle Choices</b><span>: Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, as they can accelerate collagen degradation. Maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating well and exercising regularly.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Adequate Sleep</b><span>: Adequate sleep is essential for skin repair and collagen production. To allow your skin to rejuvenate, aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
