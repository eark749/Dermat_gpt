Take a small amount of the isoparaffin-infused product, such as a moisturizer or serum, and dot it onto different areas of your face—cheeks, forehead, chin, and nose. Gently massage the product into your skin using upward and outward motions, ensuring even distribution.
If you have specific skin concerns, such as dry patches or
fine lines
, you can apply additional product to those areas and gently pat it in for extra hydration and nourishment.
Give the product some time to absorb fully into your skin before moving on to the next step in your skincare routine. This allows the isoparaffin to work its magic, locking in moisture and leaving your skin feeling soft and smooth.
Depending on your skincare needs, you can layer additional products on top of the isoparaffin-infused product. This might include treatments like serums, oils, or SPF during the day.
If you're using isoparaffin-infused products during the daytime, be sure to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher as the final step in your skincare routine. Sunscreen helps to protect your skin from harmful UV rays and prevent premature aging.
If you include isoparaffin-infused products in your overnight skincare routine, you can supplement with treatments such as retinoids or night creams to target specific conditions while you sleep.
To see the best results from isoparaffin-infused products, consistency is key. Use them regularly as part of your daily skincare routine to maintain hydrated, smooth, and healthy-looking skin over time.
