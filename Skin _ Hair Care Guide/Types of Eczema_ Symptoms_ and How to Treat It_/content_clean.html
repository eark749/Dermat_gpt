<p><span>If you're scratching your skin and it itches, you likely have eczema. Eczema is a skin condition that causes inflammation and redness. It can affect any part of the body but is most common on the face, neck, hands, and feet. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to treating eczema - it will vary based on the severity of the condition. Some treatments include topical applications like calming creams, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hydrasoothe-moisturiser">moisturisers</a>, emollients or oral medications, and phototherapy (using ultraviolet light). Eczema is a skin condition that can be treated in many ways, but topical eczema treatment requires a combination of several different approaches to get the best results. Internal and external treatments all aim towards management and severity reduction.</span></p>
<h2><b>Causes of eczema<br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="Causes of eczema" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_4_-_2023-12-06T135220.028_480x480.png?v=1701850962"/></div>
<p><span>Often, it is difficult to determine the cause of eczema, as a variety of factors can cause it. However, allergies and environmental factors are often at the root of eczema symptoms. If you're experiencing eczema symptoms, you must see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment. The following are some typical eczema causes and triggers: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Genetics</b><span>: The effectiveness of the skin's defence mechanism against allergens and irritants may be compromised by specific gene mutations. Certain gene mutations can affect the skin's ability to provide an effective barrier against irritants and allergens.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Immune dysfunction</b><span>: Eczema is associated with an overactive immune response. The immune system may overreact to certain triggers, resulting in inflammation and skin irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Environmental factors</b><span>: Exposure to irritants or allergens can cause or worsen eczema. A few examples of these triggers are dust mites, pet dander, pollen, detergents, wool and synthetic fabrics, and specific foods.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Dry skin</b><span>: A weakened skin barrier that is unable to efficiently retain moisture might aggravate or cause eczema symptoms.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Stress</b><span>: In some people, emotional stress can aggravate eczema symptoms or cause flare-ups.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Climate and weather changes</b><span>: Extreme temperatures, low humidity, sweating, and rapid changes in weather conditions can irritate the skin and exacerbate eczema symptoms.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Microbes and infections</b><span>: Eczema can be triggered or worsened by skin infections caused by specific bacteria, viruses, or fungi.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hormones</b><span>: Changes in hormone levels, particularly in women, can have an impact on eczema symptoms. Eczema symptoms, for example, may worsen during pregnancy or menstruation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Certain foods</b><span>: While food allergies do not cause eczema, they can cause or worsen symptoms in some people. Dairy products, eggs, nuts, seeds, wheat, and soy are all common trigger foods.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>

<div>
<p><span><img alt="The psychological impact of eczema" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/27_6d2234eb-75a7-4028-9d9f-0bead1c4a5d3_480x480.png?v=1702108292"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Eczema can have a significant psychological impact on people, negatively impacting their emotional well-being and quality of life. The persistent and visible nature of eczema symptoms can cause a variety of psychological difficulties, including:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Emotional distress</b><span>: Managing the itchiness, pain, and discomfort brought on by eczema can make people feel more stressed, frustrated, anxious, and powerless. Sleep quality can be impacted by persistent itching and discomfort, which can result in weariness and irritability.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Self-esteem and body image</b><span>: The face, hands, and neck are common areas of the body where eczema manifests itself. A negative body image and feelings of embarrassment and self-consciousness can result from visible rashes, redness, scaling, and inflammation. This may have an effect on confidence and self-worth, especially in social settings.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Social impact</b><span>: People who have eczema may shy away from public places, swimming pools, and activities that require baring their skin because they are uncomfortable or fearful of being judged. This social withdrawal can result in feelings of isolation and loneliness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Impact on daily life</b><span>: Managing eczema takes a significant amount of time and effort. Constant skincare routines, doctor visits, and trying new treatments can interfere with daily activities, affecting work, school, and personal relationships.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Depression</b><span>: The chronic nature of eczema and its impact on quality of life can lead to depression in some people.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Scratching cycle</b><span>: Eczema is characterised by itchiness. Continuous scratching can result in a "scratch-itch" cycle, in which scratching provides temporary relief but ultimately worsens the skin and causes more itching, perpetuating the cycle.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>The psychological impact of eczema must be addressed for holistic management. Here are some coping tactics for eczema's psychological effects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Seek emotional support from friends, family, or support groups to discuss your feelings and experiences. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Practice stress-reduction techniques like meditation, yoga, or mindfulness to manage stress and anxiety.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Consider getting counselling or going to therapy to learn coping strategies and techniques for dealing with the emotional effects of eczema.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Participate in activities that will boost your self-esteem and confidence.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Maintain a consistent skincare routine and treatment plan to effectively manage symptoms.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Educate others about eczema to dispel myths and foster understanding and support.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Consultation with healthcare professionals, such as dermatologists and mental health specialists, can provide guidance, support, and treatment options for managing both the physical symptoms and the psychological impact of eczema.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span><img alt="The role of diet in eczema management" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/6_f222a02c-e98c-418c-8e3a-918c989ca150_480x480.png?v=1702103300"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Dietary factors in eczema management can differ from person to person. While nutrition is not the only cause of eczema, certain foods can induce or worsen flare-ups in some people. Identifying and avoiding certain trigger foods can aid in the management of eczema symptoms. It is crucial to highlight, however, that dietary adjustments should be undertaken with caution and under the supervision of a healthcare practitioner. Here's how a diet can help with eczema:</span></p>
<p><b>Potential Triggers</b><span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Food allergies</b><span>: Some people with eczema may have food allergies, which can aggravate their symptoms. Cow's milk, eggs, nuts, soy, wheat, and shellfish are all common allergens.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Food sensitivities</b><span>: Even in the absence of an allergy, certain foods can cause eczema flare-ups or worsen symptoms in sensitive people. These trigger foods can differ greatly between people.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Processed foods and additives</b><span>: Some people may develop eczema as a result of preservatives, artificial colors, and certain additives found in processed foods.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<b>Dietary Management Strategies</b><span>:</span>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Maintain a food diary</b><span>: Tracking your diet and eczema symptoms can assist in identifying any potential links between certain foods and flare-ups.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Elimination diet:</b><span> Under the supervision of a healthcare professional, eliminating suspected trigger foods for some time and gradually reintroducing them one at a time can help pinpoint specific triggers.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Healthy diet</b><span>: Emphasise a balanced and nutritious diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts may have anti-inflammatory properties that help some people with eczema.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Stay hydrated</b><span>: Drinking plenty of water can help keep your skin hydrated from within.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<b>Things to Consider</b><span>:</span>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Individual differences: Trigger foods can vary greatly from person to person. </b><span>What one person experiences may not be felt by another. </span></p>

<p><span>Understanding and avoiding eczema triggers is critical for controlling the condition and avoiding flare-ups. Eczema causes differ from person to person, but several common circumstances may aggravate symptoms. Here's how to spot and avoid these red flags:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Irritants</b><span>: Irritating substances on the skin might cause eczema flare-ups. Soaps, detergents, fragrances, and harsh chemicals found in cleaning goods are examples of these. <br/></span><b>Avoidance</b><span>: Use mild, fragrance-free soaps and detergents. When using cleaning products, wear gloves and attempt to limit your exposure to harsh chemicals.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Allergens:</b><span> Allergens can exacerbate eczema symptoms. Pollen, pet dander, dust mites, mould, and some foods are examples. <br/></span><b>Avoidance</b><span>: Determine and restrict your exposure to recognised allergies. To reduce indoor allergies, use allergen-proof bedding, howover, and dust regularly, and consider air purifiers. Work with a healthcare expert to identify and treat specific food allergies or sensitivities when it comes to food triggers.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Fabrics and Clothing</b><span>: Rough or irritating fabrics can irritate the skin and cause flare-ups of eczema. <br/></span><b>Avoidance</b><span>: Choose soft, breathable fabrics such as cotton over scratchy materials such as wool. Wash new clothes before wearing them to remove any potential irritants.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Temperature and Humidity</b><span>: High or low humidity, as well as extreme temperatures, can aggravate eczema. <br/></span><b>Avoidance</b><span>: Keep your room at a comfortable temperature and use a humidifier in dry weather to keep your skin from drying out. In hot weather, dress in loose, breathable clothing to prevent sweating.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Stress</b><span>: Stress on an emotional level can exacerbate pre-existing symptoms of eczema or cause flare-ups. <br/></span><b>Avoidance</b><span>: Take up stress-relieving exercises like yoga, meditation, and mindfulness, or meditation, or take up relaxing pastimes and pursuits.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Scratching</b><span>: Frequent scratching can aggravate the skin even more and cause a flare-up. <br/></span><b>Avoidance</b><span>: To lessen the impulse to scratch, cut your nails short, cover itchy spots with soft cloths, and use diversionary tactics.</span></p>
