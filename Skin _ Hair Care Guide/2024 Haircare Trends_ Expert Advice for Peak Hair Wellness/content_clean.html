</li>
<li>
<p><b>Herbal Supplements and Teas</b><span>: Certain herbs, such as rosemary, horsetail, and nettle, are thought to improve hair health. <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-growth-supplements">Herbal supplements </a>or teas containing these ingredients can support hair growth.</span></p>
</li>
