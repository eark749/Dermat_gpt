Are you shedding huge patches of hair each day? Do you notice your hair becoming thinner lately? Well, you are not alone. Alopecia or other forms of hair loss in women are worrisome issues - but dermatological and science-backed remedies can help you prevent them in time.
Women's hair loss can be upsetting, but there are some expert-crafted ways to help prevent or reduce it. Remember that the cause of hair loss varies from person to person, so speak with a healthcare practitioner or
dermatologist
for a personalised strategy. This blog discusses some general considerations.
Sudden hair loss in women: It's not a myth!
Contrary to what most people think, increased hair fall in women often goes unannounced. It can be a side effect of a medicine, a result of your pregnancy, or simply a sign of aging. Whatever the causes of hair loss in women, they require your attention. Hair loss in women is less prevalent than in men, yet it may be just as damaging and upsetting. Here are some of the most common causes of female hair loss:
Telogen Effluvium
: The onset of this syndrome is frequently caused by a significant physiological or emotional stressor, such as childbirth, surgery, severe illness, or a traumatic incident. Hair follicles enter the resting (telogen) phase early, resulting in visible hair loss months later.
Androgenetic Alopecia
: Also known as female pattern hair loss, this genetic condition can cause gradual
hair thinning and loss
, but it can also accelerate, resulting in abrupt hair loss.
Hormonal Changes
: Hormonal fluctuations caused by pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, or discontinuing or restarting birth control can disrupt hair growth cycles, resulting in temporary or sudden hair loss.
Thyroid Disorders
: Hair loss can be a symptom of both hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).
Medications
: As a side effect, certain medications, such as those used to treat cancer, high blood pressure, depression, or arthritis, can cause hair loss.
Autoimmune Conditions
: Alopecia areata, a condition in which the immune system attacks hair follicles, can cause sudden and patchy hair loss.
Nutritional Deficiencies
: Hair loss can be caused by a lack of essential nutrients, particularly iron, biotin, and zinc.
Fungal Infections
: If left untreated, scalp infections like ringworm can cause hair loss.
Trichotillomania
: This is a psychological condition in which people repeatedly pull out their hair, resulting in noticeable hair loss.
Excessive Hairstyling or Treatments
: Excessive use of hair dyes, chemical treatments, or hairstyling practises that stress the hair can result in unexpected hair loss.
If you're suffering abrupt hair loss, you should see a doctor or a dermatologist to find out what's causing it. A correct diagnosis is required for the development of an effective treatment strategy, which may include lifestyle changes, drugs, or other treatments. Remember that early intervention frequently results in the best possibilities for hair regeneration or stabilisation. Addressing any underlying health issues, decreasing stress, and eating a nutritious diet will all help with hair health and regeneration.
How to prevent hair loss in women: 5 useful tricks
Preventing female hair loss requires a combination of healthy practises to preserve scalp and hair health. Here are five important hair loss prevention tips:
Tips for hair fall control in women
How to follow it
Exercise & yoga
Set a routine for jogging and neck exercises to control hair fall. Yoga postures like Balasana and Sirsasana also set your hormones right.
Styling products
Avoid using chemical-rich styling products that damage your hair. Reduce your hair treatments, including perming and
hair coloring
that weaken your strands.
Hairstyles
Always tie your hair loosely without putting pressure on the roots. Tight ponytails often increase hair fall. Additionally, don’t let your hair stay open for long, as it degrades the quality due to pollution.
Regular oiling
Make a regular schedule to use
hair oils
weekly. It is one of the most effective home remedies for hair fall because it nourishes your hair and strengthens the strands from the core.
Iron-rich diet
A deficiency of iron can cause sudden hair loss in women. Include iron-rich foods in your daily diet, like spinach and carrots.
Say NO to hot showers
Hot water dries the hair strands, making them brittle and increasing the chances of breakage. Use lukewarm water to keep the scalp’s natural oils intact.
Aside from these suggestions, it is important to maintain overall health and address any underlying medical concerns that may be contributing to hair loss. If you're experiencing considerable or persistent hair loss, speak with a healthcare professional or dermatologist for a proper evaluation and customised treatment recommendations. Keep in mind that genetics can also play a part in hair loss in some women. While it is not always possible to avoid hereditary hair loss, the measures listed above can help maintain the health of your existing hair and possibly reduce the pace of hair loss.
Are females at a greater risk for hair fall?
The short answer is yes! Females deal with a spectrum of hormones - precisely at the age when the progression of sudden hair loss in women starts. Different phases of life, including menstruation, childbirth, and menopause, put women at a greater risk for hair fall - so it's vital to know the reasons for hair loss in women.
Hair loss can affect both men and women, although the patterns and causes differ across the sexes. Females are not at a higher risk for hair loss in general, but they may experience hair loss for various reasons and in different patterns than males. The most common type of hair loss in men is androgenetic alopecia, also known as male pattern
baldness
. The primary causes of this condition are hormones and genetics. The condition typically presents as thinning of the crown and receding hairline. Female pattern hair loss, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is the most common type of hair loss in women. It usually manifests as diffuse thinning across the top of the scalp rather than a receding hairline and is brought on by hormones and genetics.
Stress, nutritional deficiencies, medical conditions, medications, and lifestyle choices are all factors that can cause hair loss in both men and women. In some cases, women may experience temporary hair loss due to factors such as pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, or hormonal imbalances.
What are the common triggers for hair fall in women?
There can be multiple reasons for hair loss in women, which leads to sudden baldness. All these causes result in loosening hair strands, increasing your hair fall gradually. Here are the top 5 reasons behind hair loss in women:
Poor diet and lifestyle
: Your hair extracts nutrients from the food you eat throughout the day. Make sure to consume a high-protein diet that helps strengthen your hair strands from the roots. Tying your hair in tight ponytails can also lead to increased hair fall.
Genetic pattern baldness
: If you have a family history of hair fall and have pattern baldness, sudden bald patches are likely to affect you. This can be a hereditary issue and requires medical consultation to get long-term relief.
Increased stress
: Both physical and mental stress can lead to hair loss in women. You will likely experience sudden hair fall while going through a rough patch in life. Emotional stress and burnout also aggravate the situation. Overpowering emotions, including anger and sadness, can significantly impact your hair loss issue. They are known to be an indirect cause of stress that drains you mentally.
Aging & hormonal imbalance
: Hormones are primarily responsible for sudden hair loss in women. An imbalance in vital body functions causes the hormones to react differently. Aging also impacts these hormones and makes your hair grow thinner, leading to hair fall.
Medical side-effects
: You can have bald patches on your head if you suffer from severe ailments. Alternatively, therapies like chemo also increase hair loss. Some medications also lead to side effects that affect your hair strength.
If you're experiencing hair loss, it's critical to contact a healthcare expert or dermatologist, who can assist in establishing the underlying cause and making suitable treatment recommendations. Managing and avoiding more hair loss requires addressing the individual triggers.
#1 Take vitamins for hair loss in women
According to studies, close to 90% of your total hair follicles are in the anagen phase and require vital elements like minerals and proteins. Including vitamins in daily diets is highly crucial to preventing hair loss in women. Vitamins are micronutrients that are exceptional at enhancing your cellular turnover and preventing the risk of possible baldness. They are one of the most efficient ways to
treat hair fall in women.
Vitamins for hair loss in women can be consumed orally or applied to the scalp using certain mixtures. However, supplements taken orally tend to have a faster impact by regulating your hormone levels. You can purchase best-in-class supplements for
hair growth
on Clinikally. The dermatologists at Clinikally have carefully selected each of these
hair growth supplements
based on their efficacy and safety.
Here are some vitamins and minerals that are frequently linked to hair health:
Biotin (Vitamin H)
: Biotin is frequently recommended for
promoting healthy hair growth
. It is involved in the production of keratin, a protein that makes up your hair. Biotin supplements may be beneficial if you have a biotin deficiency, which is uncommon.
Iron
: Iron is essential for healthy hair growth, and a lack of it can result in hair thinning and loss. If you have iron deficiency anaemia, your doctor may advise you to take iron supplements.
Vitamin D
: Vitamin D is essential for overall health, and a lack of it has been linked to hair loss. Adequate exposure to sunlight and a diet rich in vitamin D sources can help maintain proper levels.
Vitamin E
: Vitamin E is an antioxidant that can help improve blood circulation to the scalp, thereby promoting hair growth.
Zinc
: Zinc is essential for hair health, and a deficiency may contribute to hair loss.  If you have a zinc deficit, zinc supplements may be prescribed.
Vitamin A
: Vitamin A helps to produce sebum, the oily material that moisturises the scalp. However, too much vitamin A can be dangerous, so it's critical to keep a healthy balance.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
: These good fats, which can be found in foods like fatty fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts, can help keep the scalp healthy and encourage hair development.
It is important to speak with a healthcare practitioner or dermatologist before using any hair loss supplements. They may examine your specific requirements, establish if you are deficient, and offer appropriate vitamins and amounts. It's also critical to eat a healthy diet and address any underlying medical concerns that may be causing your hair loss. Supplements should be viewed as an addition to a healthy lifestyle and a comprehensive approach to hair care.
#2 Use aloe vera to leverage the power of nature
Aloe vera is one of the most traditional and best-known treatments to prevent hair fall while treating it - you might have heard of it at home while growing up!
Aloe vera is one of the most traditional treatments to prevent hair fall while treating itching and
dandruff
. It contains multiple active ingredients that penetrate into your hair roots and strengthen them from the core. Be it the juice or extracted pulp, both the aloe vera-containing elements provide the required nourishment to your scalp and treat your greasy hair. The ancient plant aloe vera contains fatty acids, amino acids, and vitamins A, C, and E. All of these factors encourage complete cell turnover, resulting in healthy, lustrous hair growth. It also contains Vitamin B12 and Folic acid, which help strengthen your hair strands. Because of their specific enzymes, proteolytic enzymes can readily perform this efficient task.
How to use aloe vera for hair fall:
Extract the pulp from an aloe vera leaf.
Massage gently and thoroughly with your fingertips on your hair and scalp.
Let it stay for about 45 minutes.
Rinse properly with normal or room-temperature water.
For best results, repeat this process 2-3 times a week.
Alternatively, you can drink aloe vera juice at least 3 to 4 times a week.
When putting aloe vera on your hair, make sure it's pure aloe vera gel or juice with no added chemicals or preservatives. Before using aloe vera on your scalp or hair, perform a patch test if you have sensitive skin or allergies. Furthermore, while aloe vera can be beneficial to many people, the outcomes vary from person to person, so it may not work for everyone. If you have specific hair difficulties, seek personalised advice and treatment options from a dermatologist or a healthcare professional.
#3 Make an egg hair mask at home
Another way to harness the power of vitamins and micronutrients is through eggs! Eggs are filled with vital proteins, including B-complex vitamins and some essential minerals. Applying it as a
hair mask
will stimulate your scalp and provide adequate nutrition to your hair follicles, thus preventing hair fall. Using an egg mask for hair will help you enjoy long, smooth, and volume-full hair. Being rich in zinc, sulfur, and phosphorus, it strengthens hair roots, thus boosting hair growth and preventing split ends in women.
You can easily make an egg hair mask at home instead of applying raw eggs to your hair to reduce the odor caused by egg content. It will make your new hair stronger and less prone to various breakage and extensive shedding
How to apply egg hair mask:
Take a bowl and crack an egg in it.
Mix it with a teaspoon of honey and olive oil.
Pick up a brush to apply this mixture from the roots to the tip of your hair strands.
Wait for around 25 minutes and wash it in cold water using a mild shampoo.
#4 Use only dermatologist-recommended haircare products
Using
hair care
products at random puts your hair loss issue at greater risk. They can cause further damage to your strands and weaken the roots permanently. Thus, it is essential to opt for dermatologist-recommended hair fall products that are reliable and safe to use on your scalp. Various serums,
shampoos
, and oils come with effective formulations that restore the strength of your hair.
Using reliable haircare products is the best hair loss treatment for women when done right. They directly treat your troubled areas by resolving the core issues and providing shiny hair for a long time. When you buy dermatologist-curated haircare products on Clinikally, you can rest assured about their side effects, safety, and efficacy - and enjoy free home delivery of products.
Here are some recommendations for dermatologist-recommended hair care products:
Consult a Dermatologist
: If you have specific hair or scalp issues, see a dermatologist. They can assess your condition, make a diagnosis, and recommend products that are tailored to your specific needs.
Examine Product Labels
: Examine the labels of hair care products to look for key ingredients and potential allergens. Dermatologist-recommended products frequently contain milder, hypoallergenic ingredients.
Avoid Harsh Ingredients
: Avoid hair care products containing harsh chemicals, sulphates, parabens, and synthetic fragrances, as these can irritate your scalp and cause hair problems.
Choose Products for Your Hair Type
: Choose items that are appropriate for your hair type (for example, dry, oily, fine, or curly). Dermatologist-recommended products are frequently classified according to hair type, making it easier to locate the perfect match.
Address Scalp Concerns
: If you suffer from dandruff,
seborrheic dermatitis
, or other scalp disorders, look for products that address these difficulties. Shampoos and treatments advised by dermatologists can be beneficial in treating scalp issues.
Be Consistent
: Follow the instructions on the product labels and those supplied by your dermatologist. Consistency is essential for getting the best results from your hair care practise.
Patch Test
: It's a good idea to run a patch test before using a new product to ensure you don't have an allergic reaction. Apply a small amount of the product to an inconspicuous region of your skin and keep an eye out for any signs of irritation.
Monitor Results
: Keep track of how the products you've been recommended are performing for your hair and scalp. Consult your dermatologist if you experience any side effects or do not see any improvement.
Remember that what works for one person may not work for another because hair and scalp types vary greatly. Dermatologist-recommended products are a good place to start, but personal preferences, allergies, and sensitivities should also be considered. Always consult with your dermatologist about any ongoing hair care issues to ensure you're utilising the best products for your unique needs.
#5 Consult a dermatologist for expert advice
Increased hair loss can be a severe issue and sometimes requires medical intervention. Choosing hair care products without proper knowledge of their ingredients can damage your hair permanently. At such times, it is best to consult an experienced dermatologist to find out the exact cause behind your hair fall. You can consult dermatologists online and get a hair treatment plan that's designed to reduce hair fall and prevent hair loss in women!
Dermatologists are trained medical professionals that specialise in the diagnosis and treatment of skin, hair, and nail problems. Skin conditions, hair loss, scalp conditions, skin cancer screenings, cosmetic concerns, allergies and sensitivities, customised skincare regimens, chronic skin conditions, preventive counsel, and expert advice are all reasons to consult a dermatologist. When you visit a dermatologist, they will perform a comprehensive examination, offer suitable treatments, and provide continued care and follow-up as needed. Whether you have a specific concern or just wish to improve the health of your skin or hair, the experience of a dermatologist may help you achieve your goals while providing the greatest care for your skin and hair.
Use science to get long healthy hair!
Growing long, healthy hair is a process that requires both appropriate hair care practises and a grasp of hair growth science. Here are some scientifically proven hair care tips to help you attain long, healthy hair:
Proper Nutrition
: Hair is made up of a protein called keratin, so eating a protein-rich diet is crucial. Additionally, make sure you receive enough vitamins (particularly B vitamins), minerals (iron and zinc), and omega-3 fatty acids, all of which are important for hair health.
Scalp Health
: Healthy hair begins with a healthy scalp. Use a gentle, pH-balanced shampoo and
conditioner
to keep your scalp clean and balanced. Scalp massages can increase blood circulation and promote hair growth.
Hair Growth Cycle
: Understanding the hair growth cycle is critical. Hair grows, rests, and sheds in a continuous cycle. At any given time, the majority of your hair is in the growth phase (anagen).  Increasing the amount of time your hair spends in the growing phase can help it grow longer.
Avoid Hair Damage
: Avoid damaging your hair by avoiding practises such as excessive heat styling, chemical treatments, and tight hairstyles. Heat and chemicals can cause the hair shaft to weaken, resulting in breakage and split ends.
Trim on a regular basis
: Although it may seem counterintuitive, getting regular trims (every 8-12 weeks) can help maintain the health of your hair by preventing split ends from traveling up the hair shaft.
Sun and UV Ray Protection
: Just like your skin,
sun exposure
can damage your hair.  When in direct sunlight, use UV-protective hair products or wear a hat to protect your hair.
Be patient
: Hair grows at a rate of about half an inch (1.25 cm) per month on average. It may take some time to achieve the desired length, so patience is essential.
Avoid Stress: Chronic stress can lead to hair loss.
Try stress-reduction techniques such as meditation, yoga, and exercise to keep your stress levels in check.
Proper Hydration
: Staying hydrated is essential for overall health, including the health of your hair. Dehydration can cause brittle hair, so drink plenty of water every day.
Consult a Dermatologist
: If you have significant hair loss or are concerned about the health of your hair, see a dermatologist.  They can offer personalised advice and, if necessary, recommend treatments.
Remember that genetics influence how long and thick your hair can grow. While these scientifically proven hair growth strategies can help, your genetic predisposition determines the potential length and thickness of your hair.
Nutrition and Diet: Key to Healthy Hair
Nutrition and diet play a crucial role in maintaining healthy hair. The foods you eat have an impact on the health of your hair because they provide essential nutrients that promote hair growth, strength, and overall appearance. Here are key nutrients and dietary tips to promote healthy hair:
Protein
: Keratin, a protein, is the main component of hair. Protein from sources such as lean meats, chicken, fish, eggs, dairy, and plant-based choices (legumes, nuts, seeds, and tofu) is needed for good hair.
Vitamins and Minerals
: Biotin is a B vitamin that is found in foods such as eggs, almonds, and sweet potatoes. This vitamin aids the body's absorption of iron, which is essential for hair health. Citrus fruits, strawberries, and bell peppers are high in
vitamin C
. Iron deficiency can result in hair loss. Iron-rich foods such as red meat, chicken, beans, lentils, spinach, and fortified cereals should be included. Zinc, which is present in foods such as nuts, whole grains, and dairy products, aids in hair health. These beneficial fats, found in fatty fish (salmon, mackerel), flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts, can help keep your scalp and hair healthy.
Collagen
:
Collagen
is a protein that helps in the maintenance of hair strength and suppleness. Bone broth, collagen supplements, and collagen-rich foods like chicken skin and fish skin can all help collagen production.
Hydration
: Keeping hydrated is essential for maintaining hair health. Dehydration can cause dry, brittle hair.
Balanced Diet
: Aim for a well-balanced diet that contains a variety of nutrients. A variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats will provide your body with the vitamins and minerals it requires.
Avoid Excess Sugar and Processed Foods
: A high-sugar and processed-food diet can cause inflammation and have a negative impact on hair health.
Excessive Alcohol and Caffeine Consumption
: Excessive alcohol and caffeine consumption can dehydrate your body, affecting the health of your hair.
Food Allergies
: If you suspect that you have food allergies or sensitivities that are affecting your hair, consult a healthcare professional for testing and dietary advice.
Supplements
: If you have dietary restrictions or specific hair concerns, talk to your doctor about whether supplements are necessary. Deficits may necessitate the recommendation of iron, biotin, and other supplements.
Balanced Calorie Intake
: Hair loss and nutrient deficiencies can arise from strict diets and calorie restriction. Make sure you are getting in the right amount of calories to meet your body's demands.
Because hair grows slowly, keep in mind that it will take some time for dietary changes to noticeably affect your hair. If you are worried about the condition of your hair, you should speak with a qualified dietitian or healthcare provider who can offer you individualised advice and suggestions based on your unique requirements.
Essential vitamins and minerals for hair health
Several vitamins and minerals are important in promoting healthy hair. These nutrients are necessary for hair development, strength, and overall health. The following are some of the most important vitamins and minerals for maintaining healthy hair:
Biotin (Vitamin H)
: Biotin is essential for healthy hair growth and can aid in the strengthening of the hair shaft. It can be found in foods such as eggs, nuts, sweet potatoes, and whole grains.
Vitamin A
: Vitamin A is required for the production of sebum, the natural oil that keeps the scalp and hair moist. Sweet potatoes, carrots, spinach, and kale are all good sources of vitamin A.
Vitamin C
: Vitamin C is an antioxidant that aids the body's absorption of iron, which is essential for hair health.  Vitamin C is abundant in citrus fruits, strawberries, and bell peppers.
Vitamin D
: Vitamin D plays a role in hair follicle cycling and can help with hair growth. When the skin is exposed to sunshine, the body can synthesise it. Fatty fish and fortified foods are good sources.
Vitamin E
: Vitamin E is an antioxidant that promotes hair development by increasing blood circulation to the scalp. Vitamin E can be found in nuts, seeds, and spinach.
Iron
: Hair loss may result from an iron deficiency. Include foods high in iron, such as poultry, red meat, beans, lentils, spinach, and fortified cereals, in your diet.
Zinc
: Zinc is essential for maintaining healthy hair and preventing
hair loss
. Dairy products, whole grains, and nuts are foods high in zinc.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
: Rich in fatty fish (mackerel, salmon), flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts, omega-3 fatty acids can support healthy hair development and scalp health.
Vitamin B3 (niacin)
: Niacin stimulates blood flow to the scalp, promoting the growth of hair. Fish, whole grains, and poultry are good sources of it.
B vitamins
: A number of B vitamins are necessary for normal hair growth and general health, including B6 (pyridoxine), B12 (cobalamin), and B5 (pantothenic acid).  Many different foods, such as meats, fish, poultry, dairy products, and whole grains, contain these vitamins.
Copper
: Copper is involved in the production of melanin, the
pigment
that gives hair its color. It is present in foods such as shellfish, organ meats, and whole grains.
Selenium
: Selenium is an essential mineral that promotes hair health and can be obtained from foods such as Brazil nuts, whole grains, and seafood.
Silica
: Silica aids in the formation of collagen, which is an important component of healthy hair. It can be found in foods such as oats, brown rice, and whole wheat bread.
Including a variety of these vitamins and minerals in your diet can promote healthy hair growth and overall hair health. If you are concerned about the health of your hair, seek personalised advice from a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian.
Foods to include in your diet
A well-balanced diet rich in nutrient-rich foods is crucial for general health and can benefit hair health as well. Consider including lean proteins, iron-rich foods, omega-3 fatty acids, biotin sources, vitamin C-rich foods, vitamin A sources, vitamin e-rich foods, dairy or dairy alternatives, whole grains, zinc sources, antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables, and water and collagen-rich foods in your diet to support healthy hair. It's critical to seek personalised nutritional guidance from a healthcare expert or a qualified dietitian, especially if you have certain dietary limitations or health problems. A well-balanced diet, combined with adequate hair care, can help to maintain healthy and colorful hair.
