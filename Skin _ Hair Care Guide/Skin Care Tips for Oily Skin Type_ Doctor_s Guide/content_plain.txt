One of the most common skin problems is oily skin. It has some distinct challenges, such as a shiny complexion and acne breakouts. What's the good news? These issues can be mitigated with the proper skincare routine and products.
We turned to a couple of skincare experts to help us figure out how to care for an oily complexion. We specifically asked them to share their top tips for developing an oily skin daily skincare routine. As a result, you now have a simple four-step routine to keep your skin healthy, clear, and shine-free in the morning and evening.
What Causes Oily Skin
Oily skin is caused by an overproduction of sebum, which is the natural oil produced by the sebaceous glands in the skin. Sebum is necessary to keep the skin healthy and hydrated, but when too much is produced, it can cause the skin to appear shiny and feel greasy. There are a number of factors that can contribute to the overproduction of sebum and the development of oily skin, including:
Genetics
: Oily skin can be inherited, so if other members of your family have oily skin, you are more likely to have it too.
Hormones
: Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during puberty or
pregnancy
, can cause an increase in sebum production.
Diet
: Consuming a diet high in fat and refined carbohydrates can also contribute to oily skin.
Stress
: Stress can trigger the production of hormones that stimulate sebum production.
Environmental factors
: Humidity, heat, and pollution can all cause the skin to produce more sebum.
Skincare products
: Using skincare products that are too harsh or that strip the skin of its natural oils can cause the skin to overcompensate and produce more sebum.
If you have oily skin, it's important to use skincare products that are designed to balance and regulate oil production. A gentle cleanser, a lightweight moisturizer, and a non-comedogenic sunscreen can all help to keep oily skin under control.
Do I have an oily skin type?
There are a few factors that can help you determine whether you have an oily skin type:
Shine
: If your skin looks shiny or greasy, especially on the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin), it's likely that you have an oily skin type.
Pores
: Oily skin tends to have larger pores, which can often become
clogged
and lead to breakouts.
Breakouts
: If you experience frequent acne breakouts, particularly in the T-zone, it may be an indication of oily skin.
Touch
: If your skin feels slick to the touch, it's likely that you have an oily skin type.
If you're still unsure about your skin type, it's always a good idea to consult with a dermatologist or skincare professional who can help you determine your skin type and recommend the best skincare routine for you.
Hormonal Changes and Oily Skin
Hormonal changes can have a significant effect on the skin, especially in people who have oily skin. Here's how hormonal changes can influence oily skin:
Hormonal changes, particularly during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, can cause the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum (skin oil). Excess oil can cause oily skin and exacerbate acne and enlarged pores.
Excess sebum can combine with dead skin cells and bacteria, resulting in clogged pores and acne breakouts. Hormonal changes, such as fluctuations in androgen levels (e.g., testosterone), can aggravate acne by increasing sebum production and inflammation.
Many people notice changes in their skin during various stages of their menstrual cycle. Hormonal shifts in the days leading up to menstruation (the luteal phase) can cause an increase in oil production, resulting in oilier skin and possibly acne flare-ups.
Hormonal changes, particularly elevated levels of oestrogen and progesterone, can disrupt the skin's oil balance. Some individuals experience an increase in oil production, leading to oily skin and acne, while others may notice their skin becomes drier.
As estrogen levels decline during menopause, the skin can become drier. However, some individuals may still experience oily skin due to fluctuations in other hormones, such as testosterone. This can contribute to adult acne or exacerbate existing oily skin issues.
Diet and Its Relation to Oily Skin
Diet can influence oily skin, but the impact varies from person to person. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, certain dietary factors may affect oil production and skin health:
Fatty Foods
: A diet high in unhealthy fats, such as saturated and trans fats found in fried foods, processed snacks, and fatty meats, can lead to oily skin. These fats can cause the sebaceous glands to produce additional oil.
High-Glycemic Foods
: High-glycemic foods, such as sugary snacks, white bread, and processed cereals, can cause blood sugar spikes. Elevated blood sugar levels can cause hormonal fluctuations that increase sebum production, potentially worsening oily skin and acne.
Dairy Products
: Some studies suggest that dairy consumption, particularly milk, may aggravate acne in some people. Dairy products contain hormones and growth factors that could influence oil production and skin inflammation. However, more research is needed to fully understand the link between dairy and oily skin.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
: Omega-3 fatty acid-rich foods include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, and sardines), flaxseeds, and walnuts, which have anti-inflammatory properties and may help balance oil production in the skin. Including these foods in your diet may result in healthier skin overall.
Antioxidant-Rich Foods
: A diet high in antioxidants, such as fruits, vegetables, and green tea, can help protect the skin against oxidative stress and inflammation. Antioxidants may also benefit skin health by regulating oil production.
Water Intake
: Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water is essential for good skin health. Dehydration can cause the skin to produce more oil to compensate for moisture loss, which can exacerbate oily skin.
Spicy foods and alcohol
: Some people believe that eating spicy foods or drinking alcohol temporarily increases blood flow to the skin, causing a flushed appearance and possibly stimulating oil production.
Individual Sensitivities
: Some people are sensitive to certain foods, such as chocolate, nuts, or shellfish, which can cause acne breakouts or worsen oily skin. Identifying and avoiding trigger foods may help manage skin concerns.
While dietary changes may have an impact on oily skin, it's important to approach them as part of a comprehensive skincare routine that includes proper cleansing, hydration, and topical treatments. Furthermore, everyone's skin is different, so what works for one may not work for another. If you're worried about oily skin or acne, see a dermatologist for personalised advice and treatment options.
Treatments for Oily Skin Type
If you have oily skin, there are several treatments and strategies you can try to help reduce oiliness and keep your skin looking healthy. Here are a few suggestions:
Use a gentle cleanser
: Look for a gentle, oil-free
cleanser
that won't strip your skin of its natural oils, which can actually cause it to produce more oil. Use it twice a day to keep your skin clean and refreshed.
Try a toner
: A toner can help remove excess oil and unclog pores. Look for a toner that contains ingredients like salicylic acid or witch hazel, which can help regulate oil production.
Use a mattifying moisturizer
: A moisturizer that is designed for oily skin can help keep your skin hydrated without adding excess oil. Look for a lightweight, oil-free formula that contains ingredients like
hyaluronic acid
or glycerin.
Use blotting papers
: Blotting papers can help remove excess oil throughout the day without stripping your skin of its natural oils. Keep a pack in your purse or bag for easy touch-ups.
Use a clay mask
: A clay mask can help absorb excess oil and unclog pores. Look for a clay mask that contains ingredients like kaolin or bentonite clay.
Avoid harsh products
: Harsh products like alcohol-based toners or exfoliants can actually make oily skin worse. Avoid products that contain harsh ingredients like alcohol or fragrances.
Consider seeing a dermatologist
: If your oily skin is causing acne or other skin issues, a
dermatologist
can help you
find the right treatment plan. They may recommend prescription-strength products or other treatments like chemical peels or laser therapy.
Professional Dermatological Treatments
Professional dermatological treatments can help manage oily skin and associated issues like acne, enlarged pores, and excessive shine. Here are some common treatments offered by dermatologists:
Chemical Peels
: Chemical peels involve applying a chemical solution to the skin to exfoliate the top layers, which promotes cell turnover and results in smoother, clearer skin. Peels with ingredients like salicylic acid or glycolic acid can help reduce oiliness, unclog pores, and treat acne.
Microdermabrasion
: Microdermabrasion employs a handheld device to gently exfoliate the skin's surface, removing dead skin cells and excess oil. It can help improve the appearance of oily skin, shrink pores, and reduce acne scars and hyperpigmentation.
Laser Therapy
: Laser treatments, such as fractional laser therapy or intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy, target the sebaceous glands, reducing oil production. They can also improve skin texture, reduce pore size, and alleviate acne inflammation.
Microneedling
: Microneedling is a technique that uses a device with fine needles to create micro-injuries in the skin, which stimulate collagen production and improve skin texture. It can help to reduce oiliness, refine pores, and improve acne scars.
Photodynamic therapy (PDT)
: PDT targets oil glands and acne-causing bacteria by combining light therapy with a photosensitizing agent, usually a topical medication. It can lessen acne lesions, cut down on oil production, and enhance the general tone and texture of the skin.
Extraction
: To free trapped sebum and debris from the pores, dermatologists may manually extract comedones, also known as blackheads and whiteheads. This can lessen the likelihood of acne flare-ups and enhance the appearance of oily skin.
Medications on Prescription
: To treat acne and oily skin, dermatologists may recommend oral or topical medications. For severe cases of acne, oral medications like isotretinoin or oral contraceptives may be advised in addition to topical treatments like retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, or topical antibiotics.
Treatments for the Face
: Expert facials designed specifically for oily skin can help clear pores, eliminate extra oil, and enhance the texture of the skin. Steam, extractions, exfoliation, and mask applications customised to target particular skin concerns are some of the available facial treatments.
It is crucial to speak with a board-certified dermatologist before beginning any professional dermatological treatment to find the best options for your skin type, concerns, and medical background. They can offer tailored advice and recommendations regarding the most effective course of action for reaching your skincare objectives. To maximise benefits and reduce potential side effects, it is also critical to adhere to post-treatment care instructions and maintain a regular skincare regimen.
Over-the-Counter Solutions for Oily Skin
Over-the-counter (OTC) solutions for oily skin are widely available and can help manage excess oil production, reduce shine, and prevent acne breakouts. Here are some commonly used OTC products and ingredients to consider:
Look for gentle, oil-free cleansers that are specifically designed for oily or acne-prone skin. These cleansers can help remove excess oil, dirt, and impurities without depleting the skin's natural moisture.
Salicylic acid
is a beta hydroxy acid (BHA) that penetrates the pores to dissolve oil and exfoliate dead skin cells, thereby reducing clogged pores and acne breakouts. Using a salicylic acid cleanser once or twice daily can help control oiliness and improve skin texture.
Oil-absorbing sheets or blotting papers are useful for quickly removing excess oil and shine from your skin throughout the day. They can be used as needed to mattify the skin without disturbing makeup.
Even oily skin requires hydration, so use lightweight, non-comedogenic moisturisers that will not clog pores or exacerbate oiliness. Look for oil-free products that provide hydration without adding shine.
Mattifying primers are intended to provide a smooth, matte surface on the skin while also controlling oil and minimising the appearance of pores. They can be used before makeup to extend its wear time and reduce shine throughout the day.
Oil-control or setting powders can be used over makeup to absorb excess oil and reduce shine. For the best results, choose products labelled as oil-absorbing or mattifying.
Gel- or water-based moisturisers are lighter and less likely to clog pores than heavy creams or lotions. They moisturise the skin without causing it to become oily.
Clay masks containing ingredients like kaolin or bentonite clay can help absorb excess oil, unclog pores, and detoxify the skin. Using a clay mask once or twice a week can help control oiliness and improve skin clarity.
Over-the-counter spot treatments containing ingredients like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or sulfur can be applied directly to acne lesions to help reduce inflammation and promote healing.
Home Remedies for Oily Skin Type
If you have oily skin, you may notice that your skin looks shiny, especially in your T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin). Oily skin is caused by the overproduction of sebum, a natural oil that helps protect and moisturize your skin. While there is no cure for oily skin, there are some home remedies that can help control the production of sebum and reduce the appearance of oiliness. Here are some options:
Apple cider vinegar
: Apple cider vinegar can help balance the
pH of your skin

Advanced Skin Care Techniques for Oily Skin
Advanced skincare techniques for oily skin include targeted treatments and procedures that effectively manage excess oil production, reduce shine, and improve overall skin health. Below are some advanced strategies to consider:
Double Cleansing
: To thoroughly remove makeup, sunscreen, and excess oil without stripping the skin, double cleanse with an oil-based cleanser and then a water-based cleanser. This technique ensures a thorough cleanse while maintaining the skin's natural moisture balance.
Chemical Exfoliation
: Use chemical exfoliants like alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) in your skincare routine to unclog pores, remove dead skin cells, and regulate oil production. AHAs such as glycolic acid can help improve skin texture, whereas BHAs such as salicylic acid are especially beneficial for oily, acne-prone skin due to their ability to penetrate pores and dissolve oil.
Oil-Control Serums
: Use oil-control serums with niacinamide, zinc, or witch hazel to help regulate sebum production and reduce pore size. These serums can also help with inflammation and the overall appearance of oily skin.
Hydration without Oil
: Choose lightweight, oil-free moisturisers that provide hydration without adding extra oil to your skin. Look for formulations with hyaluronic acid, glycerin, or ceramides to help keep skin hydrated without clogging pores.
Sebum-Regulating Ingredients
: Incorporate skincare products with sebum-regulating ingredients like retinoids or retinol to help regulate oil production and prevent clogged pores. Retinoids have the added benefit of increasing collagen production and improving skin texture over time.
Microneedling
: Microneedling, also known as collagen induction therapy, is a technique that uses a device with fine needles to create micro-injuries in the skin. This process stimulates collagen production and improves skincare product absorption, resulting in improved skin texture, reduced oiliness, and fewer enlarged pores.
Blue Light Therapy
: Blue light therapy targets acne-causing bacteria on the skin's surface, thereby reducing inflammation and preventing breakouts. It can be especially useful for people who have oily, acne-prone skin and are looking for non-invasive treatments.
Chemical Peels
: Professional chemical peels with ingredients like salicylic acid or glycolic acid can help exfoliate the skin, unclog pores, and control oil production. Regular chemical peel treatments can improve skin texture, and reduce acne breakouts, and oiliness.
Customized Skincare Regimens
: Consider working with a dermatologist or skincare professional to create a customised skincare regimen based on your specific skin concerns and goals. They can suggest advanced treatments and procedures based on your skin type, level of oiliness, and other factors.
The Role of Exfoliation in Managing Oily Skin
Exfoliation helps to eliminate dead skin cells, clear clogged pores, control oil production, and enhance the general texture of the skin, all of which are important for managing oily skin. Here are some benefits of exfoliation for oily skin:
Removes Dead Skin Cells
: Oily skin accumulates dead skin cells faster than other skin types, resulting in dullness and congestion. Exfoliation helps to remove dead cells, revealing fresh, radiant skin beneath.
Unclogs Pores
: Excess oil and dead skin cells can clog pores, causing blackheads, whiteheads, and acne breakouts. Regular exfoliation helps to keep pores clear and reduces the risk of breakouts.
Controls Oil Production
: By eliminating extra oil from the skin's surface and keeping it from getting stuck in pores, exfoliation helps control the amount of oil produced. Exfoliation helps keep the skin balanced and clean, which helps minimise shine and manage oiliness all day.
Improves Absorption of Skincare Products
: Exfoliating removes the dead skin cell barrier, allowing skincare products to penetrate deeper and more effectively. This can improve the effectiveness of other skincare products designed to manage oily skin, such as oil-control serums or treatments.
Promotes Skin Renewal
: Exfoliation increases cell turnover, which is necessary for maintaining healthy, youthful-looking skin. Exfoliation improves skin tone, texture, and overall appearance by stimulating the growth of new skin cells.
When exfoliating oily skin, it is critical to use the right exfoliant and frequency to avoid over-exfoliation, which can strip the skin's natural oils and cause irritation. Here are some exfoliation options appropriate for oily skin:
Chemical exfoliants include alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), which work by breaking down the bonds that hold dead skin cells together, allowing them to be easily removed from the skin's surface. AHAs, such as glycolic acid and lactic acid, help to smooth and brighten the skin, whereas BHAs, such as salicylic acid, are especially beneficial for oily, acne-prone skin because of their ability to penetrate pores and dissolve oil.
Physical exfoliants, like scrubs or exfoliating brushes, remove dead skin cells by physically buffing them away. While physical exfoliation can be beneficial, it is critical to use gentle products and avoid harsh scrubbing, which can irritate the skin and worsen oiliness.
Exfoliating masks with clay or enzymes can help absorb excess oil while gently exfoliating the skin. These masks can be applied once or twice per week to improve skin clarity and texture.
Some cleansers include exfoliating ingredients such as AHAs or BHAs, which provide gentle daily exfoliation while cleansing the skin. These cleansers are ideal for incorporating exfoliation into your daily skincare routine.
When incorporating exfoliation into your skincare routine for oily skin, begin with a low concentration or frequency and gradually increase as tolerated. Pay attention to how your skin reacts and adjust your exfoliation routine accordingly to maintain balance and avoid irritation. If you are unsure which exfoliation method is best for your skin type, speak with a dermatologist for personalised advice.
Importance of Hydration for Oily Skin
Hydration is essential for all skin types, even oily skin. While it may appear counterintuitive to moisturise oily skin, maintaining adequate hydration is critical for several reasons.
When the skin is dehydrated, it may overproduce oil to lubricate and protect itself. By keeping the skin properly hydrated, you can help regulate oil production and prevent excessive oiliness.
A healthy skin barrier protects the skin from external aggressors like pollutants and bacteria while also preventing moisture loss. Dehydrated skin can damage the skin barrier, causing increased sensitivity, inflammation, and a weakened defence against environmental stressors.
Oily skin can experience transient dehydration, which occurs when the skin lacks water but continues to produce excess oil. This can produce a shiny, greasy appearance without addressing the underlying dehydration. Hydrating the skin can help it retain water and avoid transient dehydration.
Proper hydration can help to plump and smooth the skin's surface. Whatever the skin type, hydrated skin appears more supple, radiant, and youthful.
Hydrated skin absorbs skincare products more effectively, allowing them to penetrate deeper and deliver active ingredients. This can improve the efficacy of other skincare products designed to manage oily skin, such as oil-control serums or treatments.
When hydrating oily skin, use lightweight, non-comedogenic moisturisers that will not clog pores or exacerbate oiliness. Look for water-based or gel-based formulations that provide hydration without causing greasy skin. In addition to using moisturizers, you can hydrate oily skin from the inside out by eating a nutritious diet and drinking plenty of water. Consuming water-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables, can help hydrate the skin and improve overall skin health.
Selecting the Right Makeup for Oily Skin
Choosing the right makeup for oily skin entails selecting products that can help control shine, reduce pore appearance, and keep a matte finish all day. Here are some tips for choosing makeup products appropriate for oily skin:
Oil-Free Formulations
: Look for makeup that is labelled as oil-free or non-comedogenic, which means it is designed to be lightweight and will not clog pores or exacerbate oiliness.
Matte Foundations
: Choose matte or oil-free foundations to provide long-lasting coverage and control shine. Matte foundations can help absorb excess oil and provide a smooth, matte finish without appearing greasy.
Powder Foundations
: Powder foundations are great for oily skin because they absorb excess oil and leave a matte finish. Look for finely milled powder foundations that provide buildable coverage without being too heavy or cakey on the skin.
Oil-Control Primers
: Apply oil-control primers before makeup to create a smooth canvas and control shine throughout the day. Look for primers made specifically for oily skin, which often include ingredients like silica or dimethicone to absorb excess oil and reduce the appearance of pores.
Matte Setting Powders
: Use a matte setting powder to seal in your foundation and control oiliness. Focus on areas prone to shine, such as the T-zone, and apply a light dusting of powder to mattify the skin without adding extra layers of product.
Long-Wearing Formulas
: Look for makeup products with long-wearing formulas that will stay on your skin for an extended period, even if it is oily. Look for "long-wear" or "water-resistant" products to ensure that your makeup lasts all day without melting or fading.
Oil-Free Concealer
: Use oil-free concealers to conceal blemishes, dark circles, and flaws without adding excess oil to your skin. Oily skin benefits from matte liquid or cream concealers, which provide seamless coverage without settling into fine lines or pores.
Blotting Papers
: Keep blotting papers handy to quickly absorb excess oil and shine throughout the day without disrupting your makeup. Blotting papers are useful for touch-ups and keep your skin looking fresh and matte without adding additional layers of product.
Avoid Heavy Creams and Emollients
: Heavy creams, emollient foundations, and creamy textures can all contribute to excessive oiliness and cause makeup to slide off the skin. Opt for lightweight, oil-free formulas that will not clog pores or feel greasy on oily skin.
By using makeup products designed specifically for oily skin and incorporating oil-control techniques into your makeup routine, you can reduce shine, control oiliness, and maintain a matte, flawless complexion throughout the day.
Takeaway: How to Get Rid of Oily Skin Type
If you have oily skin, there are several steps you can take to help reduce excess oil and prevent acne:
Avoid using rough towels
: Rough towels can stimulate sebum production and aggravate the issue.
Avoid using harsh chemical soaps
: Excessive chemical use can increase sebum production. It is always preferable to use gentle skin care products.
Avoid eating unhealthy foods
: Carbohydrate-rich diets may not be suitable for everyone. Concerning the issue at hand, carbohydrates contribute to sebum production in the skin.
Use oil-free makeup
: Look for makeup products that are labeled "oil-free" or
"
non-comedogenic
"
(won't clog pores) to avoid adding extra oil to your skin. Remove your makeup and cleanse your face every night before you sleep. Your skin needs to breathe too, just like you! Sleeping with makeup on may result in clogged pores.
Exfoliate
: Regular exfoliation can help to remove dead skin cells and unclog pores. Use a gentle exfoliating scrub once or twice a week.
Manage stress
: Stress can trigger the production of oil and lead to breakouts. Try to find ways to manage your stress, such as exercise, meditation, or deep breathing.
Remember, everyone's skin is different, so it may take some trial and error to find the right combination of products and techniques that work for you. If you're struggling to manage your oily skin, consider talking to a dermatologist for personalized advice and treatment options.
