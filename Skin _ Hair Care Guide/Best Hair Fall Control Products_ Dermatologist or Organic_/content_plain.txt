Hair care is important not just for your looks but also for your general health. Healthy hair helps us look best and also ensures the health of the scalp and hair. Contact a doctor and use good-quality hair products to keep you healthy.
The Role of Dermatologists in Hair Loss Treatment
Diagnosis: Dermatologists review hair loss, taking into account the medical condition, family history, etc. They examine the scalp for signs of dandruff,
psoriasis
, etc. This is a special technique in which a dermatoscope is used to inspect the scalp, creating precise images to determine hair density, follicle health, etc. In some situations, a scalp biopsy may be used to diagnose alopecia areata.
Medical Treatments
: Dermatologists prescribe topical therapies such as minoxidil, which stimulates
hair growth
and is commonly used to treat androgenetic alopecia.
Advanced Therapies
: This includes injecting a high quantity of platelets from the patient's blood into the scalp to promote hair growth and using low-level lasers to boost blood flow to the scalp. Shampoos and serums that have been prescribed or suggested by a
dermatologist
can be used in conjunction with other therapies.
Procedural Interventions
: Dermatologists can undertake hair transplant surgeries such as follicular unit transplantation (FUT) and follicular unit extraction (FUE) to restore hair density in balding areas. This is a cosmetic technique in which
pigments
are applied to the scalp to mimic the look of hair follicles and provide the illusion of thicker hair.
Lifestyle
: Dermatologists can advise patients on dietary adjustments that promote healthy hair development, such as vitamin and mineral intake. They can provide hair care methods, for example, by avoiding harsh chemicals and reducing heat damage.
Education
: Dermatologists educate patients on their main type of hair loss, treatment alternatives, etc. It also offers emotional support and counseling to patients.
