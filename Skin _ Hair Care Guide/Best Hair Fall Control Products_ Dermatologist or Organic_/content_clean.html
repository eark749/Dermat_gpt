<p><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-fall-hair-loss">Hair loss</a> can affect your scalp or your whole body, and it can be temporary or permanent. It can result from heredity, hormonal changes, and medical conditions.  <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/bald-patches">Baldness</a> typically refers to excessive hair loss from your scalp. Hereditary hair loss with age is the most common cause of baldness. Some people prefer to let their hair loss run its course untreated and unhidden. Others may cover it up with hairstyles, makeup, hats, or scarves. </span></p>

<p><span>Diagnosis: Dermatologists review hair loss, taking into account the medical condition, family history, etc. They examine the scalp for signs of dandruff, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/psoriasis">psoriasis</a>, etc. This is a special technique in which a dermatoscope is used to inspect the scalp, creating precise images to determine hair density, follicle health, etc. In some situations, a scalp biopsy may be used to diagnose alopecia areata.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Medical Treatments</b><span>: Dermatologists prescribe topical therapies such as minoxidil, which stimulates <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hair-regrow-serum%20">hair growth</a> and is commonly used to treat androgenetic alopecia.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Advanced Therapies</b><span>: This includes injecting a high quantity of platelets from the patient's blood into the scalp to promote hair growth and using low-level lasers to boost blood flow to the scalp. Shampoos and serums that have been prescribed or suggested by a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">dermatologist</a> can be used in conjunction with other therapies.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Procedural Interventions</b><span>: Dermatologists can undertake hair transplant surgeries such as follicular unit transplantation (FUT) and follicular unit extraction (FUE) to restore hair density in balding areas. This is a cosmetic technique in which <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">pigments</a> are applied to the scalp to mimic the look of hair follicles and provide the illusion of thicker hair.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Lifestyle</b><span>: Dermatologists can advise patients on dietary adjustments that promote healthy hair development, such as vitamin and mineral intake. They can provide hair care methods, for example, by avoiding harsh chemicals and reducing heat damage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Education</b><span>: Dermatologists educate patients on their main type of hair loss, treatment alternatives, etc. It also offers emotional support and counseling to patients.</span></p>
