Making DIY skincare treatments at home can be appealing, but it's critical to recognise the hazards connected with common substances. In this blog, we'll look at seven DIY skincare ingredients and the concerns they may present.
Navigating the realm of DIY skincare can be challenging, especially given the abundance of chemicals accessible. While many natural chemicals have skincare benefits, they can also be toxic or produce severe responses if used incorrectly. Lemon juice, baking soda, sugar scrubs, essential oils, spicy spices, toothpaste, and rubbing alcohol are all frequent components to avoid when making your own skincare. When making DIY skincare products, it is critical to thoroughly research the ingredients, patch-test new formulations, and exercise caution when using potent or potentially irritating ingredients. Choosing gentle, proven ingredients and adhering to proper skincare practices can help you achieve healthy, radiant skin while minimising the risk of harm or irritation.
Unmasking the Truth: Popular DIY Ingredients and Their Effects
Here's a closer look at some popular DIY skincare ingredients, their effects, and the considerations for using them:
Honey
: Honey has antibacterial and antioxidant qualities and is a natural humectant. It can lessen inflammation, encourage healing, and
moisturise
the skin. However, some people may be allergic to honey, so a patch test should be performed before applying it to the skin.
Coconut Oil
: Coconut oil is high in fatty acids and has moisturising and antibacterial properties. It can hydrate and protect the skin from bacteria and fungi. However, coconut oil is comedogenic for some people, which means it can clog pores and cause breakouts, particularly in those with oily or acne-prone skin.
Oatmeal
: Oatmeal is soothing and anti-inflammatory, making it beneficial for relieving itching, irritation, and inflammation. It can be added to homemade masks and baths to soothe irritated or sensitive skin. However, since whole oats might be too abrasive, finely ground muesli is preferred.
Yoghurt
: Lactic acid, an ingredient in yoghurt, has brightening and exfoliating qualities. It can aid in clearing clogged pores, removing dead skin cells, and enhancing skin texture. Furthermore, yogurt's probiotics might support a balanced skin microbiome. However, some people, especially those who have dairy allergies or lactose intolerance, can get acne and irritation from dairy-based products like yoghurt.
Avocado
: Rich in fatty acids, vitamins, and antioxidants, avocado is nourishing and hydrating for the skin. It can relieve irritation, hydrate dry skin, and shield the skin from the elements. But avocado is heavy, and for some skin types, it might be too occlusive, causing greasiness or breakouts.
Turmeric
: Turmeric contains anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that can help reduce redness, acne, and
ageing
. It's often used in DIY masks for brightening and evening out the skin tone. However, turmeric can stain the skin and clothing, so use sparingly and thoroughly after application.
Aloe Vera
: Aloe vera is good for sunburns, rashes, and irritated skin because it is calming, hydrating, and anti-inflammatory. It can help to soothe redness, reduce inflammation, and promote healing. Pure aloe vera gel is preferable to commercial products that may include additives and preservatives.
Lemon Juice: Citrus Scourge or Skin Saboteur?
Lemon juice is a contentious skincare ingredient due to its acidic nature and the potential for skin irritation and photosensitivity. Here's a closer look at the benefits and risks of applying lemon juice to the skin:
Benefits
:
Lemon juice contains citric acid, an astringent that can help tighten pores and reduce excess oil on the skin.
The acidic nature of lemon juice can aid in exfoliation, removing dead skin cells and promoting a brighter complexion.
Lemon juice is high in
vitamin C
, a potent antioxidant that can protect the skin from environmental damage and stimulate collagen production.
Risks
:
The acidic pH of lemon juice can be too harsh for some people, causing irritation, redness, and stinging sensations, particularly those with sensitive or reactive skin.
Lemon juice contains psoralens, which can make the skin more sensitive to sunlight, resulting in sunburn and
hyperpigmentation
when exposed to UV rays.
Applying undiluted lemon juice directly to the skin can cause chemical burns and damage the skin's protective barrier, resulting in dryness, inflammation, and increased susceptibility to environmental stressors.
The Acidic Argument: ACV’s Hidden Harms on Skin
Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a popular natural remedy with a variety of claimed health benefits, but its use in skincare is debatable due to its acidic nature and potential risks. Here's a closer look at the hidden risks of using ACV on your skin:
ACV is highly acidic, typically with a pH of 2 to 3. While some acidity can be beneficial for exfoliation and pH regulation, using undiluted ACV or overly acidic formulations can disrupt the skin's natural pH balance, causing irritation, redness, and inflammation.
The acidic nature of ACV can be too harsh for many skin types, particularly those with sensitive or compromised skin barrier function. Applying undiluted ACV directly to the skin can cause burning, stinging, and discomfort, especially on sensitive areas like the face or mucous membranes.
Prolonged or excessive use of undiluted ACV can result in chemical burns and damage to the skin's protective barrier. This can cause dryness, peeling, and increased sensitivity to environmental stressors, making the skin more susceptible to irritation and infection.
Similar to lemon juice, ACV contains compounds that can make the skin more sensitive to sunlight, resulting in sunburns and hyperpigmentation when exposed to UV rays. Using ACV on the skin without adequate sun protection can amplify these risks and jeopardise skin health.
Some people may be allergic to specific components of ACV, such as acetic acid or other organic acids found in vinegar. Allergic reactions can cause redness, itching, swelling, or hives and may necessitate medical attention to treat.
Commercially available ACV products may contain impurities, additives, or contaminants that irritate the skin or cause adverse reactions. Before using ACV on your skin, make sure to choose high-quality, organic products and perform patch tests.
Baking Soda and Skin: An Alkaline Adversary
Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is a versatile household ingredient that is commonly used for cleaning, cooking, and even skincare. However, when it comes to skincare, baking soda can be more of an alkaline antagonist than a friend. Here is why:
Disruption of pH Balance
: The pH scale measures a substance's acidity or alkalinity, with 7 indicating neutral, below 7 acidic, and above 7 alkaline. Baking soda has a high pH, usually around 9, making it alkaline. When applied to the skin, which has a slightly acidic pH (4.5 to 5.5), baking soda can upset the pH balance, causing irritation, dryness, and inflammation.
Properties
: Baking soda's gritty texture makes it a popular exfoliant in do-it-yourself skincare products. However, its abrasive nature can cause micro-tears on the skin's surface, resulting in irritation, redness, and sensitivity. Using baking soda as a scrub or
cleanser
can harm the skin's protective barrier and aggravate existing skin conditions like acne or rosacea.
Over-Exfoliation
: Exfoliation is necessary for skincare, but it should be done gently and in moderation. Baking soda, with its harsh abrasive properties, can cause over-exfoliation if used too frequently or vigorously. Excessive exfoliation can damage the skin's integrity, disrupt its moisture barrier, and increase the risk of inflammation and breakouts.
Skin Sensitivity
: Baking soda can cause adverse reactions in people who have sensitive or reactive skin. Baking soda's alkaline nature can cause burning, stinging, and itching sensations, particularly in sensitive areas such as the face and neck. People with conditions like eczema or dermatitis should avoid using baking soda on their skin altogether.
Potential Side Effects
: Prolonged or excessive use of baking soda on the skin can cause more serious problems, such as chemical burns, allergic reactions, or even permanent damage to the skin structure. It's essential to use caution and avoid using baking soda in DIY skincare recipes that involve leaving it on the skin for extended periods.
The Dark Side of Natural: When Good Intentions Harm Skin
While natural ingredients can provide numerous benefits to skincare, it is important to note that not all natural substances are safe or effective when applied to the skin. Here are some examples of the potential risks associated with specific natural ingredients:
Essential oils
: Although essential oils are derived from plants and are frequently touted for their aromatherapeutic and skincare benefits, they can be extremely concentrated and powerful. Some essential oils, such as citrus oils, peppermint oil, and cinnamon oil, can irritate or sensitise the skin, especially when applied undiluted or in high concentrations. Furthermore, certain essential oils can cause photosensitivity or allergic reactions in some people.
Citrus Fruits
: Lemon, lime, and orange are high in vitamin C and antioxidants, making them popular DIY skincare ingredients. However, the high acidity of citrus fruits can be too much for some skin types, causing irritation, redness, and even chemical burns. Citrus fruits can also make the skin more sensitive to sunlight, increasing the risk of sunburn and hyperpigmentation.
Baking Soda
: Sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda, is a common natural exfoliant and deodorizer. Its alkaline pH, however, has the potential to upset the skin's normal pH equilibrium, causing dryness, irritation, and inflammation. The abrasive texture of baking soda can also lead to tiny surface rips in the skin, aggravating pre-existing skin disorders and weakening the skin's barrier function.
Coconut Oil
: Coconut oil is praised for its moisturizing and antimicrobial properties, but it's also highly comedogenic for some individuals. This means that, especially for people with oily or acne-prone skin, it can clog pores and worsen breakouts or acne. Those who are allergic to or sensitive to coconut may also find it difficult to tolerate coconut oil.
Some Herbs and Botanicals
: Although a lot of herbs and botanical extracts are beneficial for skincare, some people may find certain herbs or extracts irritating or allergic. For instance, some people may experience allergic reactions or find that ingredients like witch hazel, peppermint, and eucalyptus are too harsh for their skin type. It's essential to patch-test new ingredients and formulations and monitor for any adverse reactions.
Essential Oils: Aromatic Allies or Dermatologic Dangers?
Essential oils are aromatic compounds derived from plants and used for a variety of applications, including skincare, aromatherapy, and medicine. While essential oils can provide numerous benefits, they also pose risks and considerations when applied to the skin. Let us take a closer look at the advantages and disadvantages of using essential oils in skincare:
Aromatic Allies
:
Essential oils contain active compounds with therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant effects. When used correctly, they can improve skin health and address a variety of skin issues such as acne, inflammation, and ageing.
In addition to their physical effects, essential oils can provide psychological benefits via aromatherapy. Inhaling the aroma of essential oils can help with relaxation, stress reduction, and mood enhancement, all of which contribute to overall well-being.
Essential oils are commonly used in skincare products for their natural fragrance, which provides a pleasant scent without the use of synthetic fragrances or additives. This can improve the sensory experience of using skincare products by creating a spa-like environment.
Dermatologic Dangers
:
Essential oils are highly concentrated and potent, which means they may cause skin sensitization or allergic reactions in some people. Certain essential oils, such as citrus oils (e.g., lemon, lime, orange) and peppermint oil, are more likely to cause skin irritation and should be used with caution, particularly when applied undiluted or at high concentrations.
Some essential oils contain compounds that make the skin more sensitive to sunlight, resulting in sunburn and hyperpigmentation when exposed to UV rays. Phototoxic essential oils, such as bergamot oil, can have serious side effects when applied to the skin before sun exposure.
Prolonged or excessive exposure to essential oils can cause contact dermatitis, which is characterised by redness, itching, swelling, and skin irritation. This is more common in people with sensitive or reactive skin, and it can happen even with highly diluted essential oil formulations.
Certain essential oils may interact with medications or worsen certain health conditions. Some essential oils, for example, may interfere with blood clotting or affect hormone levels, rendering them unsuitable for use by people who have specific medical conditions or are taking certain medications.
Sugar and Salt Scrubs: Sweet Seduction with a Rough Edge
Sugar and salt scrubs are popular exfoliating treatments that have both benefits and drawbacks for your skin. Here's a closer look at the pros and cons of using sugar and salt scrubs:
Pros
:
Sugar and salt scrubs work by physically removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin, revealing smoother, brighter skin underneath. Regular exfoliation can help improve skin texture, reduce roughness, and promote cell turnover.
Sugar scrubs are generally gentler on the skin than salt scrubs, making them appropriate for sensitive or delicate skin types. The smaller, smoother particles of sugar provide effective exfoliation without causing excessive irritation or micro-tears on the skin's surface.
Sugar contains natural humectants, which can draw moisture into the skin and keep it hydrated and moisturised after exfoliation. Sugar scrubs are frequently enriched with nourishing oils or butter, which enhance their hydrating properties and leave the skin soft and supple.
Sugar and salt scrubs are versatile and can be tailored to different skin types and preferences by adding additional ingredients. For example, adding essential oils, botanical extracts, or vitamin-rich ingredients can enhance the benefits of the scrub and provide additional skincare benefits.
Cons
:
Salt scrubs, in particular, can be too harsh for certain skin types, especially if the salt crystals are large or rough. Scrubbing too vigorously can cause micro-tears in the skin's surface, resulting in irritation, redness, and sensitivity. It's essential to use gentle pressure and avoid scrubbing too vigorously, especially on sensitive or delicate areas of the skin.
Salt has natural drying properties, which can remove the skin's natural oils and disrupt its moisture balance. While salt scrubs can be beneficial for oily or acne-prone skin, they can be overly drying for people with dry or sensitive skin, resulting in increased dryness, flakiness, and irritation.
Some people may be allergic to ingredients commonly found in sugar and salt scrubs, such as fragrances, essential oils, or botanical extracts. These ingredients may cause allergic reactions or sensitivities in some people, resulting in itching, redness, or irritation following exfoliation.
Exfoliating with sugar or salt scrubs can make the skin more sensitive to sunlight, increasing the risk of sunburn and hyperpigmentation. It's essential to use
sunscreen
with a high SPF after exfoliating and avoid prolonged sun exposure to minimize the risk of sun damage.
The Toothpaste Temptation: Busting the Acne Treatment Myth
Using toothpaste to treat acne has been a popular home remedy for decades. However, it is critical to distinguish between fact and fiction when it comes to this skincare myth. Here's a closer look at the truth behind the toothpaste temptation:
Myth: Toothpaste dries out pimples.
Fact
:
While toothpaste contains ingredients like baking soda, menthol, and hydrogen peroxide that can dry out pimples, it's not formulated for use on the skin. Toothpaste is intended for oral use and contains ingredients such as flavours, detergents, and abrasives that can be harsh and irritating to the skin.
Some toothpaste formulations may contain ingredients like sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), which can deplete the skin's natural oils and disrupt the moisture barrier. Applying toothpaste to the skin can cause chemical burns, redness, and peeling, especially if left on for too long or applied to open wounds or sensitive areas.
Toothpaste contains several ingredients that can cause allergic reactions or sensitivities in some people. Mint flavourings, fluoride, and other toothpaste additives can cause itching, redness, or swelling when applied to the skin, especially in people with sensitive or reactive skin.
Toothpaste is not formulated specifically for acne treatment and does not contain ingredients proven to effectively target acne bacteria or reduce inflammation. While some anecdotal evidence suggests that toothpaste can temporarily reduce the size of pimples due to its drying effect, there are safer and more effective acne treatments available.
Alternative Acne Treatment
:
Salicylic Acid
: Look for skincare products that contain salicylic acid, a beta hydroxy acid that helps to unclog pores, reduce inflammation, and prevent future breakouts.
Benzoyl Peroxide
: This acne treatment kills acne-causing bacteria while also reducing excess oil production. It comes in a variety of formulations, including cleansers, spot treatments, and leave-on gels.
Retinoids
: Topical retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that help clear pores, speed up cell turnover, and lessen acne lesions. Examples of these include tretinoin and adapalene. In lesser strengths, they can be purchased over-the-counter or with a prescription.
Gentle Cleaning
: To get rid of extra oil, debris, and pollutants without removing the skin's natural moisture barrier, use a gentle cleanser designed for skin that is prone to acne. Avoid harsh scrubs or abrasive cleansers that can irritate the skin and exacerbate acne.
Beyond DIY: Steering Clear of Homemade Hazards
It can be challenging to navigate the world of homemade skincare products because some of the recipes may contain ingredients that, when applied topically, may cause more harm than good. Here are some common hazards to steer clear of when venturing into DIY skincare:
Harsh Scrubs
: Do-it-yourself scrubs that contain ingredients like sugar, salt, or baking soda may be too abrasive and result in irritation, inflammation, and tiny tears in the skin. Choose kinder exfoliants instead, such as rice flour or finely ground oats.
Citrus Juices
: Lemon juice and other citrus juices are often used in DIY skincare for their brightening and astringent properties. However, especially when exposed to sunlight, their high acidity can result in skin irritation, redness, and photosensitivity.
Essential Oils
: Although essential oils have potential benefits for skincare, some people may experience allergic reactions or sensitivities to them due to their potency. Certain essential oils, such as citrus oils and peppermint oil, are more likely to irritate and should be used with caution, if at all.
Toothpaste
: Using toothpaste as a spot treatment for acne is a common DIY skincare myth. But, the menthol, fluoride, and detergents found in toothpaste can be excessively abrasive and drying for the skin, causing irritation, redness, and chemical burns.
Baking Soda
: Alkaline baking soda can upset the skin's normal pH balance, causing dryness, irritation, and inflammation. Baking soda can be more harmful than beneficial when used as a cleanser or exfoliant, especially for people with delicate or compromised skin barriers.
Vinegar
: Although apple cider vinegar (ACV) is frequently promoted as having antibacterial and exfoliating qualities, it is extremely acidic and can irritate skin, burn it, and trigger sensitivities, particularly when used undiluted or in high concentrations.
Spices
: Spices like cinnamon, ginger, and cayenne pepper are sometimes used in DIY skincare for their purported warming or exfoliating effects. However, especially in sensitive areas of the skin, these spices can be extremely irritating and cause burning or stinging sensations.
DIY Sunscreen
: It is dangerous to make your sunscreen because it can be difficult to get the right SPF protection and guarantee even coverage. The risk of sunburns, early ageing, and skin cancer may increase if homemade sunscreens are unable to offer sufficient defence against damaging UV radiation.
Deciphering Safe from Unsafe: Learning to Read Your Skin
Understanding your skin's specific needs, sensitivities, and reactions is necessary to determine whether a skincare product or component is safe for it. Some ideas for learning how to read your skin and making informed skincare decisions include knowing your skin type, paying attention to sensitivities, patch testing new products, reading ingredient labels, avoiding harsh ingredients, listening to your skin, seeking professional advice, and consistency is key. Learning to read your skin and understand its unique traits, sensitivities, and reactions will allow you to make informed selections regarding skincare products and components that are both safe and beneficial for your skin.
Transitioning to Trustworthy Treatments: Alternatives to Home Remedies
Finding skincare products and ingredients that are safe and effective for your skin and supported by science is essential when making the switch from do-it-yourself home remedies to reputable skincare treatments. Here are a few options to think about:
Look for skincare products that contain clinically proven ingredients and address specific skin concerns such as acne, ageing, dryness, or hyperpigmentation. Examples include cleansers, moisturisers, serums, and spot treatments containing salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, retinoids,
hyaluronic acid
, vitamin C, and
niacinamide
.
Consider incorporating medical-grade skincare products into your routine, as they are formulated with higher concentrations of active ingredients and are rigorously tested for safety and efficacy. Dermatologists and skincare professionals frequently recommend these products to treat a variety of skin concerns, including acne, rosacea, melasma, and ageing.
Consult a dermatologist
if you have stubborn or severe skin issues. They can prescribe prescription-strength medications or treatments that are tailored to your specific needs. Prescription options may include topical retinoids, antibiotics, corticosteroids, oral medications, or in-office procedures like chemical peels, laser therapy, or microneedling.
Consider scheduling regular visits to a licensed esthetician or skincare professional for professional treatments that complement your at-home skincare routine. Professional treatments may include facials, chemical peels, microdermabrasion, LED therapy, or customized skincare protocols designed to address your skin concerns.
Consider incorporating holistic skincare practices into your routine, such as mindful eating, stress management, adequate hydration, and regular exercise. These lifestyle factors can play a significant role in supporting overall skin health and vitality.
Regardless of your skincare concerns, always prioritize sun protection by using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher every day, even on cloudy days. Sunscreen helps protect the skin from harmful UV radiation, prevents premature aging, and reduces the risk of skin cancer.
The Professional Perspective: When to Seek Expert Advice
Seeking expert advice from a dermatologist or skincare professional is critical when dealing with specific skin concerns or challenges that necessitate professional evaluation and treatment. Here are some situations in which it is advisable to seek professional advice:
Persistent Skin Issues
: If you have tried various over-the-counter remedies and still have persistent or recurrent skin issues like acne, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, or dermatitis, it is time to see a dermatologist. A dermatologist can assess your skin condition, determine the underlying causes, and recommend appropriate treatment options, such as prescription medications or procedures.
Severe Acne
: Acne that does not respond to over-the-counter treatments or is accompanied by deep cysts, nodules, or scarring requires professional evaluation and treatment. A dermatologist can recommend oral medications, topical treatments, or in-office procedures such as corticosteroid injections, extraction, or isotretinoin therapy to help control acne and prevent long-term scarring.
Skin Cancer Concerns
: If you notice any changes in the size, shape, colour, or texture of moles, freckles, or other skin lesions, consult a dermatologist right away. Early detection and treatment of skin cancer greatly improves outcomes. Dermatologists can conduct skin exams, biopsies, and other diagnostic tests to evaluate suspicious lesions and recommend the best treatment.
Chronic Skin Conditions
: Dermatologists frequently treat and monitor chronic skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and rosacea. To help control symptoms, avoid flare-ups, and enhance general skin health and quality of life, dermatologists can create individualised treatment regimens, prescribe drugs, and provide lifestyle advice.
Skin Ageing Concerns
: A dermatologist or skincare specialist can offer advice on efficient anti-aging treatments and procedures if you are interested in addressing ageing signs like fine lines, wrinkles, sagging skin, or age spots. Depending on your specific needs and objectives, your options may include chemical peels, laser therapy, prescription retinoids, cosmetic injectables, microneedling, and laser therapy.
Complex Skincare Regimens
: See a skincare professional if you are feeling overwhelmed by the wide range of skincare products and treatments out there and are not sure where to begin or how to make the most out of your skincare regimen. They can assess your skin type, concerns, and goals and recommend a personalized skincare regimen that addresses your specific needs and preferences.
Embracing a Holistic Approach to Skincare: Safe and Effective Alternatives
Taking a holistic approach to skincare entails considering not only the products you use on your skin, but also your lifestyle, diet, and overall well-being. Here are some safe and effective alternatives to traditional skincare products and practices that support a holistic approach:
A healthy diet high in antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids can improve skin health from the inside out. Consume a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats to nourish your skin and keep it hydrated, resilient, and glowing. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your skin hydrated and support detoxification.
Choose gentle, non-stripping cleansers that effectively remove dirt, oil, and impurities while preserving the skin's natural moisture barrier. Look for sulfate-free formulas that include hydrating ingredients like glycerin, hyaluronic acid, or botanical extracts to cleanse the skin without causing dryness or irritation.
Choose skincare products formulated with natural, organic, and plant-based ingredients whenever possible. Look for products free of harsh chemicals, synthetic fragrances, and preservatives that can irritate or sensitise the skin. Aloe vera, chamomile, green tea, and calendula are all soothing and anti-inflammatory ingredients that can help with skin care.
Incorporate therapeutic-grade essential oils into your skincare routine for both aromatherapy and skincare benefits. Choose lavender, rosehip, frankincense, and tea tree oil, which are known for their calming, rejuvenating, and antimicrobial properties. To reduce the risk of skin irritation, dilute essential oils with a carrier oil, such as jojoba or coconut oil, before applying them.
Explore herbal remedies and botanical extracts known for their skincare benefits. Ingredients like witch hazel, rosemary, licorice root, and turmeric have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties that can help soothe, heal, and protect the skin. Incorporate herbal infusions, teas, or topical treatments into your skincare routine to harness their healing powers.
Practice stress management techniques like meditation, deep breathing, yoga, or tai chi to promote relaxation, reduce cortisol levels, and support overall skin health. Chronic stress can contribute to skin issues like acne, eczema, and premature aging, so finding healthy ways to manage stress is essential for maintaining clear, radiant skin.
Wear broad-spectrum SPF sunscreen every day to protect your skin from harmful UV rays, even on cloudy or overcast days. Mineral-based sunscreens with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide as active ingredients provide broad-spectrum protection without potentially harmful chemicals. Wear protective clothing, sunglasses, and seek shade during peak sunlight hours to reduce sun exposure and prevent sun damage.
By taking a holistic approach to skincare that takes into account both internal and external factors, you can naturally support the health and vitality of your skin. Focus on nourishing your body, mind, and spirit with healthy practices and products that promote balance, harmony, and radiance both inside and out.
