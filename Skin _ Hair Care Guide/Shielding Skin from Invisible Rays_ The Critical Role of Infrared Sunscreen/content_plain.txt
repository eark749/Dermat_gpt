Shielding the skin from invisible rays is an important component of skincare, and while most people are aware of the importance of protecting against harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, the importance of protecting against infrared (IR) radiation has grown in recent years. Near-infrared (NIR), short-wavelength infrared (SWIR), and mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) radiation are the three types of infrared radiation. When examining their impact on skin health, NIR and specific components of SWIR are particularly relevant.
Understanding Infrared Rays and Skin Health
Infrared (IR) rays are part of the electromagnetic spectrum and exist outside of the visible light range. They are classified into three wavelength groups: near-infrared (NIR), short-wavelength infrared (SWIR), and mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR). NIR and sections of SWIR are particularly important in terms of their effects on skin health. In skincare, protecting the skin from infrared rays is becoming more important. While traditional sunscreens primarily protect against UV rays, newer formulations are being developed to give broader protection, including infrared radiation defence. Antioxidants and particular IR filters may be used in these formulations to reduce the damaging effects of IR rays on the skin.
The Science of Infrared Radiation and Its Effects
Infrared (IR) radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation that has wavelengths that are longer than visible light but shorter than microwaves. It is classified into three types: near-infrared (NIR), short-wavelength infrared (SWIR), and mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR), each with unique properties and consequences. Understanding the science of infrared radiation and its effects on the body is essential for designing protective measures and skincare methods to reduce potential damage and maintain skin health.
