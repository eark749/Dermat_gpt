<div><img alt="Understanding Infrared Rays and Skin Health" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_4_-_2023-12-05T165909.607_480x480.png?v=1701775780"/></div>
<p><span>Infrared (IR) rays are part of the electromagnetic spectrum and exist outside of the visible light range. They are classified into three wavelength groups: near-infrared (NIR), short-wavelength infrared (SWIR), and mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR). NIR and sections of SWIR are particularly important in terms of their effects on skin health. In skincare, protecting the skin from infrared rays is becoming more important. While traditional sunscreens primarily protect against UV rays, newer formulations are being developed to give broader protection, including infrared radiation defence. Antioxidants and particular IR filters may be used in these formulations to reduce the damaging effects of IR rays on the skin.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Science of Infrared Radiation and Its Effects</b></h3>
<p><span>Infrared (IR) radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation that has wavelengths that are longer than visible light but shorter than microwaves. It is classified into three types: near-infrared (NIR), short-wavelength infrared (SWIR), and mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR), each with unique properties and consequences. Understanding the science of infrared radiation and its effects on the body is essential for designing protective measures and skincare methods to reduce potential damage and maintain skin health.</span></p>

<h3><b>Environmental Factors and the Need for Infrared Sunscreen</b></h3>
<p><span>Environmental factors, particularly solar radiation and its impact on skin health, play an important role in emphasising the importance of including infrared (IR) protection in sunscreen formulas. Environmental factors such as solar radiation composition, changing environmental conditions, daily sun exposure, impact on skin health, UV-IR synergistic effects, increasing skin concerns, outdoor lifestyles, global sun protection awareness, holistic skin care, sustainability and environmental impact, need for regulatory standards, and inclusive protection are examples of how environmental factors emphasise the need for IR sunscreen. This understanding promotes the advancement of sunscreen technology, pushing the creation of formulations that address a larger spectrum of UV radiation for improved skin protection and health.</span></p>
