<p><b></b><span>Caffeine is found in coffee, espresso, tea, colas, and energy drinks. If these are your go-to beverages, you may be wondering if caffeine causes hair loss. The good news is that you do not have to switch to decaf to avoid hair loss. There is no evidence that caffeine intake causes hair loss.  However, caffeine may have an impact on the hair growth cycle. Below, we address the issue "Is coffee bad for your hair?" by analysing the evidence on caffeine and hair loss. We also look at the potential hair advantages of caffeine and how to treat hair thinning.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Relationship Between Caffeine and Hair</b></h2>
<div><img alt="The Relationship Between Caffeine and Hair" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/The_Relationship_Between_Caffeine_and_Hair_480x480.jpg?v=1722854010"/></div>
<p><span>There has been little scientific research into the effects of caffeine on human <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hair-regrow-serum%20">hair growth</a> or loss.  However, as previously stated, there is no conclusive evidence that caffeine causes hair loss. In case you are curious, there is currently no scientific evidence linking normal alcohol consumption to <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-fall-hair-loss">hair loss</a>.  What we do know is that some early lab research (in vitro) have found a link between coffee and the baldness-causing hormone testosterone and its derivatives. Caffeine, according to studies, inhibits the expression of some proteins influenced by testosterone, resulting in a net growth boost on hair follicles.</span></p>
<p><span>Caffeine's potential to influence androgen-related hair follicle growth has a considerable impact on the hair follicles of persons suffering from androgenic alopecia, also known as androgenetic alopecia. Caffeine was given topically to hair follicles (in vitro), and the researchers observed increased anagen duration (a longer hair-growing stage in the development cycle) in caffeine-enhanced hair. The researchers also observed hair shaft elongation (growth). There is more evidence to suggest that other (naturally) caffeine-containing items, such as green tea, may have similar benefits, though it is unclear if the caffeine is responsible for green tea's propensity to stimulate hair growth.</span></p>

<p><span>Caffeine is a stimulant, which means it activates your brain and neurological system. It also promotes the circulation of hormones like cortisol and adrenaline throughout the body. Caffeine, in little dosages, can help you feel more invigorated and concentrated.</span></p>
<h3><b>Common Myths About Caffeine and Hair Loss</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Common Myths About Caffeine and Hair Loss" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Common_Myths_About_Caffeine_and_Hair_Loss_480x480.jpg?v=1722854009"/></div>
<p><span>Some of the most common are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Myth</b><span>: Can caffeine cause hair loss?</span><b> </b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reality</b><span>: Fortunately, for coffee lovers, caffeine does not cause hair loss or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/bald-patches">baldness</a>. The vast majority of hair loss is genetic. It is been linked to elevated levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the body. DHT is a testosterone derivative, which is why male or female pattern baldness is more common in men than women.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Myth</b><span>: Drinking coffee can cause hair loss. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reality</b><span>: The ingredients in black tea and coffee can deplete your iron levels, resulting in hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Myth</b><span>: Is caffeine <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/shampoos">shampoo</a> effective for hair loss? </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reality</b><span>: There is no scientific evidence or research to suggest that using caffeine shampoo will reduce and/or alleviate your symptoms of hair loss, thinning hair, or male pattern baldness.  Furthermore, the medical community does not recommend caffeine-based shampoos for treating hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Myth</b><span>: Can you prevent genetic hair loss? </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reality</b><span>: Although hereditary hair loss cannot be prevented, medicinal therapies such as minoxidil, finasteride, and spironolactone can help maintain, improve, and maximize hair growth. The FDA has approved topical minoxidil for the treatment of male and female hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Myth</b><span>: Caffeine has short-term benefits. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reality</b><span>: Just as a cup of coffee only keeps you up for a few hours, topical caffeinated medications provide benefits for a limited time. That is, they do not treat <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-skin-renewer-retinol-serum">fine lines and wrinkles</a>, under-eye bags, or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-ultra-heal-under-eye-cream">puffiness</a>, but rather temporarily alter their look.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Myth</b><span>: Does caffeine improve male pattern baldness? </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reality</b><span>: Caffeine has also been proven in studies to help block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a hormone associated with hair follicle destruction and androgenetic alopecia, often known as male or female-pattern hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Myth</b><span>: Does using topical caffeine help with hair loss? </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reality</b><span>: A study directly compared topical caffeine and topical minoxidil. A group of 210 males used one of these two therapies every day. After six months, both groups had improved hair growth, reduced hair loss, and higher hair thickness.</span></p>

<h4><span>Caffeine-containing shampoos and lotions can be applied to the scalp to treat hair follicles without the risks associated with oral caffeine. According to studies, caffeine can be found in the scalp up to 24 hours after administration. In one trial, a topical caffeine lotion was found to be as effective as minoxidil, a hair loss treatment, in males with AGA.</span></h4>
