Caffeine is found in coffee, espresso, tea, colas, and energy drinks. If these are your go-to beverages, you may be wondering if caffeine causes hair loss. The good news is that you do not have to switch to decaf to avoid hair loss. There is no evidence that caffeine intake causes hair loss.  However, caffeine may have an impact on the hair growth cycle. Below, we address the issue "Is coffee bad for your hair?" by analysing the evidence on caffeine and hair loss. We also look at the potential hair advantages of caffeine and how to treat hair thinning.
The Relationship Between Caffeine and Hair
There has been little scientific research into the effects of caffeine on human
hair growth
or loss.  However, as previously stated, there is no conclusive evidence that caffeine causes hair loss. In case you are curious, there is currently no scientific evidence linking normal alcohol consumption to
hair loss
.  What we do know is that some early lab research (in vitro) have found a link between coffee and the baldness-causing hormone testosterone and its derivatives. Caffeine, according to studies, inhibits the expression of some proteins influenced by testosterone, resulting in a net growth boost on hair follicles.
Caffeine's potential to influence androgen-related hair follicle growth has a considerable impact on the hair follicles of persons suffering from androgenic alopecia, also known as androgenetic alopecia. Caffeine was given topically to hair follicles (in vitro), and the researchers observed increased anagen duration (a longer hair-growing stage in the development cycle) in caffeine-enhanced hair. The researchers also observed hair shaft elongation (growth). There is more evidence to suggest that other (naturally) caffeine-containing items, such as green tea, may have similar benefits, though it is unclear if the caffeine is responsible for green tea's propensity to stimulate hair growth.
How Caffeine Affects the Body
Caffeine is a stimulant, which means it activates your brain and neurological system. It also promotes the circulation of hormones like cortisol and adrenaline throughout the body. Caffeine, in little dosages, can help you feel more invigorated and concentrated.
Common Myths About Caffeine and Hair Loss
Some of the most common are:
Myth
: Can caffeine cause hair loss?
Reality
: Fortunately, for coffee lovers, caffeine does not cause hair loss or
baldness
. The vast majority of hair loss is genetic. It is been linked to elevated levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the body. DHT is a testosterone derivative, which is why male or female pattern baldness is more common in men than women.
Myth
: Drinking coffee can cause hair loss.
Reality
: The ingredients in black tea and coffee can deplete your iron levels, resulting in hair loss.
Myth
: Is caffeine
shampoo
effective for hair loss?
Reality
: There is no scientific evidence or research to suggest that using caffeine shampoo will reduce and/or alleviate your symptoms of hair loss, thinning hair, or male pattern baldness.  Furthermore, the medical community does not recommend caffeine-based shampoos for treating hair loss.
Myth
: Can you prevent genetic hair loss?
Reality
: Although hereditary hair loss cannot be prevented, medicinal therapies such as minoxidil, finasteride, and spironolactone can help maintain, improve, and maximize hair growth. The FDA has approved topical minoxidil for the treatment of male and female hair loss.
Myth
: Caffeine has short-term benefits.
Reality
: Just as a cup of coffee only keeps you up for a few hours, topical caffeinated medications provide benefits for a limited time. That is, they do not treat
fine lines and wrinkles
, under-eye bags, or
puffiness
, but rather temporarily alter their look.
Myth
: Does caffeine improve male pattern baldness?
Reality
: Caffeine has also been proven in studies to help block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a hormone associated with hair follicle destruction and androgenetic alopecia, often known as male or female-pattern hair loss.
Myth
: Does using topical caffeine help with hair loss?
Reality
: A study directly compared topical caffeine and topical minoxidil. A group of 210 males used one of these two therapies every day. After six months, both groups had improved hair growth, reduced hair loss, and higher hair thickness.
Scientific Studies on Caffeine and Hair Health
Caffeine-containing shampoos and lotions can be applied to the scalp to treat hair follicles without the risks associated with oral caffeine. According to studies, caffeine can be found in the scalp up to 24 hours after administration. In one trial, a topical caffeine lotion was found to be as effective as minoxidil, a hair loss treatment, in males with AGA.
Potential Benefits of Caffeine for Hair
Caffeine may have a few advantages for your hair, including:
Hair loss
: Caffeine used topically can help with hair loss, thickening, and strengthening. Caffeine can help reduce DHT, the hormone that causes hair loss. In one study, topical caffeine was found to be just as effective as
minoxidil
, a drug-based treatment, in addressing hair loss in men with AGA.
Hair health
: Caffeine contains flavonoids, which are antioxidants that can protect the hair and scalp from environmental stressors like
UV
radiation and pollution. Caffeine can also help reduce
frizz
, make hair smoother, shinier, and healthier, and improve moisture retention.
Blood circulation
: Caffeine can improve blood circulation, allowing nutrients to reach the hair roots, resulting in healthier, shinier hair.
Caffeine in Hair Care Products
Shampoos
: Caffeine shampoos are designed to be used regularly. They cleanse the scalp and enable caffeine into the hair follicles. Examples include Trigaine Caffeine Shampoo and Hwash Caffeine Shampoo.
Conditioners
: Caffeine
conditioners
combine with shampoo to provide moisture and nourishment to the hair and scalp. Examples include Ora Expert (TH) Hair Thickening Conditioner and Hair 4U Conditioner.
Scalp Treatments and Serums
: These concentrated preparations are administered directly to the scalp, maximizing caffeine absorption. Examples include WishCare Hair Growth Serum Concentrate
Promoting Hair Growth with Caffeine
Caffeine can increase hair growth by increasing hair follicles and keratin production. Caffeine can cause matrix cells, which are found in hair follicles, to divide more quickly, resulting in faster hair growth. Caffeine can also inhibit the action of the hormone Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in hair follicles, resulting in increased hair loss.
Caffeine’s Role in Scalp Health
In numerous ways, caffeine can enhance the health of hair, such as:
Hair growth
: Caffeine can promote hair growth from the roots by inhibiting the hormone DHT, which causes hair loss. It also stimulates hair cells to produce more ATP, a type of energy that promotes hair growth.
Blood circulation
: Caffeine can increase blood flow to the scalp, which promotes healthy hair follicles.
Nutrients and vitamins
: Caffeine can provide nutrients and vitamins to hair, allowing it to grow longer and stronger.
Antioxidants
: Caffeine contains flavonoids, which are
antioxidants
that can protect the hair and scalp from environmental damage, such as UV rays and pollution.
Frizz and shine
: Caffeine can help reduce frizz and make hair softer, shinier, and healthier. It also helps to retain moisture by not stripping away the natural oils.
Managing Hair Loss and Caffeine Consumption
Caffeine can encourage hair growth and help with hair loss. Research indicates that caffeine can:
Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the hormone to target because it can impede the growth of hair by preventing the follicles from absorbing nutrients.
Extend the growth phase of hair follicles: Caffeine can expand hair follicles.
Caffeine contains antioxidants known as flavonoids, which can protect hair from pollution and UV rays.
Caffeine can make hair softer, shinier, and healthier, which helps reduce frizz.
Caffeine can help your hair retain moisture, making it shinier and healthier.

Balancing Caffeine Intake
Several pointers to moderate your caffeine intake:
Be aware
: Observe how much caffeine you get from food and beverages, especially energy drinks. Read labels carefully to see if over-the-counter pain relievers contain caffeine.
Cut back gradually
: Consider drinking a smaller cup of coffee or one fewer can of soda per day. You can also avoid drinking caffeinated beverages late in the day.
Go for decaf
: The majority of decaf beverages resemble their caffeinated counterparts in both taste and appearance. Using herbal tea or reducing the brew time are other options.
Before going to bed, avoid caffeine
: Try to avoid caffeine at least eight hours before bedtime as it can make it more difficult to fall asleep.
Exercise
: You can cut back on your caffeine intake and stay awake by going for quick runs or walks. They may also aid in boosting energy and reducing caffeine cravings.
Stay hydrated
: One way to lessen the jitters from too much coffee is to drink enough water. You may want to consider drinking an additional glass of water with each cup of coffee you prepare, as dehydration can intensify the effects of caffeine and prolong their duration.
Limit alcohol consumption
: Alcohol can slow your body's ability to break down caffeine, increasing its effects and side effects.
When to Seek Professional Advice
Most healthy persons tend to tolerate up to 400 milligrammes (mg) of caffeine per day. That's roughly the caffeine content of four cups of brewed coffee, ten cans of cola, or two "energy shot" drinks. Keep in mind that caffeine levels in beverages vary greatly, particularly in energy drinks.
