<p><span>Succinic acid is becoming increasingly popular in skincare, notably for acne treatment, due to several beneficial characteristics. This blog will provide a more in-depth understanding of how succinic acid benefits acne.</span></p>
<h3><b>What Is Succinic Acid?</b></h3>
<div><img alt="What Is Succinic Acid?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/What_Is_Succinic_Acid_480x480.jpg?v=1725105441"/></div>
<p><span>Succinic acid is a naturally occurring chemical in both amber (also known as the spirit of amber) and living organisms. It can also be manufactured; however, the techniques used are frequently hazardous to the environment.  Succinic acid is widely used in the food and beverage sector as an acidity regulator. Still, it is also employed in the pharmaceutical industry to control acidity or as a counterion. Some foods already contain succinic acid, such as broccoli and rhubarb, which have been praised for their health advantages. </span></p>
<h3><b>How Does Succinic Acid Combat Acne?</b></h3>
<div><img alt="How Does Succinic Acid Combat Acne?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/How_Does_Succinic_Acid_Combat_Acne_480x480.jpg?v=1725105442"/></div>
<p><span>Understandably, many individuals are scared off by the phrase 'acid', which conjures up images of peeling irritated skin. Fortunately, this is not the case when using succinic acid on the skin. Succinic acid is commonly used in cosmetics to cure blemishes. Individual product formulations vary, but a succinic acid acne treatment can typically be taken daily if not many times each day.  Instead of putting a coating over the entire face, a small amount of the acne treatment cream should be dotted onto specific parts of the skin where you are experiencing acne. </span></p>
<h3><b>The Science Behind Succinic Acid's Acne-Fighting Properties</b></h3>
<div><img alt="The Science Behind Succinic Acid's Acne-Fighting Properties" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/The_Science_Behind_Succinic_Acid_s_Acne-Fighting_Properties_480x480.jpg?v=1725105442"/></div>
<p><span>In living things, succinic acid exists as the anion succinate, which performs several biological tasks. These include functioning as a signaling molecule and as a metabolic intermediate that is changed into fumarate by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase in complex 2 of the electron transport chain, which is involved in the synthesis of ATP.</span></p>

<h2><b>Benefits of Succinic Acid for Acne-Prone Skin</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Benefits of Succinic Acid for Acne-Prone Skin" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Benefits_of_Succinic_Acid_for_Acne-Prone_Skin_480x480.jpg?v=1725105442"/></div>
<p><span>The benefits of succinic acid are primarily focused on acne treatment, but it can be used for other purposes as well.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Helps to regulate sebum production</b><span>: While sebum is a substance produced by the skin to keep it moisturized and protected, too much sebum can cause various skin problems, including acne.  Excess sebum can <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/open-pores">clog pores</a>, trapping microorganisms. Succinic acid regulates excess sebum production, making pores less likely to clog and trap acne-causing bacteria. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Accelerates cell renewal</b><span>: Skin cell renewal is critical for healthy, beautiful skin.  Skin cells regenerate, revealing the healthy cells beneath. This is an extremely important aspect of acne treatment that is frequently overlooked. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Effective antibacterial agent</b><span>: One of the reasons succinic acid is such a successful acne treatment is because of its antimicrobial properties.  This indicates that the growth of bacteria, viruses, and fungi is inhibited by succinic acid.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Aids in skin soothing</b><span>: Succinic acid, an anti-inflammatory, relieves red, irritated skin brought on by acne flare-ups.  Succinic acid, a popular topical blemish treatment, can soothe skin that is prone to breakouts in addition to helping to stop the accumulation of bacteria that cause acne.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>restores the pH balance of the skin</b><span>: pH, as you may remember from science class, is a measurement of a substance's acidity.  On a scale of 0 to 14, a low pH indicates an acidic substance, a pH of 7 is neutral (the pH of pure water), and a high pH indicates an alkaline substance. Succinic acid is a mild acid that helps to restore the skin's natural pH balance and flora.  </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Is an effective antioxidant</b><span>: Free radicals harm the skin by inducing the destruction of healthy atoms. The body produces some free radicals, but pollution, UVB radiation from the sun, and tobacco can all trigger free radicals that injure the skin.  <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/antioxidants">Antioxidants</a> inhibit oxidation, which produces free radicals. Antioxidant compounds, such as succinic acid, help to combat free radical damage by binding to them and eliminating the missing electron pairing that causes them to break up healthy atoms.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Reducing Inflammation and Redness</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Reducing Inflammation and Redness" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Reducing_Inflammation_and_Redness_480x480.jpg?v=1725105442"/></div>
<p><span>Succinic acid, which is commonly used in skincare for its exfoliating and antibacterial properties, can occasionally cause inflammation and redness, especially in people with <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/sensitive-skin">sensitive skin</a>. To reduce these side effects, perform a patch test, begin slowly, moisturize, use anti-inflammatory medications, hydration, sun protection, gentle washing, avoid overuse, and consult a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">dermatologist</a>. By following these steps, you can reduce the inflammation and redness caused by succinic acid while still reaping its skincare benefits.</span></p>
<h4><b>Regulating Oil Production</b></h4>
<p><span>Succinic acid, with its antibacterial and exfoliating properties, can aid in regulating oil production in the skin. To optimize its use for oil control while minimizing potential sensitivity, consider using appropriate formulations, introducing it gradually, consistency, complementary products, gentle cleansing, avoiding over-<a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/exfoliation%20">exfoliation</a>, sun protection, diet and hydration, and consulting a dermatologist. By following these steps, you can effectively use succinic acid to help regulate oil production and maintain clearer, healthier skin.</span></p>
<h4><b>Preventing Acne Scarring</b></h4>
<p><span>Succinic acid's ability to accelerate skin cell regeneration may help with scar appearance. However, it is more effective at preventing acne scars from developing in the first place.</span></p>
<h3><b>Incorporating Succinic Acid into Your Skincare Routine</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Incorporating Succinic Acid into Your Skincare Routine" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Incorporating_Succinic_Acid_into_Your_Skincare_Routine_480x480.jpg?v=1725105442"/></div>
