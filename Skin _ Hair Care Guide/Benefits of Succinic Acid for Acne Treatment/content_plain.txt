Succinic acid has received attention for its possible benefits in treating acne, but research is ongoing. This blog discusses the potential benefits of succinic acid for acne.
Understanding Succinic Acid: What Makes It Effective for Acne
Succinic acid is becoming increasingly popular in skincare, notably for acne treatment, due to several beneficial characteristics. This blog will provide a more in-depth understanding of how succinic acid benefits acne.
What Is Succinic Acid?
Succinic acid is a naturally occurring chemical in both amber (also known as the spirit of amber) and living organisms. It can also be manufactured; however, the techniques used are frequently hazardous to the environment.  Succinic acid is widely used in the food and beverage sector as an acidity regulator. Still, it is also employed in the pharmaceutical industry to control acidity or as a counterion. Some foods already contain succinic acid, such as broccoli and rhubarb, which have been praised for their health advantages.
How Does Succinic Acid Combat Acne?
Understandably, many individuals are scared off by the phrase 'acid', which conjures up images of peeling irritated skin. Fortunately, this is not the case when using succinic acid on the skin. Succinic acid is commonly used in cosmetics to cure blemishes. Individual product formulations vary, but a succinic acid acne treatment can typically be taken daily if not many times each day.  Instead of putting a coating over the entire face, a small amount of the acne treatment cream should be dotted onto specific parts of the skin where you are experiencing acne.
The Science Behind Succinic Acid's Acne-Fighting Properties
In living things, succinic acid exists as the anion succinate, which performs several biological tasks. These include functioning as a signaling molecule and as a metabolic intermediate that is changed into fumarate by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase in complex 2 of the electron transport chain, which is involved in the synthesis of ATP.
Benefits of Succinic Acid for Acne-Prone Skin
The benefits of succinic acid are primarily focused on acne treatment, but it can be used for other purposes as well.
Helps to regulate sebum production
: While sebum is a substance produced by the skin to keep it moisturized and protected, too much sebum can cause various skin problems, including acne.  Excess sebum can
clog pores
, trapping microorganisms. Succinic acid regulates excess sebum production, making pores less likely to clog and trap acne-causing bacteria.
Accelerates cell renewal
: Skin cell renewal is critical for healthy, beautiful skin.  Skin cells regenerate, revealing the healthy cells beneath. This is an extremely important aspect of acne treatment that is frequently overlooked.
Effective antibacterial agent
: One of the reasons succinic acid is such a successful acne treatment is because of its antimicrobial properties.  This indicates that the growth of bacteria, viruses, and fungi is inhibited by succinic acid.
Aids in skin soothing
: Succinic acid, an anti-inflammatory, relieves red, irritated skin brought on by acne flare-ups.  Succinic acid, a popular topical blemish treatment, can soothe skin that is prone to breakouts in addition to helping to stop the accumulation of bacteria that cause acne.
restores the pH balance of the skin
: pH, as you may remember from science class, is a measurement of a substance's acidity.  On a scale of 0 to 14, a low pH indicates an acidic substance, a pH of 7 is neutral (the pH of pure water), and a high pH indicates an alkaline substance. Succinic acid is a mild acid that helps to restore the skin's natural pH balance and flora.
Is an effective antioxidant
: Free radicals harm the skin by inducing the destruction of healthy atoms. The body produces some free radicals, but pollution, UVB radiation from the sun, and tobacco can all trigger free radicals that injure the skin.
Antioxidants
inhibit oxidation, which produces free radicals. Antioxidant compounds, such as succinic acid, help to combat free radical damage by binding to them and eliminating the missing electron pairing that causes them to break up healthy atoms.
Reducing Inflammation and Redness
Succinic acid, which is commonly used in skincare for its exfoliating and antibacterial properties, can occasionally cause inflammation and redness, especially in people with
sensitive skin
. To reduce these side effects, perform a patch test, begin slowly, moisturize, use anti-inflammatory medications, hydration, sun protection, gentle washing, avoid overuse, and consult a
dermatologist
. By following these steps, you can reduce the inflammation and redness caused by succinic acid while still reaping its skincare benefits.
Regulating Oil Production
Succinic acid, with its antibacterial and exfoliating properties, can aid in regulating oil production in the skin. To optimize its use for oil control while minimizing potential sensitivity, consider using appropriate formulations, introducing it gradually, consistency, complementary products, gentle cleansing, avoiding over-
exfoliation
, sun protection, diet and hydration, and consulting a dermatologist. By following these steps, you can effectively use succinic acid to help regulate oil production and maintain clearer, healthier skin.
Preventing Acne Scarring
Succinic acid's ability to accelerate skin cell regeneration may help with scar appearance. However, it is more effective at preventing acne scars from developing in the first place.
Incorporating Succinic Acid into Your Skincare Routine
Because of its tiny molecular size, Succinic Acid works best in treatment-style products, such as Succinic Acid Treatment, which targets specific locations. The product is ideal for applying blemishes to
cleanse
and reduce irritation, with a non-drying cream texture. Succinic Acid Treatment also helps to prevent clogged pores, making skin less blemish-prone in the long run.
In addition to 2% Succinic Acid, the strong treatment contains 2% sulphur and 1% Salicylic Acid for a three-pronged approach that successfully eliminates spots and reduces total oil production. So, how should you utilize this product in your routine, and how does it fit in? Our therapy is intended to be used in the morning and evening, anytime blemishes arise, and is best applied after cleansing and using
Hyaluronic Acid Serum
, but before
eye cream
,
moisturizer
, and SPF. It should be applied to the affected area with your fingertips right away before it begins to work its magic. It can also be used under makeup because of its cream texture; however, we recommend allowing approximately 5 minutes for the product to dry first.
The proper way to incorporate Succinic Acid into your routine is to cleanse, hydrate, treat, moisturize, and apply
sunscreen
. It is important to note that this treatment can be used up to three times per day and is naturally green due to the chlorophyll-derived plant pigment.
Choosing the Right Succinic Acid Product
Choosing the best succinic acid product for your skin requires careful consideration of several criteria, including your skin type, specific skin concerns, and the product's formulation. Some ideas for choosing the best succinic acid product include identifying your skin type, determining your skin concerns, checking the concentration, formulation type, ingredient list, brand reputation, patch testing, and consulting a dermatologist. By taking all of these factors into account, you may choose the best succinic acid product for your skin, allowing you to obtain the results you want while minimizing irritation.
How to Use Succinic Acid Safely and Effectively
Apply a small amount of Succinic Acid from the tube to a clean finger and then immediately to the blemish. If you want to add any skincare or makeup on top, let the formula dry for 5 minutes beforehand. Apply SPF as the final step in your morning skincare routine.
Potential Side Effects and Precautions
While succinic acid is generally safe and effective for many skin types, it can have certain negative effects, especially when taken incorrectly. Here are some potential negative effects and precautions to take:
Side effects may include irritation, redness,
dry skin
, peeling, breakouts, and increased sensitivity.
Precautions include patch testing, starting slowly, moisturizing, sun protection, avoiding other exfoliants, hydrating, consulting a dermatologist, following instructions, and monitoring skin reactions.
