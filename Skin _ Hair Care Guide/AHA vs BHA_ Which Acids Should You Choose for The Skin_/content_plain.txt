AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) and BHA (beta hydroxy acid) are two types of exfoliating acids commonly used in skincare products to improve skin texture and appearance. While both acids can provide similar benefits, there are some differences in their properties and the types of skin concerns they are best suited for.
AHA is water-soluble and primarily exfoliates the surface of the skin, making it an excellent choice for people with dry or sun-damaged skin. AHA is commonly found in products like glycolic acid, lactic acid, and mandelic acid. It can help improve skin texture, reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and enhance skin radiance.
On the other hand, BHA is oil-soluble and can penetrate deeper into the pores, making it an ideal choice for people with oily or acne-prone skin. BHA is commonly found in salicylic acid, which can help
exfoliate
and unclog pores, reduce inflammation, and
treat
acne
.
Overall, the choice between AHA and BHA depends on your skin type and specific skin concerns. If you have dry or sun-damaged skin, you may benefit more from using an AHA, while those with
oily
or
acne-prone
skin may benefit from using a BHA. It's also important to note that both acids can increase skin sensitivity to the sun, so it's essential to use sunscreen daily when incorporating them into your
skincare
routine.
What are AHAs and BHAs?
AHAs and BHAs are both types of chemical exfoliants that are commonly used in skincare products.
AHAs, or alpha-hydroxy acids, are water-soluble acids that work by breaking down the bonds between dead skin cells, allowing them to be easily sloughed off. Some common AHAs include
glycolic acid
, lactic acid, and
mandelic acid
. AHAs are often used to improve the texture and tone of the skin, reduce the appearance of
fine lines and
wrinkles
, and lighten hyperpigmentation.
BHAs, or beta-hydroxy acids, are oil-soluble acids that are able to penetrate deep into the pores of the skin.
Salicylic acid
is the most commonly used BHA in skincare products. BHAs work by dissolving the sebum that can clog pores and cause acne, making them particularly effective for treating oily or acne-prone skin.
Both
AHAs and BHAs
can be effective in improving the overall appearance and health of the skin. However, it's important to use them correctly and to choose products that are appropriate for your skin type and concerns. It's also important to use sunscreen when using AHAs or BHAs, as they can increase skin sensitivity to the sun.
Understanding skin types and acid choices
Understanding skin types and the appropriate acid choices is essential for effective skincare. Here's a breakdown:
Skin Types
:
Balanced skin with few imperfections, minimal sensitivity, and well-moisturized. It's important to maintain this balance with gentle, hydrating products.
Lacks moisture and can feel tight or flaky. Look for products containing hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid and avoid harsh cleansers or exfoliants that can further strip moisture.
Overproduction of sebum, leads to a shiny complexion and an increased risk of acne. Opt for oil-free, non-comedogenic products, and use gentle exfoliants to unclog pores.
A mix of oily and dry areas, often with an oily
T-zone
(forehead, nose, and chin) and dry cheeks. Use products that address both concerns, such as a gentle cleanser and targeted treatments for specific areas.
Prone to redness, irritation, and allergic reactions. Choose fragrance-free, hypoallergenic products with soothing ingredients like aloe vera or chamomile, and patch-test new products before applying them to your face.
Acid Choices
:
Ideal for all skin types,
hyaluronic acid
is a humectant that attracts and retains moisture, helping to plump and hydrate the skin.
A type of alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) derived from sugar cane, glycolic acid exfoliates the skin, improving texture, tone, and brightness. It suits normal to oily skin types but may be too harsh for sensitive or dry skin.
Another AHA, lactic acid is gentler than glycolic acid and is well-tolerated by most skin types. It exfoliates and hydrates the skin, making it suitable for dry or sensitive skin.
beta hydroxy acid (BHA) that penetrates deep into pores to unclog them and prevent acne. Salicylic acid is best for oily or acne-prone skin but may be too drying for dry or sensitive skin types.
Effective for treating acne and
rosacea
,
azelaic acid
has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. It's suitable for most skin types but may irritate some individuals.
Ideal for all skin types, hyaluronic acid is a humectant that attracts and retains moisture, helping to plump and hydrate the skin.
A gentle AHA derived from bitter almonds, mandelic acid exfoliates the skin and targets hyperpigmentation. It's suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin.
The science behind AHA and BHA effectiveness
Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) are chemical exfoliants that are widely used in skincare products due to their ability to improve skin texture, tone, and overall appearance. The science behind their effectiveness stems from their ability to promote
exfoliation
and cell turnover, albeit through slightly different mechanisms.
Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs)
:
AHAs, such as glycolic acid and lactic acid, are water-soluble acids derived from fruits and milk sugars. They work primarily by loosening the bonds between dead skin cells on the skin's surface, promoting exfoliation and revealing newer, fresher skin underneath. AHAs also have humectant properties, meaning they can attract moisture to the skin, helping to hydrate and plump the skin. Additionally, AHAs can stimulate collagen production, leading to firmer and more elastic skin over time.
Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHAs)
: Salicylic acid is the most common BHA used in skincare products. Unlike AHAs, BHAs are lipid-soluble, which means they can penetrate the pores of the skin. BHAs work by exfoliating the inside of the pores, dissolving excess oil, and unclogging pores. This makes them particularly effective for treating acne and
blackheads
. BHAs also have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help reduce redness and irritation associated with acne and other skin conditions.
Benefits of AHAs for skin exfoliation
Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) are popular ingredients in skincare products due to their numerous skin-exfoliating benefits. Here are some of the main advantages of AHAs.
Exfoliation
: AHAs are water-soluble acids that loosen and remove the top layer of dead skin cells, promoting cell turnover and revealing smoother, brighter skin beneath. This exfoliation process improves skin texture, reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and evens out skin tone.
Improves Skin Tone and Texture
: Regular AHA use can help improve skin tone and texture by reducing roughness, unevenness, and dullness. AHAs help to refine the skin's surface, making it appear smoother, softer, and more radiant.
Stimulates Collagen Production
: AHAs have been shown to increase collagen production in the skin, which can help improve skin elasticity and firmness over time. This can lead to a more youthful appearance and may help reduce the visible signs of aging, such as fine lines and wrinkles.
Reduces Hyperpigmentation
: AHAs can help fade dark spots, sun spots, and other types of hyperpigmentation by promoting the shedding of pigmented skin cells and the formation of new, evenly pigmented cells. This can lead to a more even, radiant complexion.
Increases Skincare Product Absorption
: By exfoliating the skin's surface, AHAs can help improve the absorption and efficacy of subsequent skincare products. This improves the penetration of active ingredients such as
antioxidants
, vitamins, and moisturisers, maximising their benefits to the skin.
Helps Unclog Pores
: AHAs can penetrate the pores and dissolve excess oil, dirt, and debris, thereby unclogging them and preventing acne breakouts. Regular use of AHAs can help keep pores clear and reduce the likelihood of blemishes and blackheads.
Improves Skin Barrier Function
: AHAs exfoliate the skin's outer layer while also stimulating the production of ceramides and other lipids, which help maintain the skin's natural moisture barrier. This can boost overall skin health and resilience, making it more resistant to environmental damage and irritation.
AHA vs BHA
AHA (Alpha Hydroxy Acids) and BHA (Beta Hydroxy Acids) are both types of exfoliants commonly used in skincare. While they have similar functions, there are some differences between the two.
AHA is a water-soluble acid that works on the surface of the skin to dissolve dead skin cells, revealing a brighter, smoother complexion. Common types of AHAs include glycolic acid, lactic acid, and mandelic acid. AHAs are typically recommended for those with dry,
sun-damaged
, or aging skin.
BHA is oil-soluble, which means it can penetrate deeper into the pores to dissolve oil and dead skin cells. This makes it particularly effective for those with oily or acne-prone skin. The most common type of BHA used in skincare is salicylic acid.
In summary, AHA is best for surface-level exfoliation and improving skin texture, while BHA is better for deep cleaning pores and reducing oiliness. Both can be effective in improving skin tone and reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It's important to note that both AHAs and BHAs can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, so it's essential to wear
sunscreen
daily.
BHAs for acne-prone skin
Beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), particularly salicylic acid, have unique properties that make them extremely beneficial for acne-prone skin. Here's how BHAs work and what benefits they have for acne-prone skin:
BHAs are oil-soluble, which means they can enter the pores of the skin. This property enables BHAs to efficiently dissolve excess oil (sebum) and dead skin cells, which can clog pores and cause acne breakouts. By unclogging pores, BHAs aid in the prevention of new acne lesions.
Unlike AHAs, which primarily exfoliate the skin's surface, BHAs penetrate deep into the pores. They exfoliate the pore lining, removing debris and preventing comedones (white and blackheads). This makes BHAs especially effective at treating and preventing non-inflammatory acne, such as blackheads and whiteheads.
BHAs have anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce the redness, swelling, and irritation caused by inflammatory acne lesions like papules, pustules, and cysts. By reducing inflammation, BHAs can make acne-prone skin appear and feel calmer and less irritated.
Salicylic acid, the most commonly used BHA in skincare products, is also mildly antibacterial. It can help to inhibit the growth of acne-causing bacteria like Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), which reduces the likelihood of acne breakouts.
In addition to treating acne, BHAs can improve the skin's texture and tone. BHAs help to smooth rough skin, refine pores, and fade post-acne marks and discoloration, making the skin appear clearer and more even-toned.
When using BHAs on acne-prone skin, it is critical to select products with the appropriate salicylic acid concentration and to use them as directed. Starting with lower concentrations and gradually increasing frequency can help reduce the risk of irritation, particularly for those with sensitive skin. Furthermore, combining BHAs with other acne-fighting ingredients, such as benzoyl peroxide or retinoids, can improve their efficacy in acne treatment.
AHA and BHA for anti-aging
Both alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) provide anti-aging benefits to the skin, albeit via slightly different mechanisms. Here's how AHAs and BHAs can help with anti-aging skincare:
AHAs for Anti-Aging
:
AHAs, such as glycolic acid and lactic acid, exfoliate the skin and increase cell turnover. By removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin, AHAs help to reveal newer, fresher skin underneath. This can improve the texture and tone of the skin, giving it a smoother, more radiant appearance.
Regular use of AHA exfoliants can help to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. By stimulating cell turnover, AHAs encourage the production of new collagen and elastin, which are essential proteins for maintaining skin firmness and elasticity. This can help to reduce the depth of wrinkles and fine lines, resulting in a more youthful appearance.
AHAs have humectant properties, which means they attract moisture to the skin. This hydrates the skin, increases moisture retention, and reduces dryness and flakiness. Hydrated skin appears plumper and smoother, which can help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
AHAs can also improve skin tone by reducing hyperpigmentation, age spots, and sun damage. By promoting exfoliation and increasing cell turnover, AHAs encourage the removal of discolored or damaged skin cells, revealing a more uniform complexion.
BHAs for Anti-Aging
:
BHAs, like salicylic acid, work deep within the pores to exfoliate the skin and remove excess oil, dead skin cells, and other debris. By unclogging pores and preventing the formation of blackheads and whiteheads, BHAs help to improve the overall clarity and smoothness of the skin.
BHAs have anti-inflammatory properties that can help to reduce the redness, swelling, and irritation associated with ageing skin. This can be especially useful for people with sensitive or rosacea-prone skin.
BHAs help to prevent acne breakouts, which can be an issue for people with mature skin. By keeping the pores clear and reducing excess oil production, BHAs can minimize the occurrence of blemishes and maintain a clear, youthful complexion.
When incorporating AHAs and BHAs into an anti-aging skincare routine, it is critical to begin with lower concentrations and gradually increase usage to avoid irritation, particularly for those with sensitive skin. Furthermore, wearing sunscreen daily is essential when using exfoliating acids, as they can increase skin sensitivity to the sun and the risk of sunburn.
AHA and BHA for sensitive skin
For people with sensitive skin, incorporating alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) into their skincare routine takes careful consideration and, in some cases, trial and error to find the right products and concentrations that work well without irritating. Here are some guidelines for using AHAs and BHAs with sensitive skin:
Begin with Lower Concentrations
: To reduce irritation, start with products that contain lower concentrations of AHAs or BHAs. Look for products with concentrations of about 5% or less. Starting slowly allows your skin to gradually adjust to the exfoliating properties of these acids.
Patch Test
: Before using AHAs or BHAs on your entire face, conduct a patch test on a small area of skin to check for any adverse reactions or sensitivity. Apply a small amount of the product to a discreet area, such as the inner forearm, and wait 24-48 hours to see if redness, itching, or irritation develops.
Use Products Sparingly
: Limit the frequency of use, especially initially. Begin by using AHAs or BHAs a few times per week, gradually increasing as your skin tolerates them. For sensitive skin, it may be best to use these acids every other day, or even only a few times per week.
Choose Formulations Wisely
: Opt for gentle formulations that are specifically designed for sensitive skin.Look for fragrance-free, alcohol-free products infused with soothing ingredients such as aloe vera, chamomile, or green tea extract.
Consider pH Levels
: Pay close attention to the pH of the products you use. When AHAs and BHAs are formulated at the proper pH, they are most effective at exfoliating the skin. Look for products with a pH of 3 to 4, as this range maximises exfoliating benefits while minimising irritation.
Apply Moisturiser and Sunscreen Next
: To help calm and hydrate the skin, apply a moisturiser next to AHAs or BHAs. Furthermore, because AHAs and BHAs can exacerbate sun sensitivity and raise the risk of sunburn, use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher at all times during the day.
Listen to Your Skin
: If you observe any signs of irritation, such as redness, burning, or stinging, reduce your frequency of use or stop altogether. Everybody has different skin, so listen to what your skin is telling you and modify your skincare regimen accordingly.
By taking these precautions and being aware of your skin's sensitivity, you can enjoy the benefits of AHAs and BHAs without causing too much irritation or discomfort. If you are unsure about which products or concentrations are best for your sensitive skin, consult a
dermatologist
for personalised advice.
How to incorporate AHA BHA in your skincare routine
AHA (alpha hydroxy acids) and BHA (beta hydroxy acids) are common exfoliants found in skincare products. Including them in your skincare routine can help improve the texture and appearance of your skin by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, and minimising the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Here's how to include AHA and BHA in your skincare routine:
Start slowly
: If you're new to AHA & BHA, start by using a product with a lower concentration once a week and gradually increase the frequency and concentration as your skin gets used to it. Overusing AHA BHA products can cause irritation and dryness, so it's essential to be patient and introduce them slowly.
Choose the right product
: There are many AHA & BHA products available in the market, including toners, serums, and masks. Choose a product that suits your skin type and concerns. For example, if you have oily or acne-prone skin, a BHA product may be more beneficial as it can penetrate deeper into the pores.
Use them at the right time
: AHA & BHA products are best used in the evening, as they can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Apply them after cleansing and toning, and before moisturizing.
Don't mix them with other exfoliants
: Avoid using AHA & BHA products with other exfoliants, such as scrubs or physical exfoliants. Using them together can cause irritation and damage to the skin.
Protect your skin
: As AHA & BHA products can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, it's essential to wear sunscreen during the day to protect your skin from
UV damage
.
Remember, everyone's skin is different, so it's essential to listen to your skin and adjust your routine accordingly. If you experience any irritation or discomfort, reduce the frequency or concentration of the AHA & BHA product or stop using it altogether.
How often to use AHA and BHA
The frequency of AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) and BHA (beta hydroxy acid) use is determined by a variety of factors, including your skin type, tolerance, product concentration, and specific skincare goals. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide how frequently to use AHAs and BHAs:
Start Slowly
: If you are new to using AHAs or BHAs, you should start slowly to give your skin time to adjust to these exfoliating acids. Start by applying them once or twice a week to see how your skin reacts.
Gradually Increase Frequency
: Once your skin has adjusted and you are not experiencing irritation, you can gradually increase the frequency of application. Depending on your skin's tolerance, you may be able to use AHAs or BHAs every other day, if not daily.
Consider Product Concentration
: The concentration of AHAs and BHAs in your skincare products also influences how frequently you can use them. Higher concentrations may necessitate less frequent use, whereas lower concentrations may be sufficient for daily use.
Listen to Your Skin
: Pay attention to how your skin responds to AHAs and BHAs. If you notice any signs of irritation, such as redness, burning, or excessive dryness, reduce the frequency of use or take a break from the product until your skin calms down.
Alternate AHAs and BHAs
: Some people find it beneficial to alternate between AHAs and BHAs in their skincare routine. For example, you might use an AHA product one day and a BHA product the next day to reap the benefits of both types of exfoliants while minimizing the risk of overexfoliation.
Adjust Based on Season
: Your skin's needs may vary depending on the season. For example, you may need to use AHAs and BHAs more frequently during the summer months when oil production tends to increase, or you may need to reduce frequency during the winter when the skin is more prone to dryness.
Use Sun Protection
: Regardless of how often you use AHAs or BHAs, it's essential to use sunscreen daily, especially during the daytime. AHAs and BHAs can increase the skin's sensitivity to the sun, so wearing sunscreen helps protect your skin from sun damage and reduces the risk of irritation.
Best practices for applying AHA and BHA
A few best practices must be followed when applying alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) to ensure safe and efficient use. Here's how to incorporate BHAs and AHAs into your skincare regimen:
Cleanse Your Skin
: Start with clean skin. Use a gentle
cleanser
to remove makeup, dirt, and impurities from your skin. Pat your skin dry with a clean towel before applying AHAs or BHAs.
Use on Dry Skin
: AHAs and BHAs work best on dry skin. Wait a few minutes after cleansing to ensure that your skin is completely dry before using these exfoliants.
Apply a Small Amount
: Place a small amount of the AHA or BHA product on your fingertips or a cotton pad. You do not need to saturate your skin with the product; a thin, even layer is enough.
Start with a Patch Test
: If you are using AHAs or BHAs for the first time or trying out a new product, you should run a patch test. Apply a small amount of the product to a discreet area of skin, such as the inner forearm, and wait 24-48 hours for any adverse reactions before using it on your face.
Apply evenly
: Gently massage or pat the AHA or BHA product into your skin, concentrating on problem areas such as the face, neck, chest, or back. Avoid the delicate skin around the eyes and lips, which may be more sensitive to exfoliating acids.
Wait for Absorption
: Allow the AHA or BHA product to penetrate your skin before applying any additional skincare products. This usually takes a few minutes. Rinsing off the product is not recommended unless specifically stated in the product's instructions.
Apply a moisturiser next
: To help hydrate and calm your skin, apply a moisturiser after the AHA or BHA product has absorbed. If you use AHAs or BHAs, you should moisturise even more because they can occasionally cause dryness or irritation.
Use Sunscreen
: When using AHAs and BHAs, especially after exfoliating, it is important to reapply sunscreen every day because these acids can make the skin more sensitive to the sun. Throughout the day, reapply a broad-spectrum sunscreen as needed, preferably with an SPF of 30 or higher.
Start Slowly and Gradually Increase Frequency
: If you're new to using AHAs or BHAs, start with a lower concentration and use them less frequently to allow your skin to acclimatise. You can gradually increase the frequency and concentration as your skin tolerates it.
Listen to Your Skin
: Pay attention to how your skin responds to AHAs and BHAs. If you experience any redness, irritation, or other adverse reactions, reduce the frequency of use or stop completely. Everyone's skin is different, so tailor your skincare routine to your specific needs and tolerance.
By following these best practices, you can incorporate AHAs and BHAs into your skincare routine effectively and safely, thereby improving the texture, tone, and overall health of your skin.
Combining AHA and BHA with other skincare ingredients
Combining alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) with other skincare ingredients can improve their efficacy and provide overall skin benefits. Here's how to mix AHAs and BHAs with other skincare ingredients:
Hyaluronic Acid
: Hyaluronic acid is a hydrating ingredient that helps to attract and retain moisture in the skin. It can be beneficial to use hyaluronic acid alongside AHAs and BHAs to help counteract any potential dryness or irritation caused by exfoliation. Look for moisturisers or serums that include both hyaluronic acid and AHAs/BHAs to hydrate and exfoliate the skin.
Antioxidants
:
Vitamins C
, E, and Niacinamide can help protect the skin from environmental damage and neutralise free radicals that cause premature ageing. Combining antioxidants with AHAs and BHAs can provide additional anti-aging benefits while also improving overall skin health. To achieve the best results, look for serums or moisturisers that contain both antioxidants and exfoliating acids.
Retinoids
: Retinoids, which include tretinoin and retinol, are potent anti-aging substances that help enhance skin texture, promote the production of
collagen
, and lessen the appearance of wrinkles. While retinoids and AHAs/BHAs can both exfoliate the skin, they can also irritate when used together. To avoid over-exfoliation, it's best to use retinoids and AHAs/BHAs on alternate nights or at different times of the day. Start with lower concentrations of both ingredients and gradually increase as your skin tolerates it.
Peptides
: Peptides are chains of amino acids that promote the synthesis of collagen and increase the suppleness of the skin. Combining peptides with AHAs and BHAs can improve the anti-aging effects of exfoliation by stimulating collagen synthesis and firming the skin. Look for serums or moisturisers that include peptides as well as AHAs/BHAs to get the most anti-aging benefits.
Sunscreen
: When using AHAs and BHAs, sunscreen is essential because these exfoliating acids can make the skin more sensitive to sunlight. Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher during the day, even if you are using AHAs or BHAs in the evening. This protects your skin from UV rays and prevents additional signs of ageing.
When combining AHAs and BHAs with other skincare ingredients, it is critical to introduce new products gradually and monitor your skin's reaction. Pay attention to any signs of irritation or sensitivity and modify your skincare regimen accordingly. Consulting with a dermatologist can also assist you in developing a personalised skincare regimen that addresses your specific concerns and objectives.
Maximizing Benefits: AHA and BHA in Skincare
To reap the most benefits from alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) in skincare, they must be used correctly and integrated into a comprehensive skincare regimen. Here are some tips for increasing the benefits of AHAs and BHAs:
Understand Your Skin Type and Concerns
: Before incorporating AHAs and BHAs into your skincare routine, you should first understand your skin type and specific concerns. AHAs are suitable for most skin types, but BHAs are especially beneficial for oily, acne-prone, or congested skin. Decide whether you want to address dullness, uneven texture, acne, or signs of ageing.
Choose the Right Products
: Look for skincare products with high concentrations of AHAs and BHAs. Choose products with stabilized formulations and the appropriate pH levels to ensure optimal efficacy. Consider the product's formulation (such as serum, toner, or exfoliating pad) as well as your skin's tolerance for different textures.
Start Slowly and Gradually Increase Frequency
: If you're new to using AHAs and BHAs, start with lower concentrations and use them less frequently to give your skin time to adjust. Begin by using them once or twice a week, gradually increasing the frequency as your skin tolerates them. This approach reduces the risk of irritation and overexfoliation.
Alternate AHAs and BHAs
: Some people find it beneficial to alternate AHAs and BHAs in their skincare routine. To get the most out of both types of exfoliants, you could use an AHA product one day and a BHA product the next. Alternating can help prevent over-exfoliation and provide overall skincare benefits.
Use Sunscreen Daily
: AHAs and BHAs can make the skin more sensitive to the sun, so use sunscreen every day, even if you aren't using exfoliating acids. Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, and reapply as needed during the day. Sunscreen protects your skin from UV rays and prevents further signs of ageing.
Consider Combination with Other Skincare Ingredients
: Combining AHAs and BHAs with other skincare ingredients such as antioxidants, peptides, and hydrating agents can increase their effectiveness. Look for skincare products that combine these ingredients to address multiple skin concerns while also providing comprehensive anti-aging benefits.
Listen to Your Skin
: Pay attention to how AHAs and BHAs affect your skin. If you notice any irritation, redness, or sensitivity, reduce your frequency of use or stop completely. Everyone's skin is different, so tailor your skincare routine to your specific needs and tolerance.
Layering AHA and BHA with sunscreen
When combining alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) with sunscreen, both products must be applied correctly to maximise their effectiveness and protect your skin from sun damage. Here's how to layer AHAs and BHAs with sunscreen:
Begin by using your AHA or BHA product on clean, dry skin. Wait a few minutes to allow the product to absorb fully into your skin before moving on to the next step. This ensures that the exfoliating acids have enough time to work their magic before applying sunscreen.
After using AHAs or BHAs, wait a few minutes before applying sunscreen. This allows the acids to effectively penetrate and exfoliate the skin without interference from other skincare products.
Apply a generous amount of sunscreen to your entire face, neck, and any other exposed areas of skin. Apply at least a quarter-size amount to your face alone. Make sure you massage the sunscreen into your skin until it is completely absorbed.
Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against UVA and UVB rays. To protect yourself from sun damage, choose a sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 30 or higher.
Reapply sunscreen every two hours, or more frequently if you are swimming or sweating. If you use AHAs or BHAs in the morning, remember to reapply sunscreen regularly to stay protected from the sun's harmful rays.
Some sunscreen formulations may not work well with certain skincare products. For example, chemical sunscreens may not be compatible with certain AHAs or BHAs, as they can cause irritation or decrease the effectiveness of the exfoliating acids. In such cases, consider using a physical (mineral) sunscreen instead.
AHAs and BHAs can increase the skin's sensitivity to the sun, so it's essential to be extra vigilant about sun protection when using these exfoliating acids. Take additional precautions to limit sun exposure, such as wearing protective clothing, seeking shade, and avoiding the sun during peak hours (10 am to 4 pm).
AHA and BHA for dark spots and hyperpigmentation
Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) both work to treat dark spots and hyperpigmentation, albeit through slightly different mechanisms. Here's how AHAs and BHAs can help with dark spots and hyperpigmentation:
AHAs for Dark Spots
:
AHAs, such as glycolic acid and lactic acid, work by exfoliating the skin's outer layer, increasing cell turnover and encouraging the shedding of dead skin cells. This exfoliation can help to reduce dark spots and hyperpigmentation by removing pigmented, damaged skin cells from the surface.
Additionally, AHAs can help improve skin texture and tone, making dark spots less visible over time. They also have humectant properties, which help to hydrate the skin and improve its overall appearance.
BHAs For Dark Spots
:
BHAs, like salicylic acid, are oil-soluble acids that can reach deep into the pores. This property makes BHAs especially effective at treating dark spots and hyperpigmentation caused by acne or clogged pores.
BHAs exfoliate the inside of the pores, removing dirt and excess oil that can cause dark spots and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. By unclogging pores and preventing new breakouts, BHAs help to reduce the risk of pigmentation.
Adjusting AHA and BHA concentrations for your skin
Adjusting the concentrations of alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) in your skincare products is critical for ensuring efficacy while reducing irritation risk, especially if you have sensitive skin. Here's how to adjust AHA and BHA concentrations for your skin:
Start with Lower Concentrations
: If you are new to using AHAs or BHAs, begin with products with lower concentrations to allow your skin to gradually adjust. Lower concentrations are less likely to irritate, making them a better choice for sensitive skin.
Assess Your Skin Tolerance
: Pay attention to how your skin reacts to AHAs and BHAs. If you notice redness, irritation, or stinging after using a product, it could mean that the concentration is too high for your skin. Consider switching to a low-concentration product or using it less frequently.
Gradually Increase Concentrations
: After your skin has adapted to lower concentrations, gradually increase the amount of AHAs or BHAs in your skincare products. To avoid over-exfoliation or irritation, carefully monitor your skin's response and make adjustments as needed.
Consider Product Formulations
: The product's formulation can influence how well your skin tolerates AHAs and BHAs. Leave-on treatments, like serums or creams, may be more effective than rinse-off products, such as cleansers or masks. Select formulations that address your skin type and concerns.
Use Products as Directed
: Follow the manufacturer's instructions for how often and how much product to use. Overuse of AHAs or BHAs can cause irritation and other side effects, so use them as directed.
Combine with Soothing Ingredients
: To reduce irritation, use products with soothing ingredients such as aloe vera, chamomile, or centella asiatica alongside AHAs or BHAs. These ingredients can help to soothe and hydrate the skin, lowering the risk of irritation.
Sun Sensitivity
: Because AHAs and BHAs can make the skin more sensitive to the sun, it is critical to use sunscreen every day, especially when using these exfoliating acids. Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, and reapply as needed during the day.
Adjusting AHA and BHA concentrations for your skin requires patience and careful monitoring of how it reacts. Starting with lower concentrations, gradually increasing as tolerated, and paying attention to your skin's needs will help you find the right balance to achieve the desired results without causing irritation or adverse effects. If you have any concerns or questions about adjusting AHA and BHA concentrations for your skin, see a dermatologist for personalised advice.
Navigating Challenges: AHA and BHA Use
Navigating the challenges of using alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) entails addressing potential issues such as irritation, sensitivity, and photosensitivity. Here's how to successfully navigate these challenges:

: If you are new to using AHAs or BHAs, begin with lower concentrations and less frequent use to allow your skin to gradually adjust. This can help to reduce the risk of irritation and sensitivity.
Patch Test
: Before using AHAs or BHAs on your entire face, conduct a patch test on a small area of skin to check for any adverse reactions or sensitivity. Wait 24-48 hours to see if there is any redness, itching, or irritation before applying the product more widely.
Monitor Skin Reaction
: Keep track of how your skin reacts to AHAs and BHAs. If you notice redness, stinging, burning, or excessive dryness, it could mean that the product is too harsh for your skin. Consider reducing the frequency of use or changing to a lower concentration.
Use Soothing Ingredients
: To reduce irritation and sensitivity, incorporate ingredients like aloe vera, chamomile, or centella asiatica into your skincare regimen. These ingredients can soothe and hydrate the skin, reducing the discomfort associated with AHA and BHA use.
Adjust Frequency and Concentration
: If you experience irritation or sensitivity, consider adjusting the frequency and concentration of AHAs or BHAs in your skincare routine. Use them less frequently or switch to products with lower concentrations to minimize potential adverse effects.
Protect Your Skin
: AHAs and BHAs can increase the skin's sensitivity to the sun, so it's crucial to use sunscreen daily, even on days when you're not using exfoliating acids. Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher and reapply as needed throughout the day.
Consider Alternate Forms
: If you find that traditional AHAs or BHAs are too harsh for your skin, consider using alternative forms such as polyhydroxy acids (PHAs) or azelaic acid. These exfoliating acids are generally gentler on the skin and may be better tolerated by sensitive skin types.
Consult a Dermatologist
: If you're struggling to navigate challenges with AHAs and BHAs use, consider consulting a dermatologist for personalized advice and recommendations. A dermatologist can help identify the underlying cause of your skin issues and provide tailored solutions to address them effectively.
Side effects of AHAs and BHAs
Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) are generally safe for most people when used as directed. However, like any other skincare ingredient, they can cause side effects, particularly when used incorrectly or in high concentrations. Here are some possible side effects of AHAs and BHAs:
Skin irritation is among the most common side effects of AHAs and BHAs. This can cause redness, stinging, burning, or itching, especially in people with sensitive skin or who use products with high acid concentrations.
AHAs and BHAs can disrupt the skin's moisture barrier, causing dryness and flakiness, especially if used for an extended period or excessively. This is more common in people with dry or sensitive skin.
Both AHAs and BHAs can increase the skin's sensitivity to the sun, making it more susceptible to sunburn and sun damage. This is why it's crucial to use sunscreen daily when using products containing AHAs or BHAs.
In some cases, AHAs and BHAs can cause increased photosensitivity, making the skin more reactive to sunlight and artificial light sources. This can lead to a higher risk of developing sunburn or skin discoloration with sun exposure.
When first starting AHAs or BHAs, some individuals may experience a temporary worsening of acne or breakouts. This is known as purging and occurs as the acids help to unclog pores and bring underlying impurities to the surface. Purging typically resolves on its own after a few weeks of consistent use.
In rare cases, AHAs and BHAs can cause temporary hyperpigmentation or darkening of the skin, especially in individuals with darker skin tones. This is more likely to occur with prolonged or excessive use of high-concentration products.
While rare, some individuals may experience allergic reactions to AHAs or BHAs, resulting in symptoms such as rash, hives, or swelling. If you experience any allergic reactions, discontinue use of the product immediately and consult a healthcare professional.
Precautions when using AHAs and BHAs
When using alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) in your skincare routine, you must take certain precautions to reduce the risk of side effects and ensure safe and effective application. Here are some safeguards to consider:
Start Slowly
: If you are new to using AHAs or BHAs, begin with products with lower concentrations and less frequent use to allow your skin to gradually adjust. This can help to reduce the risk of irritation and sensitivity.
Patch Tests
: Before using AHAs or BHAs on your entire face, conduct a patch test on a small area of skin, such as the inner forearm. This helps to determine whether you have any adverse reactions or are sensitive to the product.
Avoid Exfoliation
: Excessive use of AHAs or BHAs can cause irritation, dryness, and damage to the skin's moisture barrier. Avoid using multiple exfoliating products at the same time, and start with just once or twice a week, gradually increasing frequency as tolerated.
Use Sunscreen Daily
: AHAs and BHAs can make the skin more sensitive to the sun, increasing the risk of sunburn and damage. To protect your skin from harmful UV rays, apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher every day, even on cloudy days.
Avoid Combining with Certain Ingredients
: Some skincare ingredients, such as retinoids or vitamin C, can cause irritation or sensitivity when combined with AHAs or BHAs. If using multiple active ingredients in your skincare routine, consider alternating them or using them at different times of the day to minimize potential interactions.
Be Cautious with Sensitive Areas
: AHAs and BHAs can be too harsh for sensitive areas of the skin, such as the delicate skin around the eyes or lips. Avoid applying exfoliating acids to these areas to prevent irritation or damage.
Monitor Skin Reaction
: Pay close attention to how your skin reacts to AHA and BHAs. If you experience redness, stinging, burning, or excessive dryness, stop using it or reduce the frequency of your applications. If you have any concerns or are experiencing persistent side effects, consult a dermatologist.
Consider pH Levels
: AHAs and BHAs are most effective at exfoliating the skin when they are formulated at the proper pH level. To ensure maximum efficacy, choose products with pH levels ranging from 3 to 4.
Be patient
: AHAs and BHAs take time to produce results. Be patient and consistent in your skincare routine, and allow your skin to adjust to the exfoliating acids.
By taking these precautions when using AHAs and BHAs in your skincare routine, you can reduce your risk of side effects while reaping the benefits of exfoliation for smoother, brighter, and healthier-looking skin. If you have any concerns or questions about incorporating AHAs and BHAs into your skincare routine, see a dermatologist for personalised advice and recommendations.
Patch testing AHA and BHA products
Before applying alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) to your entire face, you should patch-test them to see how your skin reacts to these exfoliating ingredients. Here's how to patch-test AHA and BHA products: Select a small test area, cleanse it, apply a small amount of product to the test area, wait and observe, monitor for reactions, repeat as needed, and interpret the results. Before applying AHA and BHA products to your entire face, perform a patch test to detect any potential sensitivities or allergies and reduce the risk of adverse reactions. Patch testing is especially important if you have sensitive skin or are trying AHAs or BHAs for the first time. If you have any concerns or questions about patch testing or skincare ingredients, talk to your dermatologist for personalised advice and recommendations.
