<p><span>The science of Acacia Collagen resides in its distinct composition. It has a high concentration of polysaccharides, particularly galactose and rhamnose, which are known for their ability to bind water and soothe the skin. These components help to maintain moisture in the skin, resulting in a plumping effect that helps minimise the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore, Acacia Collagen produces a protective barrier on the skin's surface, defending against environmental aggressors and preventing moisture loss. This is very useful for preserving the skin's natural moisture balance and keeping it moisturised and supple.</span></p>
