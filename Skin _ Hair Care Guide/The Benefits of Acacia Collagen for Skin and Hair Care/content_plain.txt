Acacia collagen is a plant-based alternative to regular collagen, making it ideal for vegan or cruelty-free beauty products. In this blog, we discuss the benefits of Acacia Collagen for skin and hair care.
Understanding Acacia Collagen
It has been demonstrated to visually improve
fine wrinkles
and leave skin smoother and more supple. It accomplishes this by strengthening and enhancing the skin's own collagen and elastin fibres, as well as keeping water within the skin.
What is Acacia Collagen?
Acacia Collagen, or Acacia Seyal Gum Extract, is a plant-based substance obtained from the bark of the African Acacia tree. It was traditionally used in African culture for its therapeutic benefits and has now been repurposed for modern cosmetics due to its unique and beneficial attributes.
Acacia Collagen, unlike animal-derived
collagen
, is plant-based and vegan-friendly, making it a fantastic option for people seeking cruelty-free skincare. It is a powerful, moisturising substance that improves skin texture and appearance.
How Acacia Collagen is Derived
The science of Acacia Collagen resides in its distinct composition. It has a high concentration of polysaccharides, particularly galactose and rhamnose, which are known for their ability to bind water and soothe the skin. These components help to maintain moisture in the skin, resulting in a plumping effect that helps minimise the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Furthermore, Acacia Collagen produces a protective barrier on the skin's surface, defending against environmental aggressors and preventing moisture loss. This is very useful for preserving the skin's natural moisture balance and keeping it moisturised and supple.
