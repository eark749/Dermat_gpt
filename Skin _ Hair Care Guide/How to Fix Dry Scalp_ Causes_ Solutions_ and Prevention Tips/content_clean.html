<h3><b>Differentiating Between Dry Scalp and Dandruff</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Differentiating Between Dry Scalp and Dandruff" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Differentiating_Between_Dry_Scalp_and_Dandruff_480x480.jpg?v=1726037014"/></div>
<p><span>Dry scalp and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/dry-scalp">dandruff</a> can cause itching and flaking on the scalp. Sometimes it is difficult to differentiate between the two. However, too much oil creates dandruff, and a lack of moisture causes a dry scalp. When you use too much oil on your scalp, your skin cells can accumulate. Your scalp may appear red, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/oily-scalp">oily scalp</a>, or scaly. The scales quickly flake off, and dandruff emerges. Dandruff resembles bigger bits of dry skin flaking from your scalp. It is a highly common and recurring condition.</span></p>
<p><span>The main cause of dandruff is <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/seborrheic-dermatitis%20">seborrheic dermatitis</a>. Seborrheic dermatitis is a skin disorder that has multiple causes. Seborrheic dermatitis can be caused by yeast on your skin, stress, or a medical condition. Babies can have seborrheic dermatitis, too. A cradle cap occurs when your baby's scalp is scaly and dry. A dry scalp can cause itching and flaking, but it is not the same as dandruff. If you have a dry scalp, you may notice dryness throughout your body. In addition, the cause of the disease can vary. Lack of moisture can be caused by many reasons, including skin disorders.</span></p>
