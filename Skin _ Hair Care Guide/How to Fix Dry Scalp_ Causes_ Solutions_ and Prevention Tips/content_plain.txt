Dry scalps can be painful and cause flakiness, irritation, and hair dryness. This blog provides a thorough guide on how to treat dry scalp, including causes, remedies, and preventative suggestions.
Understanding Dry Scalp: An Overview
Dry scalp
occurs when the skin on your head loses an excessive amount of water or moisture. The illness can cause itching and flaking. The skin on your scalp becomes inflamed and flaky. There are several reasons why your scalp could be dry. Some hair care products can dry out and irritate. The scalp is affected by both climate and age.
The Science Behind Dry Scalp: Common Causes

clogging pores
, and causing itching and inflammation.
How to Identify Dry Scalp: Key Symptoms
Many different factors can contribute to dry skin and a dry scalp. Some instances include the following:
Insufficient water consumption.
Using chemical-based cleaning products.
Taking long, hot baths or showers
Living in a cold, dry environment.
Using artificial heat sources, such as central heating and wood-burning stoves, to dry out the air.
Differentiating Between Dry Scalp and Dandruff
Dry scalp and
dandruff
can cause itching and flaking on the scalp. Sometimes it is difficult to differentiate between the two. However, too much oil creates dandruff, and a lack of moisture causes a dry scalp. When you use too much oil on your scalp, your skin cells can accumulate. Your scalp may appear red,
oily scalp
, or scaly. The scales quickly flake off, and dandruff emerges. Dandruff resembles bigger bits of dry skin flaking from your scalp. It is a highly common and recurring condition.
The main cause of dandruff is
seborrheic dermatitis
. Seborrheic dermatitis is a skin disorder that has multiple causes. Seborrheic dermatitis can be caused by yeast on your skin, stress, or a medical condition. Babies can have seborrheic dermatitis, too. A cradle cap occurs when your baby's scalp is scaly and dry. A dry scalp can cause itching and flaking, but it is not the same as dandruff. If you have a dry scalp, you may notice dryness throughout your body. In addition, the cause of the disease can vary. Lack of moisture can be caused by many reasons, including skin disorders.
