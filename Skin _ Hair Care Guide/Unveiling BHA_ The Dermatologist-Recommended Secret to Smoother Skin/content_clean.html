<p><b></b><span>BHA (beta hydroxy acid) is a dermatologist-recommended substance that promotes smoother, cleaner skin. This blog takes a detailed look at BHA, its benefits, how to use it, and why dermatologists frequently recommend it.</span></p>
<p><b>What is BHA (Salicylic Acid)? </b><span>BHA is a form of chemical exfoliator from the beta hydroxy acid family.  The most prevalent type of BHA used in cosmetics is <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/salicylic-range">salicylic acid</a>, which is obtained from willow bark. BHA is oil-soluble, allowing it to enter pores and exfoliate both the skin's surface and within them. BHA benefits include unclogging pores, exfoliating surface skin, reducing inflammation, controlling oil production, improving skin tone, and preventing breakouts.</span></p>

<p><span>The science behind <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/aha-bha-range">BHA</a> (beta hydroxy acid), specifically salicylic acid, demonstrates its skincare efficacy and distinct benefits for a variety of skin issues. This blog is a detailed look at the science behind BHA and how it affects the skin.</span></p>
<p><b>Structure and Properties of Salicylic Acid (BHA)</b><span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Salicylic acid is a beta hydroxy acid (BHA) with a lipophilic (oil-attracting) and hydrophilic (water-attracting) structure.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Unlike alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), BHA is oil-soluble, allowing it to penetrate and dissolve sebum (oil) in pores.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The lipophilic nature of salicylic acid enables it to penetrate deeper into the pores, making it effective for exfoliating inside the follicles.</span></p>

<h3><b>Understanding BHA and Its Skin Benefits</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Understanding BHA and Its Skin Benefits" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Understanding_BHA_and_Its_Skin_Benefits_480x480.jpg?v=1718864170"/></div>
<p><span>BHA, or beta hydroxy acid, is a chemical exfoliant that is frequently utilized in skincare products due to its unique qualities and skin advantages. The most prevalent type of BHA used in skincare is salicylic acid. BHA (Beta Hydroxy Acid) is a type of <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/exfoliation%20">exfoliation</a> chemical that is oil-soluble and can penetrate the skin's pores. Salicylic acid is the most popular and extensively utilized BHA in skincare products. BHA (Salicylic Acid) benefits the skin by exfoliating, unclogging pores, reducing <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-the-ultimate-nia-10-niacinamide-serum">acne</a> and breakouts, improving skin texture, controlling oil production, and increasing product penetration.</span></p>
<h3><b>How BHA Differs from Other Exfoliants</b></h3>
<div><img alt="How BHA Differs from Other Exfoliants" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/How_BHA_Differs_from_Other_Exfoliants_480x480.jpg?v=1718864170"/></div>
<p><span>Beta hydroxy acid (BHA), specifically salicylic acid, is distinct from other forms of exfoliants, such as alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), in terms of chemical structure, characteristics, and skincare effects. Understanding these distinctions can help you select the best exfoliant for your skin type and issues. Here's a comparison between BHA and other exfoliants:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>BHA (Beta Hydroxy Acid, Salicylic Acid)</b><span>: BHA is oil-soluble, therefore it can penetrate deep into pores. Salicylic acid comes from willow bark and other plant sources. It penetrates pores and exfoliates within the follicles. Effective for treating acne, blackheads, and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/open-pores">clogged pores</a>. Its anti-inflammatory characteristics make it ideal for sensitive and acne-prone skin. It helps control sebum production.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>AHAs (Alpha Hydroxy Acids, e.g., Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid)</b><span>:</span> <span>AHAs are water soluble and act on the skin's surface. Fruits are common sources (for example, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/glycolic-acid">glycolic acid</a> from sugarcane and lactic acid from milk). Exfoliates the skin's outer layer (the epidermis). Enhances skin texture, brightness, and smoothness. It stimulates <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/collagen">collagen</a> production. Improves <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">hyperpigmentation</a> and aging spots. It may enhance solar sensitivity.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Best Practices for Using BHA</b></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Choose the Right BHA Product</b><span>: Look for skincare products with salicylic acid as an active ingredient. BHA is typically found in <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-foaming-face-wash">cleansers</a>, toners, serums, spot treatments, and exfoliant products. If you're new to utilizing BHA, start with a lesser concentration (around 0.5% to 2%) to reduce irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cleanse Your Skin</b><span>: Begin your skincare routine by cleaning your face with a gentle cleanser tailored to your skin type. Before applying BHA, make sure your skin is clean and clear of makeup and other pollutants.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Apply BHA Product</b><span>: Depending on the kind of product (e.g., toner, serum, exfoliant), apply a tiny amount of BHA to your fingertips or a cotton pad. Concentrate on areas where you have issues, such as acne, plugged pores, or excessive oil production. Avoid applying BHA to the delicate eye area.</span></p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use Sunscreen During the Day</b><span>: Because BHA can enhance UV sensitivity, it's critical to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or greater during the daytime. Reapply sunscreen every 2 hours, especially if you've been exposed to sunshine.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Adjust the frequency based on skin response</b><span>: Pay attention to how your skin reacts to BHA.
