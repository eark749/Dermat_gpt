<p><span>Remember that a multivitamin should supplement, not replace, a healthy and balanced diet. While multivitamins are useful, getting your nutrients from a range of whole meals is the best approach to meet your nutritional needs. Reevaluate your multivitamin selection on a regular basis based on changes in your health, lifestyle, or dietary habits.</span></p>
