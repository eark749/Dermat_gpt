Low estrogen levels can have a significant impact on hair health, especially in women, because it plays an important role in regulating hair growth. This blog discusses how low estrogen levels might influence your hair.
The Role of Estrogen in Hair Growth
Estrogen regulates
hair growth
and overall hair health. This is how it contributes:
Estrogen extends the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle, during which hair actively develops. This results in fuller, longer hair over time.
Estrogen improves blood circulation in the scalp, ensuring that hair follicles get enough nutrients and oxygen. This promotes the growth of strong and healthy hair.
Estrogen helps prevent
hair thinning
and loss by counteracting the effects of androgens (male hormones such as testosterone). Androgens can constrict hair follicles, resulting in shorter, finer hair, while estrogen can counteract this impact.
Higher estrogen levels are linked to softer, shinier, and more manageable hair. The hormone maintains the moisture and flexibility of the hair, keeping it from becoming dry and brittle.
After childbirth, estrogen levels decline, which can lead to increased hair shedding, sometimes known as postpartum
hair loss
. Similarly, in menopause, reduced estrogen levels can cause hair loss.
Estrogen increases the lifetime of hair follicles, allowing hair to stay rooted in the scalp for a longer time. This can result in reduced shedding and a healthier-looking mane.
How Estrogen Affects Hair Follicles
Estrogen has a strong influence on hair follicles, which are the structures in the skin that generate hair. Here's how estrogen impacts hair follicles: anagen phase extension, larger, healthier follicles, reduced follicle shrinkage, nutrition, and circulation, longer follicle lifespan, and post-menopausal changes. A decrease in estrogen levels, such as during menopause, can cause a variety of hair difficulties, mostly owing to changes in how hair follicles work.
Estrogen Levels Throughout a Woman's Life
Estrogen levels in a woman's body fluctuate throughout her life, affecting several aspects of her health, including reproductive function, mood, and hair quality. Estrogen levels fluctuate across numerous life phases, including childhood, puberty, reproductive stage, menopause, peri and post-menopause, and hormone replacement therapy.
Scientific Studies on Estrogen and Hair Health
Scientific research has focused on the relationship between estrogen and hair health, specifically how the hormone affects hair growth, follicle health, and hair loss. The study's primary findings include the presence of estrogen receptors in hair follicles, hair follicle size, postmenopausal hair loss,
androgenetic alopecia
, and the relationship between estrogen and hair density. They also emphasize the possible benefits of estrogen supplementation or therapy in preserving hair health, especially during hormonal transitions such as menopause.
Causes and Symptoms of Low Estrogen
Low estrogen levels can be caused by a variety of factors, resulting in a variety of symptoms that impair various aspects of health. Here's an overview of the causes and symptoms:
Low estrogen levels can be caused by menopause, ovarian insufficiency, hysterectomy, autoimmune illnesses, exercise, eating disorders, chronic stress, thyroid disorders, and chemotherapy.
Low estrogen symptoms include irregular periods, night sweats, vaginal dryness, mood swings and depression, sleep difficulties,
dry skin
, exhaustion, bone density loss, thinning hair, memory issues, and breast tenderness.
Common Causes of Estrogen Deficiency
Estrogen insufficiency, or the body's inability to make enough estrogen, can be caused by a variety of reasons. Listed below are some of the most common causes:
Menopause
: As women age and approach menopause (normally between the ages of 45 and 55), their ovaries gradually produce less estrogen. This natural decline is the leading cause of estrogen insufficiency.
Perimenopause
: During the transition to perimenopause, estrogen levels can fluctuate dramatically, resulting in times of estrogen shortage.
Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI)
: Premature ovarian failure occurs when the ovaries stop functioning normally before the age of 40, resulting in significantly lower estrogen output.
Hysterectomy
: The surgical removal of the ovaries or the uterus can result in a significant decline in estrogen levels, especially when both ovaries are removed.
Eating disorders
: Eating disorders can induce severe weight loss and starvation, resulting in lower estrogen production as the body conserves energy.
Intensive Physical Exercise
: Women who engage in high levels of physical activity, such as athletes, without adequate nutritional intake may experience estrogen deficiency due to the body’s response to physical stress.
Chronic Stress
: Prolonged or severe stress can disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, resulting in a drop in estrogen production.
Thyroid Disorders
: Thyroid can affect the body's hormonal balance, particularly estrogen, resulting in estrogen insufficiency.
Chemotherapy and Radiation
: Chemotherapy and radiation therapy, particularly when targeting the pelvic area, can damage the ovaries and result in diminished estrogen production.
Autoimmune Disorders
: Some autoimmune disorders can cause ovarian damage or dysfunction, which leads to reduced estrogen levels.
Pituitary Gland Disorders
: Pituitary gland regulates hormone production, including estrogen, can result in deficits.
Medications
: Some medications, such as those used to treat endometriosis, breast cancer (tamoxifen), and certain psychiatric disorders, can interfere with estrogen production.
Postpartum Period
: After giving birth, a woman's estrogen levels drop dramatically, which can result in a temporary state of estrogen deficiency.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
: It is commonly connected with excessive androgen levels, it can also induce inconsistent estrogen synthesis, which can lead to an estrogen shortage in some cases.
Obesity
: It can cause hormonal imbalances by interfering with the body's ability to produce estrogen.
Recognizing Symptoms of Low Estrogen
Recognizing the symptoms of low estrogen is crucial since it can affect many aspects of health and quality of life. Low estrogen levels can cause irregular menstrual cycles, night sweats, vaginal dryness, sleep problems, fatigue, thinning hair, bone density loss, dry skin, breast tenderness, repeated urinary tract infections, headaches, and weight gain. If you have any of these symptoms, especially if they occur simultaneously, you should see a physician. They can help diagnose low estrogen levels and provide appropriate treatment choices, for example, hormone replacement therapy (HRT).
Diagnosing Hormonal Imbalances
Hormonal imbalances are diagnosed using complex methods that include medical testing, symptoms, and taking into account underlying health issues. The procedure is as follows: medical history, physical examination, blood tests, saliva or urine tests, imaging tests, specialized tests, drugs and lifestyle, consultation with specialists or
dermatologists
, and follow-up. Combining a complete medical history with appropriate diagnostic testing allows healthcare practitioners to accurately diagnose hormonal imbalances and develop an effective treatment plan tailored to your unique needs.
Treatments for Hair Loss Due to Low Estrogen
Hair loss caused by low estrogen can be managed and treated using a mix of medicinal therapies, lifestyle changes, and hair care techniques. Here are some of the most effective therapies:
Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)
: HRT is commonly used to restore estrogen levels in women going through menopause or other conditions that cause low estrogen. By restoring estrogen, HRT can help minimize hair thinning and encourage regeneration. In some circumstances, estrogen is mixed with progesterone (for women who have not had a hysterectomy) to balance hormones and protect the uterine wall.
Estrogen Creams or Lotions
: When applied directly to the scalp, these treatments can stimulate hair follicles and encourage hair growth. However, these are less often used and should only be prescribed by a healthcare provider.
Minoxidil (Rogaine)
:
Minoxidil
is an over-the-counter medication for hair loss. It works by extending the anagen phase of the hair cycle and enlarging hair follicles. It is often used in women who have thinning hair due to low estrogen levels or other factors.
Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy
:
PRP therapy
involves injecting your platelet-rich plasma into the scalp to promote hair growth. It is thought to improve hair follicle function and increase hair density, making it a popular treatment for hormonally induced hair loss.
Nutritional Supplements
: Biotin is known to improve hair health; biotin supplements may help strengthen hair and increase growth. Low amounts of vitamin D are linked to hair loss. Supplementation can benefit hair health. Iron deficiency can worsen hair loss. If you have a low iron level, supplements may be prescribed. Fish oil contains omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory qualities and can enhance scalp health and hair development. Zinc promotes hair follicle health and may be advantageous if you are low.
Diet and Lifestyle Modifications
: Make sure your diet has lots of protein, iron, and other elements required for hair health. Consuming foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals can help promote hair development. Stress can cause hair loss; however, meditation, yoga, and enough sleep can help balance hormones and reduce hair thinning. Physical exercise regulates hormones and improves blood circulation, which promotes hair growth.
Hair Care Practices
: Use gentle
shampoos
and
conditioners
to avoid irritating your scalp. Avoid severe treatments such as excessive heat styling, chemical processing, and tight hairstyles, which can exacerbate thinning hair. Regular scalp massages can stimulate blood flow to hair follicles, which promotes hair growth. Overwashing can deplete the scalp's natural oils, which are necessary for healthy hair. Washing your hair 2-3 times a week is typically sufficient.
Medications for Underlying Conditions
: If low estrogen levels are caused by thyroid problems, hormone replacement therapy can help stabilize hair loss. Medication such as metformin may help women with PCOS balance their hormones and decrease hair loss.
Hair Restoration Procedures
: For severe hair loss, surgical procedures such as hair transplants may be explored. This entails transferring hair follicles from one section of the scalp to thinning or
balding
areas.
Consultation
: A specialist in hair and scalp diseases can offer personalized advice and treatment choices depending on your unique issue. If your hair loss is caused by a complex hormonal imbalance, an endocrinologist can help you manage and cure the underlying concerns.
Prescription Medications
: In rare circumstances, medication such as spironolactone is used to prevent androgens, which can lead to hair loss in women with low estrogen levels. Though finasteride is more often used in men, it can be recommended for postmenopausal women to decrease hair loss.
Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT)
: This non-invasive procedure employs laser light to stimulate hair follicles and promote growth. It's a popular choice for addressing hair loss caused by hormone imbalances.
Hormone Replacement Therapy Options
Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is used to treat symptoms caused by hormone shortages, such as low estrogen levels during menopause and other disorders. There are various forms of HRT, each with a unique administration route and formulation. Here's a summary of the main choices:
Estrogen therapy
: Women who have had a hysterectomy (uterine removal) but require estrogen to manage menopausal symptoms. Estrogens are taken orally. Adhesive patches are applied to the skin to gradually release estrogen. Topical gels or creams, are applied directly to the skin. These are inserted into the vagina and provide localized estrogen. These are used to treat vaginal symptoms locally.
Combination Therapy
: Women with an intact uterus to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer associated with estrogen-only therapy. Oral tablets containing estrogen and progesterone.
Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT)
: People who prefer hormones that are chemically identical to those produced by the body naturally. BHRT is often customized to individual needs. Oral tablets, creams, and gels are examples of custom-compounded formulations that are created especially for the patient. Various forms are customized to meet specific hormone requirements.
Local Estrogen Therapy
: Used to treat localized symptoms like vaginal dryness and atrophic vaginitis.
Implants
: Used to provide a consistent release of hormones over months. Small pellets, such as those for estrogen or combined hormones, are implanted beneath the skin as hormone implants.
Injections
: Used for regular, periodic hormone administration. Estrogen injections, such as estradiol cypionate or estradiol valerate, are administered every few weeks to months.
Transdermal Systems
: It is used for continuous hormone delivery through the skin. They deliver a consistent level of hormones and are changed weekly or biweekly.
Natural Remedies to Balance Hormones
Hormone balance is achieved naturally through lifestyle modifications, dietary alterations, and the use of specific herbs and supplements. Dietary changes, herbal remedies (such as Vitex, Ashwagandha, Rhodiola rosea, etc), lifestyle changes, supplements (such as Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Vitamin D and B, etc), and avoiding endocrine disruptors are all effective natural hormone balancers. However, it is important to consult with a physician before beginning any new
hair growth supplements
or making any changes to your health regimen, particularly if you have underlying health concerns.
Lifestyle Changes for Better Hormonal Health
Lifestyle modifications can help to promote hormonal health and balance. Some important areas to focus on are stress management, sleep, regular physical activity, nutrition, hydration, weight management, avoiding endocrine disruptors, emotional well-being, regular check-ups, and mindful eating. Integrating these lifestyle modifications into your daily routine will help you maintain good hormonal health and improve your overall well-being. Consistency is essential, and making small alterations can lead to long-term, beneficial results. If you have specific hormonal difficulties, you should visit a healthcare specialist for personalized advice and treatment choices.
