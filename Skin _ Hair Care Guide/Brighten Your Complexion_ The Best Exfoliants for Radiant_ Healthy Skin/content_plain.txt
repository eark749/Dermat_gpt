Are you tired of dealing with dull, lifeless skin? Using an exfoliant or exfoliator for face and skin can be a game-changer when it comes to achieving a radiant, healthy-looking complexion. But with so many exfoliants on the market, how do you choose the best exfoliator as per your skin type and concerns? We turned to the experts – dermatologists – for their advice on using natural or chemical exfoliators for dry skin, oily skin, and other skin types.
What are the benefits of using a face exfoliator?
Exfoliating is the process of removing dead skin cells from the surface of your skin. It can be done chemically or mechanically, using ingredients or tools like scrubs or brushes. Exfoliating is important because it helps to unclog pores, smooth and even out skin texture, and improve the overall appearance of your skin.
As we age, our skin's natural exfoliation process slows down, leading to a build-up of dead skin cells on the surface. This can cause the skin to look dull and can even lead to clogged pores and breakouts. Exfoliating helps to speed up the skin's natural exfoliation process and can reveal brighter, smoother skin underneath.
Key ingredients in exfoliators and their skin benefits
Exfoliators are skincare products that aid in the removal of dead skin cells from the skin's surface, resulting in a smoother and brighter complexion. Physical exfoliators, which utilise abrasive particles to manually scrub away dead skin, and chemical exfoliators, which employ acids or enzymes to dissolve or remove dead skin cells, are the two main types of exfoliators. The following are major elements present in exfoliators, as well as their skin benefits:
Physical Exfoliators
:
Jojoba Beads
: Gentle physical exfoliation without causing microtears in the skin. Suitable for sensitive skin.
Apricot Seeds or Walnut Shells
: They provide moderate exfoliation, but be cautious because the edges can be sharp and irritate the skin. If you have sensitive skin, avoid this product.
Sugar or Salt
: Natural exfoliants that dissolve easily in water and provide gentle physical exfoliation. Suitable for a variety of skin types.
Bamboo Extract
: Benefits include a mild exfoliation due to the fine particles. Packed with silica, which is well-known for brightening skin.
Chemical Exfoliators
:
Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs)
: Aldelic acid (derived from almonds), lactic acid (from milk), and glycolic acid (from sugar cane) are a few examples. Increase cell turnover by exfoliating the skin's surface. AHAs work well for sun damage, uneven skin tone, and fine lines.
BHA (beta hydroxide)
: salicylic acid is one example. It effectively treats oily or acne-prone skin by penetrating the pores. It aids in the unclogging of pores and the reduction of inflammation.
Enzyme
: Examples of enzymes include papain (from papaya) and bromelain (from pineapple). Benefits include the ability to gently digest and loosen dead skin cells. It is gentle on the skin and can provide a more even exfoliation.
Polyhydroxy Acids (PHAs)
: Gluconolactone and lactobionic acid are two examples. These have larger molecules than AHAs, which makes them gentler. Apply hydration and exfoliation that is safe for delicate skin.
Retinoids (Retinol, Retinoid Derivatives)
: Accelerate cell turnover, stimulate collagen production, and improve skin texture. Effective for addressing signs of aging.
Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)
:
Acts as both an antioxidant and exfoliant. It helps brighten the skin, even out skin tone, and stimulate collagen synthesis.
Hyaluronic Acid
:
While not a traditional exfoliator, it hydrates and plumps the skin. Often included in exfoliating products to counteract potential dryness.
Niacinamide (Vitamin B3)
:
Supports the skin barrier, helps reduce redness, and addresses hyperpigmentation. Often included in exfoliating formulations for added benefits.
Salicylates (Willow Bark Extract)
:
Natural source of salicylic acid, providing gentle exfoliation. Suitable for sensitive skin.
Exfoliators and their ingredients should be chosen with your skin type, problems, and sensitivity in mind. Exfoliation should be used gradually in your skincare routine to avoid irritation. Over-exfoliation can cause skin sensitivity, redness, and other problems, so following product directions and paying attention to your skin's reaction is critical. Consult a dermatologist for personalised guidance if you have specific skin issues or conditions.

hassle-free from the comfort of your home. Broadly speaking, there are 2 types of face exfoliants.
Gentle exfoliation techniques for sensitive skin
Exfoliating sensitive skin should be done carefully and gently to prevent irritation and inflammation. The following mild exfoliation methods are appropriate for sensitive skin:
Enzyme Exfoliation
: Look for products that have natural enzymes like bromelain (found in pineapple) or papain (found in papaya). Enzymes break down dead skin cells without producing sharp particles. They do not irritate people as easily, and are usually gentle.
Chemical Exfoliants
: Choose gentle chemical exfoliants, such as salicylic acid or beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs) like gluconolactone, which are polyhydroxy acids (PHAs). By dissolving dead skin cells and unclogging pores without the need for harsh scrubbing, these acids offer chemical exfoliation.
Jojoba Beads
: Goods that contain jojoba beads as an ingredient. The round, smooth beads of jojoba offer a mild physical exfoliation that does not cause microscopic tears in the skin.
Oatmeal Scrubs
: Goods that have oatmeal that has been finely ground. Muesli offers mild physical exfoliation and calming qualities. As dead skin cells are removed, it can help soothe sensitive skin.
Konjac Sponges
: After wetting the sponge, move it in circular motions while using a mild cleanser. The soft nature of konjac sponges makes them ideal for mild physical exfoliation. They are safe for delicate skin and all-natural.
Micellar Water
: Dampen a cotton pad with micellar water and dab the skin with it. You can remove dead skin cells without having to rinse with micellar water because it contains mild surfactants.
Honey and Brown Suga
r: Scrub Make a paste by combining honey and brown sugar in a homemade recipe.  Apply the paste to wet skin and massage it in gently. Brown sugar gently exfoliates the skin, and honey has calming effects
Rosewater and Glycerin Spray
: In a spray bottle, combine glycerin and rosewater. Apply a mist of the mixture to your face and massage it in. Benefits include glycerin's ability to hydrate and the somewhat astringent effect of rosewater. This may be a mild method for revitalising and exfoliating delicate skin.
Green Tea Scrub
: Combine some honey and finely ground green tea leaves. Apply a light massage to wet skin. Honey adds moisture and has a light exfoliating effect, while green tea has anti-inflammatory qualities.
Tips for Gentle Exfoliation on Sensitive Skin:
To prevent over-exfoliation, limit your weekly exfoliation to one or two times.
Before using a new product, always conduct a patch test to make sure it will not irritate your skin.
To prevent UV damage to sensitive skin, apply sunscreen every day, especially after exfoliation.
Steer is clear of products that contain sizable, abrasive particles as they may lead to tiny tears in the skin.
To receive individualised advice and recommendations regarding skin conditions or sensitive skin, it is recommended that you speak with a dermatologist.
Frequency and timing of exfoliation
Your skin type, the kind of exfoliant you are using, and your level of skin sensitivity are all factors that affect how often and when you should exfoliate. Here are a few broad recommendations:
Physical Exfoliation
: 1-2 times a week is the frequency. To get rid of dead skin cells accumulated throughout the day, use physical exfoliants in the evening. After using the scrub, do not use too much pressure, and then apply a light moisturiser.
Chemical Exfoliation (AHAs and BHAs)
: 1-3 times a week, depending on how well your skin tolerates it. The best time to use chemical exfoliation is usually in the evening because certain ingredients, such as alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), can increase your skin's sensitivity to sunlight. Use ahead of your nocturnal moisturiser.
Enzyme Exfoliation:
1-3 times a week is the frequency. Enzyme exfoliants are frequently applied in the evening before your moisturiser, just like chemical exfoliants.
Retinoids
: Follow your dermatologist's or product's instructions regarding frequency. It could begin with a few times per week and gradually increase. They are typically used at night because they can increase sensitivity to sunlight. Apply before your nightly moisturiser.
Konjac Sponges or Gentle Scrubs
: 1-2 times per week is the recommended frequency. Depending on your preferences, it can be used in the morning or evening. After that, apply a light moisturiser.
Daily Exfoliation (Mild Formulations)
: Some people may be able to tolerate daily exfoliation with very mild formulations. This could include gentle cleansers with low concentrations of AHAs or BHAs. vDepending on the product and your routine, either morning or evening.
Tips for Safe Exfoliation
:
Start Slowly
: If you are new to exfoliation or experimenting with a new product, begin with a lower frequency and gradually increase as your skin develops tolerance.
Listen to Your Skin
: Reduce the frequency of exfoliation or switch to a milder product if you notice redness, irritation, or excessive dryness.
Sun protection
: Always wear sunscreen during the day, especially if you are using exfoliating products. Exfoliants can make you more sensitive to the sun.
It is critical to adjust your exfoliating practice to the needs of your skin and to be aware of any signs of discomfort. If you have specific skin issues or conditions, you should speak with a dermatologist for personalised advice. Individual reactions to exfoliants vary, so it may take some trial and error to determine the best frequency and timing for your skin.
How to choose a chemical exfoliant for face
The best exfoliant is the one that is suited for your skin type. So, you can consult dermatologists online to discover the best chemical exfoliants for your face and other parts of the skin.
Using chemical exfoliants for face
Chemical exfoliants, also known as alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), use ingredients like glycolic acid, lactic acid, and salicylic acid to dissolve the bonds between dead skin cells and reveal the healthy, glowing skin beneath. Chemical exfoliants can be found in toners, serums, and peels and are suitable for all skin types.
They can be gentler on the skin than physical exfoliants, which use ingredients like beads or grains to scrub the skin. These products can be effective at penetrating the pores and reaching deeper layers of the skin, making them a good choice for people with oily or acne-prone skin. They can also be suitable for people with sensitive skin, since they don't involve the physical friction that can sometimes be irritating. Just be sure to use
sunscreen
when using chemical exfoliants, as they can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.
Understanding AHA, BHA, and PHA in chemical exfoliants
Chemical exfoliants that are often utilised in skincare products include alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), and polyhydroxy acids (PHAs). Each type of acid has distinct characteristics and skin advantages. Here's a rundown of AHA, BHA, and PHA:
Choosing the Right Acid for Your Skin
:
Combination Use
: Some products may combine multiple acids to provide a broader range of benefits. For example, a product may contain glycolic acid (AHA) as well as salicylic acid (BHA).
Individual Tolerance
:
Individuals may react differently to different acids. Begin with lower concentrations and gradually increase based on the response of your skin.
Sun Protection
:
The use of chemical exfoliants regularly increases sun sensitivity. Use sunscreen every day, especially when using these products.
Consideration for Sensitivity
:
PHAs are frequently recommended for those with sensitive skin due to their larger molecular size and gentler exfoliation.
Professional Guidance
:
If you are unsure which acid is best for your skin or have specific skin concerns, see a dermatologist for personalised advice.
Including chemical exfoliants in your skincare routine can help improve the texture, tone, and overall appearance of your skin. However, they must be used with caution, following your skin's reaction.
How to exfoliate skin: Step-by-step guide
It's important to not overdo it when it comes to exfoliating. How often you exfoliate will depend on your skin type and the exfoliant you're using. Generally, it's safe to exfoliate one to three times per week. If you have sensitive skin or are using a strong exfoliant, you may want to start with once a week and gradually increase the frequency as your skin adjusts.
It's also important to remember to follow up with a moisturizer after exfoliating to help nourish and protect the skin. Always be sure to use sunscreen during the day, as exfoliating can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. If you're not sure how often you should exfoliate, it's always best to consult with a dermatologist or skincare professional. They can assess your skin type and recommend the right exfoliating frequency and products for your specific needs.
Overall, the key is to find a balance that works for your skin. Exfoliating can help remove dead skin cells and improve the texture and appearance of your skin, but over-exfoliating can strip your skin of its natural oils and cause irritation and other skin issues. So be sure to pay attention to how your skin feels and looks, and adjust your exfoliating routine accordingly.
Pre-exfoliation skin preparation
Preparing your skin for exfoliation is essential for increasing the effectiveness of the exfoliation process and reducing the risk of irritation. Here are some pre-exfoliation skin preparation steps:
Cleanse Your Skin
: Begin by removing makeup, oil, and impurities from the skin with a gentle cleanser. To prepare your skin for exfoliation, use a cleanser appropriate for your skin type.
Patch Test New Products
: Perform a patch test before introducing a new exfoliating product into your routine. Apply a small amount of the product to a discreet area, such as behind the ear, and wait 24 hours to see if there is any irritation or allergic reaction.
Assess Your Skin's Condition
: Consider your skin's current state. If your skin is irritated, sunburned, or has open wounds, you should avoid exfoliation until your skin has healed.
Choose the Right Exfoliant
: Choose an exfoliant that is appropriate for your skin type and concerns. If you have sensitive skin, use a gentle exfoliant like polyhydroxy acid (PHA) to reduce the risk of irritation.
Gradual Introduction
: Start with a lower concentration if you're new to exfoliation or using a more potent product, and gradually increase frequency or strength depending on your skin's response.
Avoid Other Harsh Ingredients
: Before exfoliating, avoid using products containing potentially irritating chemicals such as retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, or vitamin C. This reduces the possibility of oversaturating the skin with active ingredients.
Hydrate Your Skin
: Use a lightweight moisturiser to keep your skin hydrated. Hydrated skin is less prone to irritation and responds better to exfoliation.
Sun Protection
: Always apply sunscreen first thing in the morning, especially if you are exfoliating. Exfoliated skin is more sensitive to the sun, so protecting it from UV rays is important.
Consider Professional Treatments
: Consult a skincare professional before undergoing professional exfoliation treatments such as chemical peels. They can assess your skin and recommend an appropriate treatment plan.
Follow Product Instructions
: Read and adhere to the exfoliating product's instructions. Some products may suggest specific application methods or frequencies of use.
Consult with a Dermatologist
: Before introducing exfoliation into your routine, contact a dermatologist if you have specific skin issues or conditions. They can make personalised recommendations based on the needs of your skin.
Remember that exfoliation is meant to enhance your skin's health and appearance, so it's important to approach it with care. If you experience persistent redness, irritation, or discomfort, discontinue use and seek advice from a skincare professional.
Post-exfoliation skin care tips
It is critical to follow a proper post-exfoliation skincare routine after exfoliating your skin to maximise the benefits and reduce the risk of irritation. Here are some post-exfoliation skin care recommendations:
Apply a Soothing Toner
: Use a gentle, alcohol-free toner containing calming ingredients such as chamomile or aloe vera. This can help to balance the pH of the skin and provide a refreshing sensation.
Use a moisturiser to hydrate your skin
: After cleansing, apply a hydrating moisturiser to replenish the skin's moisture barrier. To lock in hydration, look for a product that contains ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, or ceramides.
Avoid Harsh Products
:
Avoid using products with strong active ingredients, such as retinoids or additional exfoliants, after exfoliation. Allow your skin to recover without overburdening it with active ingredients.
Sunscreen is Non-Negotiable
:
Even if you exfoliate in the evening, use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30. Exfoliation can make your skin more vulnerable to sun damage, while sunscreen protects against harmful UV rays.
Limit Sun Exposure
:
If at all possible, avoid direct sunlight on the day you exfoliate. If you must go outside, wear a hat with a wide brim and seek shade.
Stay Hydrated
:
Keep your skin hydrated from the inside out by drinking plenty of water. Skin recovery and overall skin health require adequate hydration.
Use a Calming Face Mask (Optional)
: After exfoliating, apply a calming and hydrating face mask. To soothe the skin, look for masks that contain aloe vera, chamomile, or calendula.
Be Gentle
:
Avoid aggressive scrubbing or using abrasive brushes on exfoliated skin. To avoid irritation, gently massage your skin.
Observe Your Skin
:
Take note of how your skin reacts after exfoliation. Adjust your routine and consider spacing out your exfoliation sessions if you notice any redness, irritation, or unusual sensitivity.
Moisturise Body Skin
: After exfoliating your skin, apply a moisturiser to keep it hydrated and smooth.
Skip Strong Actives for a While
: Give your skin a break from strong active ingredients for a day or two after exfoliation. This includes retinoids, vitamin C, and potent serums.
Consult a Dermatologist for Concerns
: If you experience persistent redness, irritation, or any adverse reactions post-exfoliation, consult with a dermatologist for guidance.
To achieve effective exfoliation, keep in mind that moderation is the key to consistency. Over-exfoliation can weaken your skin's protective layer and cause sensitivity and irritation. Consult a skincare expert for guidance on a customised and secure exfoliation regimen if you have any particular concerns or conditions.
Exfoliate for a fresh, radiant glow!
You can easily get brighter and more radiant skin by using a natural or chemical exfoliant for your face. You can find suitable skincare products online, or even better- get an online dermatologist consultation to find out how to exfoliate your skin for a fresh, youthful look.
Using mechanical exfoliants for face
Mechanical exfoliants use physical tools or ingredients, like grains or beads, to scrub away dead skin cells. Popular mechanical exfoliants include scrubs, brushes, and sponges. These types of exfoliants are best for those with oily or combination skin, as they can be too harsh for those with dry or sensitive skin.
Mechanical exfoliants can be a good choice for people with tougher, thicker skin or for those who prefer a more physical method of exfoliation. It's important to use these products gently, as over-exfoliating can irritate or damage the skin. It's also important to choose a product with appropriate-sized beads or grains for your skin type and to avoid using them on broken or irritated skin. Some people may find that mechanical exfoliants can be more drying to the skin, so it's important to follow up with a moisturizer after use.
Homemade scrub for glowing skin
Many people try to use a homemade scrub for glowing skin. However, this will not work if you use ingredients that are unsuitable for your skin type. Therefore, dermatologists often recommend skincare products that help exfoliate your face and other parts of the skin safely and effectively. Here's a basic recipe that uses natural ingredients you probably already have in your kitchen:
Ingredients
: 2 tablespoons finely ground oats, 1 tablespoon honey (raw, organic honey), 1 tablespoon almond or olive oil (for extra moisture), 1 tablespoon yoghurt or milk (optional) (for a soothing effect) Optional: 1 teaspoon lemon juice (for brightening, but avoid if you have sensitive skin). Essential oils (such as lavender or tea tree) and a few drops of fragrance (make sure it is skin-safe)
Instructions
:
Grind the oats into a fine powder in a blender or food processor. Oats are great for gentle exfoliation and skin soothing.
Mix In a mixing bowl, combine the finely ground oats and honey. Mix in the almond (or olive) oil thoroughly. Add any additional ingredients, such as yoghurt, lemon juice, or essential oils, now.
Check the consistency and add more honey or oil as needed to achieve the desired consistency. The mixture should be thick enough to stay on your skin while not being too dry.
Before using the scrub, cleanse your face with a gentle cleanser. Apply the scrub to your face in gentle circular motions. Take care around the eyes.
Allow the scrub to sit on your face for a few minutes to allow the ingredients to work their magic.
Rinse with warm water and pat your face dry with a clean towel.
Use your favorite moisturizer to seal the hydration.
Note
:
Patch Test
: Always perform a patch test before using any new ingredients on your face to ensure you do not have an allergic reaction.
Frequency
: Use a scrub to exfoliate your skin 1-2 times per week. Excessive exfoliation can cause skin irritation.
Storage
: Keep any leftovers in the fridge for a few days by placing them in an airtight container.
Keep in mind that every person has a different type of skin, so pay attention to how your skin responds and modify the ingredients as necessary. Before attempting new skincare regimens, it is best to speak with a dermatologist if you have any specific skin conditions or concerns.
Best exfoliator for oily or acne-prone skin
If you have acne-prone skin, exfoliating can be a helpful way to remove excess oil and dead skin cells that can contribute to breakouts. However, it's important to choose an exfoliant that is gentle and non-irritating, as harsh or abrasive exfoliants can make acne worse. Chemical exfoliants, such as alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), can be effective at penetrating the pores and removing excess oil without being too harsh on the skin. Physical exfoliants, such as scrubs or brushes, may be too abrasive and should be used sparingly or avoided altogether. It's also important to follow a regular skincare routine and use non-comedogenic products to help prevent new breakouts from forming.
Best exfoliator for dry/sensitive skin
Exfoliating can be a great way to remove dead skin cells and improve the overall appearance of dry or sensitive skin. However, it's important to choose an exfoliant that is gentle and non-irritating to avoid further drying or irritation. Chemical exfoliants, such as alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or enzymes, can be a good choice for people with dry or sensitive skin as they are typically more gentle and less abrasive than physical exfoliants. It's important to start with a low concentration and frequency of use, gradually increasing as your skin becomes accustomed to the product. Avoid using physical exfoliants, such as scrubs or brushes, on dry or sensitive skin, as they can be too harsh and irritate the skin. It's also important to follow up with a moisturizer after exfoliating to help hydrate and nourish the skin
Best exfoliator for ageing skin
As we age, our skin's natural exfoliation process slows down, leading to the buildup of dead skin cells on the surface. Exfoliating can help to remove these dead skin cells and improve the overall appearance of aging skin. Chemical exfoliants, such as alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), can be effective at improving the texture and tone of aging skin. Physical exfoliants, such as scrubs or brushes, may be too harsh and abrasive for aging skin and should be used sparingly or avoided altogether. It's important to choose an exfoliant that is suitable for your skin type and to follow a regular skincare routine to help maintain healthy, youthful-looking skin. It's also important to use a moisturizer and sunscreen to help protect and nourish the skin.
Environmental considerations in choosing exfoliants
Choosing exfoliants with environmental factors in mind is critical for minimising environmental effects. Here are some things to think about while choosing environmentally friendly exfoliants:
Biodegradability
: Choose biodegradable exfoliants. This means that the exfoliating particles degrade naturally over time, lowering the danger of contamination to the environment. Jojoba beads, sugar, and salt are examples of biodegradable exfoliants.
Avoid Microbeads
: Microbeads are little plastic particles that are found in several exfoliating products. Because of their size, they frequently end up in water systems and can harm aquatic life. Choose items that do not include microbeads and are made with eco-friendly ingredients.
Natural and Renewable Ingredients
: Look for exfoliants made from natural or renewable chemicals. Plant-based products, such as pulverised seeds, nuts, or fruit pits, are not only effective but have a lower environmental impact.
Sustainable Sourcing
: Choose items from companies that prioritise sustainable ingredient sourcing. Brands that are devoted to ethical and sustainable practices frequently guarantee that the raw materials used in their goods are sourced in an environmentally responsible manner.
Minimal Packaging
: Consider the exfoliant's package. Choose products that come in minimal, recyclable, or biodegradable packaging. Brands that prioritise environmentally friendly packaging help reduce waste and environmental effects.
Cruelty-Free and Vegan Formulations
: Choose exfoliants from cruelty-free manufacturers that provide vegan formulas. This ensures that the products have not been tested on animals and do not include animal-derived substances, which contributes to ethical and environmentally responsible decisions.
Water Conservation
: Some exfoliants, particularly those containing microbeads or synthetic particles, may pollute water. Choose products that encourage water saving and environmental stewardship during the manufacturing process.
Check for Certifications
: Look for environmental certifications, such as the USDA Organic label, as well as certifications from cruelty-free and sustainable organisations. These certifications can demonstrate a company's dedication to environmentally friendly operations.
DIY Options
: Consider making your exfoliant with natural ingredients from your kitchen, such as sugar, coffee grounds, or oats. This gives you control over the ingredients while also lowering the environmental impact of commercial items.
Support Ethical Brands
: Select brands that prioritise ethical and sustainable practices. Brands that are open about their environmental commitments and initiatives are more likely to make environmentally conscious decisions throughout the product development process.
By taking these environmental considerations into account when selecting exfoliants, you may help promote sustainable and eco-friendly skincare practices. Furthermore, remaining knowledgeable about the environmental policies and practices of the businesses you support helps equip you to make ecologically conscientious skincare decisions.
