Rough bumpy skin has an uneven texture and a coarse feel to it. Rough skin, which is common on the face and body, can be caused by dryness or a build-up of dead skin cells. Exfoliation and hydration can both help to improve rough, bumpy skin. If you have rough and bumpy skin, it's important to use skincare products that exfoliate and smooth the skin. Here's a skincare routine that may help:
Cleanse
: Start by cleansing your skin with a
gentle
cleanser
that's suitable for your skin type. Avoid harsh scrubs or cleansers that contain sulphates or alcohol, as these can further dry out your skin.
Exfoliate
: Use a gentle exfoliating product that contains
alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs)
to help smooth and soften your skin. AHAs, such as
glycolic acid
and lactic acid, work by dissolving the bonds between dead skin cells, while BHAs, such as
salicylic acid
, penetrate the pores to help unclog them.
Moisturize
: Apply a hydrating
moisturizer
to help soothe and soften your skin. Look for products that contain ceramides, which help strengthen the skin's barrier, and
hyaluronic acid
, which helps hydrate the skin.
Protect
: Use a broad-spectrum
sunscreen
with an SPF of at least 30 to help protect your skin from further damage. UV rays can cause further dryness and irritation, so it's important to use sunscreen every day.
Treat
: Consider using a targeted treatment product, such as a retinoid or
vitamin C serum
, to help improve the texture and appearance of your skin. These ingredients can help stimulate collagen production and improve the skin's elasticity.
Remember, it's important to be consistent with your skincare routine to see results. Give your skin time to adjust to new products, and be patient as you work to improve its texture and appearance.
What are Skin Bumps
Skin bumps are raised areas on the skin that can vary in size, shape, and color. They can be caused by a wide range of factors, including infections, allergies, injuries, or other underlying medical conditions. Some common types of skin bumps include:
Acne
: Small, red, and often painful bumps caused by the clogging of hair follicles with oil and dead skin cells.
Warts
: Small, rough growths caused by a virus that can appear anywhere on the body.
Moles
: Raised or flat spots on the skin that can be brown, black, or flesh-coloured.
Skin tags
: Small, soft, flesh-coloured growths that hang off the skin.
Hives
: Raised, red or pale bumps that can appear suddenly due to an allergic reaction.
Eczema
: Scaly, itchy, and red patches of skin that can sometimes develop into bumps.
It is important to get any unusual or persistent skin bumps checked by a doctor, as they may indicate a more serious underlying condition.
What Causes Bumpy Skin

Bumpy Skin on Arms
Bumpy skin on the arms may be a sign of a common condition called
keratosis pilaris
, also known as "chicken skin." This condition is characterized by small, rough bumps that may be red or flesh-coloured and can appear on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks, or buttocks.
Keratosis pilaris is caused by the build-up of keratin, a protein that forms a protective layer on the skin. When too much keratin accumulates, it can block hair follicles, causing bumps to form.
While keratosis pilaris is generally harmless, it can be frustrating and may cause some itching or irritation. There is no cure for this condition, but there are several treatments that can help to reduce the appearance of the bumps and smooth the skin, such as:
Gentle exfoliation
: Use a gentle exfoliating scrub or a loofah to remove dead skin cells and help unclog pores.
Moisturize
: Keeping the skin hydrated can help to reduce the appearance of bumps. Use a moisturizer with urea, salicylic acid, or lactic acid to help soften the skin.
Prescription creams
: Topical creams containing retinoids or corticosteroids may be prescribed by a dermatologist to help reduce inflammation and improve the appearance of the skin.
Laser therapy
: In more severe cases, laser therapy may be used to reduce redness and smooth the skin.
If you are concerned about bumpy skin on your arms, it is always best to consult a dermatologist who can provide a proper diagnosis and recommend the most effective treatment for your specific case.
Advanced Care for Bumpy Skin
If you have bumpy skin, especially on your arms or thighs, it could be due to a condition known as keratosis pilaris. Here are some advanced treatment options:
Chemical peels containing alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) can help exfoliate the skin, unclog pores, and smooth rough, bumpy patches. Peels containing glycolic and salicylic acids are commonly used for this purpose. However, to avoid irritation, start with a lower concentration and gradually increase as tolerated.
Prescription-strength retinoids like tretinoin (Retin-A), adapalene (Differin), and tazarotene (Tazorac) can help improve the texture of bumpy skin by increasing cell turnover and decreasing keratin buildup. These medications can be applied directly to the affected areas, but they may cause dryness and irritation, so use them exactly as prescribed by a dermatologist.
Urea, a humectant, hydrates the skin and exfoliates dead skin cells. Prescription-strength urea creams, such as those with 20% urea, can help soften rough, bumpy skin and improve its texture. These creams are usually applied once or twice a day to the affected areas.
Laser treatments, such as intense pulsed light (IPL) or fractional laser resurfacing, can help improve the appearance of bumpy skin by reducing excess keratin and stimulating collagen production. Laser therapy can help to reduce redness, smooth out texture, and improve overall skin tone and texture.
Microneedling, also known as collagen induction therapy, is a technique in which a device with fine needles creates tiny punctures in the skin's surface. This process stimulates collagen production and enhances the penetration of topical medications, resulting in smoother, more even-toned skin. Microneedling can be performed by a dermatologist or skincare professional.
In-office chemical peels performed by a dermatologist or skincare professional can provide more thorough exfoliation and skin renewal than at-home peels. These peels typically contain higher concentrations of active ingredients and may involve a series of treatments to achieve optimal results.
Managing bumpy skin requires keeping the skin hydrated. Choose a moisturiser with ceramides, hyaluronic acid, or glycerin to help lock in moisture and prevent dryness. To keep your skin smooth and hydrated, apply moisturiser on a daily basis, particularly after bathing.
Before attempting any advanced treatments for bumpy skin, you should consult with a dermatologist or skincare professional to determine the root cause of your problem and create a personalised treatment plan. They can recommend the best options for your skin type, concerns, and medical history.
Topical Creams for Rough and Bumpy Skin
Several topical creams and treatments can help smooth out rough and bumpy skin. There are several topical creams that may help improve the appearance of rough and bumpy skin:
Salicylic acid cream
: Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid that exfoliates dead skin cells,
unclogs pores
, and reduces inflammation. It can be found in over-the-counter creams and lotions specifically formulated for rough and bumpy skin.
Urea cream
: Urea is a natural component of the skin's moisture barrier, and it helps to hydrate and soften rough, dry skin.
Urea creams
are available over-the-counter and can be particularly helpful for those with keratosis pilaris.
Retinoid cream
: Retinoids are derivatives of vitamin A that work by increasing cell turnover and improving skin texture. Prescription-strength retinoids can be effective for treating rough and bumpy skin, but they may cause irritation, dryness, and sensitivity.
Alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) cream
:
AHAs
, such as glycolic acid and lactic acid, exfoliate the surface of the skin, unclog pores, and stimulate collagen production. Over-the-counter AHA creams are available, but they may cause irritation and sensitivity.
Ceramide cream
: Ceramides are lipids that help to maintain the skin's moisture barrier and protect it from external irritants.
Ceramide creams
are available over-the-counter and can be particularly helpful for those with dry, rough skin.
It's important to choose a topical cream that is appropriate for your skin type and to follow the manufacturer's instructions for use. If you have any concerns or questions about using topical creams, it's best to consult with a dermatologist.
Exfoliating Treatments for Smoother Skin
Exfoliating treatments can help you get smoother skin by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, and increasing cell turnover. Here are some effective exfoliating treatments you should consider:
Physical Exfoliation
: Use a gentle facial scrub with fine particles like sugar, salt, or jojoba beads to manually exfoliate your skin. Massage the scrub into damp skin in circular motions, then rinse with warm water. Use a soft-bristled facial brush or an exfoliating tool to gently remove dead skin cells and impurities. Be gentle and avoid exfoliating too much, as this can irritate and inflame the skin.
Chemical Exfoliation
: Water-soluble acids such as glycolic acid, lactic acid, and mandelic acid help exfoliate the skin's surface, improve texture, and minimise the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Use AHAs as toners, serums, or creams. Salicylic acid is a BHA that is oil-soluble and penetrates deep into the pores to unclog them and remove excess oil and debris. It's particularly effective for acne-prone or oily skin types. Enzymes such as papain (from papaya) and bromelain (from pineapple) help dissolve dead skin cells without scrubbing. Enzyme exfoliants are gentle and suitable for sensitive skin types.
Chemical Peels
: Over-the-counter chemical peels containing AHAs or BHAs are available for at-home use. Follow the instructions carefully and start with a lower concentration to avoid irritation. Dermatologists or skincare professionals offer in-office chemical peels with higher concentrations of exfoliating acids for deeper exfoliation and skin renewal. These peels can help improve skin texture, tone, and clarity.
Microdermabrasion
: Microdermabrasion is a mechanical exfoliation treatment that uses a handheld device to gently sand away the outer layer of the skin. It helps improve skin texture, reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and promotes collagen production.
Exfoliating Masks
: Use exfoliating masks containing ingredients like clay, fruit enzymes, or AHAs/BHAs to unclog pores and remove dead skin cells. Apply the mask to clean, dry skin, leave it on for the recommended time, then rinse off with warm water.
Consistency and Sun Protection
: Consistency is key when it comes to exfoliating treatments. Incorporate exfoliation into your skincare routine 1-3 times per week, depending on your skin type and tolerance. Always follow up with a moisturizer and sunscreen after exfoliating to hydrate the skin and protect it from sun damage.
Before beginning any exfoliating treatment, patch test the product on a small area of your skin to ensure that there are no adverse reactions or sensitivities. If you have sensitive or acne-prone skin, consult a dermatologist to determine the best exfoliation method for your needs.
Moisturizing Strategies for Hydrated Skin
Maintaining hydrated skin is critical for its overall health and appearance. Here are some effective moisturising strategies to help your skin stay hydrated:
Choose the Right Moisturizer
: Choose a moisturiser appropriate for your skin type. If you have dry skin, choose a rich, emollient moisturiser containing shea butter, ceramides, or hyaluronic acid. For oily or acne-prone skin, use a lightweight, non-comedogenic moisturiser that does not clog pores. Consider using a moisturizer with added ingredients that address specific skin concerns, such as antioxidants for anti-aging or niacinamide to brighten and even out skin tone.
Apply Moisturizer to Damp Skin
: After cleansing or showering, gently pat your skin dry with a towel while keeping it slightly damp. Applying moisturiser to damp skin helps to lock in moisture and increase absorption, leaving your skin feeling softer and more hydrated.
Use Humidifiers
: Humidifiers add moisture to the air, which can help prevent dryness and keep skin hydrated, particularly during the winter when indoor heating can cause dry air. Use a humidifier in your bedroom or other frequently used areas to keep the air moist.
Stay Hydrated from Within
: Drink plenty of water all day to keep your body hydrated from the inside out. Aim for at least eight glasses of water per day, and adjust your intake depending on your activity level, climate, and overall health.
Limit Hot Showers and Baths
: Hot water can strip the skin's natural oils, causing dryness and irritation. Instead, use lukewarm water when showering or bathing, and keep your showers to 10-15 minutes to protect your skin's natural moisture barrier.
Protect Your Skin from the Sun
: Sun exposure can cause dehydration and premature ageing of the skin. Apply broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher every day, even on cloudy days, and reapply every two hours when spending time outside.
Use Overnight Moisturizing Treatments
: Apply a thicker, more occlusive moisturizer or a hydrating overnight mask before bedtime to provide intense hydration while you sleep. These products help replenish moisture levels and repair the skin's barrier function overnight, leaving you with smoother, more supple skin in the morning.
Consider Using Hyaluronic Acid
: Hyaluronic acid is a hydrating ingredient that attracts and holds moisture in the skin. Look for serums or moisturisers that contain hyaluronic acid to help your skin stay hydrated and plump.
Moisturize Regularly
: Make moisturising a part of your daily skincare routine, both in the morning and evening. Apply moisturiser to your face, neck, and body as needed to keep your skin hydrated all day.
By incorporating these moisturising strategies into your daily routine, you can help keep your skin hydrated and healthy-looking all year. If you have specific skin concerns or conditions, speak with a dermatologist about personalised recommendations and treatment options.
Takeaway: Get Rid of Rough and Bumpy Skin
If you're looking to get rid of rough and bumpy skin, there are a few things you can try:
Exfoliate regularly
: Use a gentle exfoliating scrub or body brush to slough off dead skin cells and smooth out rough patches. However, be careful not to over-exfoliate as this can cause irritation.
Moisturize
: Keep your skin well-hydrated by using a good-quality moisturizer. Look for products that contain ingredients like urea, lactic acid, or alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) that can help smooth out rough skin.
Use a retinoid
: Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that can help improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of bumps. They work by speeding up cell turnover and boosting collagen production.
Try a chemical peel
: If your skin is particularly rough or bumpy, a chemical peel can help remove dead skin cells and stimulate collagen production for smoother, softer skin. However, be sure to consult a dermatologist or aesthetician before trying this treatment.
Stay hydrated
: Drinking plenty of water can help keep your skin healthy and hydrated, which can improve its texture over time.
Be patient
: It can take time to see results, so be patient and consistent with your skincare routine. Remember to protect your skin from the sun's harmful UV rays by wearing sunscreen daily.
By incorporating these strategies into your skincare routine, you can significantly improve the texture of your skin and achieve a smoother, more radiant complexion.
