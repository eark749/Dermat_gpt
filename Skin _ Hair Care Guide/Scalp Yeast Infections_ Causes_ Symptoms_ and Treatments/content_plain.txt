Dietary Considerations for Preventing Yeast Overgrowth
The candida diet limits sweets, wheat, alcohol, and dairy products. Avoid high-sugar fruits, processed or refined fats and oils, and a variety of condiments. The diet seeks to reestablish a healthy balance of yeast and bacteria within your body. Long-term adherence to this restrictive diet can result in dietary shortages. As a result, the candida diet is typically recommended as a short-term therapy, until reintroducing the restricted foods causes symptoms to flare up again.
The candida diet focuses on limiting your carbohydrate intake, including sugar and grain. Candida relies on carbs for energy, and some research suggests that eating a lot of carbohydrates increases the number of Candida in your body. The assumption behind reducing carbs, particularly sugar, is that you will be able to deplete the yeast's energy source. As a result, when following the candida diet, you should limit or avoid the foods listed below:
All types of sugar, including honey, maple syrup, and molasses.
Fruits high in sugar, such as bananas, mangos, grapes, and dates.
Starchy vegetables (potatoes and carrots)
Gluten contains wheat, spelt, and rye grains.
Certain dairy products, such as cheese and milk
Meat that has been processed
Packaged foods (such as frozen meals and chips)
Fried or junk food.
Soda, coffee, fruit juice, energy drinks, caffeine-containing tea, and alcohol
The candida diet, on the other hand, favors low-sugar, low-carb foods that fight inflammation. These foods include:
Avocados, lemons, and limes are examples of fruits with low sugar content.
Non-starchy vegetables include artichokes, broccoli, kale, and tomatoes.
Gluten-free grains include teff, quinoa, and oat bran.
Ghee, Kefir, and Probiotic Yogurt
Lean meats, like chicken and turkey
Salmon and Sardines
Eggs
Avocado and olives.
Low-mold nuts and seeds, including hazelnuts, almonds, and sunflower seeds
Coconut, olive, sesame, and flaxseed oils
Herbs and spice

Some research suggests that probiotics are beneficial, so you may want to consider adding probiotic supplements or other probiotic foods to your diet.
