Stopping hair loss and encouraging natural hair growth requires a combination of lifestyle modifications, natural therapies, and good hair care techniques. This blog is a complete approach to addressing hair loss and promoting natural hair regrowth.
Understanding Hair Fall and Natural Regrowth
Hair grows everywhere on our skin, except on the palms and soles of the feet, eyelashes and navel, yet many hairs are so fine they are almost invisible. Hair is made of keratin, a protein made in hair follicles. As follicles develop new hair cells, old cells are pushed out through the skin's surface at a rate of approximately 6 inches every year. The visible hair is made up of dead keratin cells. The normal adult's head contains 100,000 to 150,000 hairs and loses up to 100 of them each day; spotting a few stray hairs on your brushes is not the necessary reason for concern.
Causes of Hair Fall
Hormones, including high amounts of androgens, which are naturally occurring male hormones produced by both men and women
Genes inherited from both male and female parents can influence a person's proclivity for male or female pattern baldness.
Stress, illness, and childbirth can all result in temporary
hair loss
. Ringworm, which is caused by a fungal infection, can lead to hair loss. Learn how you can reverse stress-induced hair loss.
Drugs such as chemotherapy, blood thinners, beta-adrenergic blockers for blood pressure control, and birth control pills can all cause temporary hair loss.
Burns, injuries, and X-rays can all result in temporary hair loss. In such cases, normal
hair growth
usually returns after the injury heals, unless a scar forms. Then the hair will never regrow.
Alopecia areata
may be caused by an autoimmune disease. Alopecia areata occurs when the immune system overreacts for unknown reasons and attacks the hair follicles. Most people with alopecia areata have hair that grows back, though it may be very fine and lighter in
hair color
at first before returning to normal coloration and thickness.
Cosmetic procedures such as over-shampooing, perms, bleaching, and dyeing hair can all contribute to hair thinning by making it weak and brittle. Tight braiding, using rollers or hot curlers, and putting hairpicks through tight curls can all cause hair damage and breakage. However, these procedures do not cause
baldness
. In most cases, removing the source of the problem causes the hair to regrow normally.
Thyroid disease, lupus, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, eating disorders, and anemia can cause hair loss. Most times, when the underlying condition is treated, the hair will return unless there is
scarring
, as in some forms of lupus, lichen planus, or follicular disorders.
A low-protein diet or severely calorie-restricted diet can also cause temporary hair loss. Get information about foods that can help prevent hair loss.
Deficiencies in vitamins A, B, C, D, and E, as well as iron and zinc, have been associated with hair loss.
The Hair Growth Cycle
Anagen
: It is the longest phase, lasting approximately 3 to 5 years for the hairs on your head. The anagen phase varies with the kind of hair. During the anagen phase, your hair follicles produce hairs that will continue to grow until they are cut or reach the end of their life and fall out.
Catagen: Hair follicles atrophy and growth decreases. The hair also separates from the bottom of the hair follicle but remains in situ during the last stages of growth. Approximately 5% of the hairs on your head are in the catagen phase at any given time.
Telogen
: The telogen phase normally lasts about three months. Approximately 10 to 15% of your scalp hairs are in this phase. During the telogen phase, hair does not grow and does not normally fall out. The telogen phase is also when new hairs begin to grow in follicles that have recently produced hairs during the catagen phase.
Exogen
: The exogen phase is simply an extension or component of the telogen phase of hair growth. During the exogen phase, hair sheds off the scalp, typically aided by washing and combing. It is common to lose between 50 and 100 hairs per day throughout the exogen period. During the exogen period, which can last 2 to 5 months, new hairs grow in the follicles while old ones fall out.
Natural Remedies to Stop Hair Fall
Massaging the scalp with
hair oils
and
hair masks
can increase hair thickness. Stretching during the massage can promote hair growth and thickness in the dermal papilla cells, which are found at the base of hair follicles. These cells are essential for hair regeneration and growth.
Aloe vera may assist in treating hair loss. Some anecdotal data suggests that aloe vera can aid by calming your scalp, moisturizing your hair, eliminating
dandruff
, and unclogging hair follicles.
Coconut oil includes lauric acid, a fatty acid that penetrates the hair shaft and reduces protein loss from it. It was also discovered that using coconut oil to the scalp may improve the microbiome of the scalp, making it healthier and promoting hair follicle growth. Coconut oil can be applied before or after washing your hair, depending on your hair type. If you have greasy hair, you can apply a leave-in treatment overnight or for a few hours before washing. Massage coconut oil into your scalp and hair. If you have dry hair, you can apply it as a leave-in treatment.

hair growth supplement
that may stimulate hair growth in adults with thinning hair. It is rich in minerals, including shark and mollusk powder, organic silica, vitamin C (produced from acerola cherry), biotin, and zinc. These chemicals may help to renew and strengthen existing cells.
Fish oil supplements are rich in nutrients such as proteins and omega-3 fatty acids. They discovered that taking an omega supplement, together with
antioxidants
, improved hair density, diameter, and hair loss. Omega-3 fatty acids may also help to decrease inflammation and strengthen immunity.

shampoo
and
conditioner
every day. However, avoid applying essential oils directly to the skin and instead mix them with a carrier oil or shampoo.

Or, you can mix 3 drops with 2 tablespoons of carrier oil, and leave it on for 15 minutes before rinsing it out.
