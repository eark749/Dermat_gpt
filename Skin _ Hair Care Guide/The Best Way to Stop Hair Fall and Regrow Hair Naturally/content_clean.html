<p><span>Hair grows everywhere on our skin, except on the palms and soles of the feet, eyelashes and navel, yet many hairs are so fine they are almost invisible. Hair is made of keratin, a protein made in hair follicles. As follicles develop new hair cells, old cells are pushed out through the skin's surface at a rate of approximately 6 inches every year. The visible hair is made up of dead keratin cells. The normal adult's head contains 100,000 to 150,000 hairs and loses up to 100 of them each day; spotting a few stray hairs on your brushes is not the necessary reason for concern.</span><span><br/></span><b></b></p>

<p>Hormones, including high amounts of androgens, which are naturally occurring male hormones produced by both men and women</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genes inherited from both male and female parents can influence a person's proclivity for male or female pattern baldness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stress, illness, and childbirth can all result in temporary <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-fall-hair-loss">hair loss</a>. Ringworm, which is caused by a fungal infection, can lead to hair loss. Learn how you can reverse stress-induced hair loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drugs such as chemotherapy, blood thinners, beta-adrenergic blockers for blood pressure control, and birth control pills can all cause temporary hair loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Burns, injuries, and X-rays can all result in temporary hair loss. In such cases, normal <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hair-regrow-serum%20">hair growth</a> usually returns after the injury heals, unless a scar forms. Then the hair will never regrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/alopecia-areata">Alopecia areata</a> may be caused by an autoimmune disease. Alopecia areata occurs when the immune system overreacts for unknown reasons and attacks the hair follicles. Most people with alopecia areata have hair that grows back, though it may be very fine and lighter in <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-colour">hair color</a> at first before returning to normal coloration and thickness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cosmetic procedures such as over-shampooing, perms, bleaching, and dyeing hair can all contribute to hair thinning by making it weak and brittle. Tight braiding, using rollers or hot curlers, and putting hairpicks through tight curls can all cause hair damage and breakage. However, these procedures do not cause <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/bald-patches">baldness</a>. In most cases, removing the source of the problem causes the hair to regrow normally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thyroid disease, lupus, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, eating disorders, and anemia can cause hair loss. Most times, when the underlying condition is treated, the hair will return unless there is <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">scarring</a>, as in some forms of lupus, lichen planus, or follicular disorders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>A low-protein diet or severely calorie-restricted diet can also cause temporary hair loss. Get information about foods that can help prevent hair loss.</span></p>

<b>The Hair Growth Cycle</b><b><br/></b>
</h3>
<div><img alt="The Hair Growth Cycle" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/The_Hair_Growth_Cycle_1_480x480.jpg?v=1725540016"/></div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Anagen</b><span>: It is the longest phase, lasting approximately 3 to 5 years for the hairs on your head. The anagen phase varies with the kind of hair. During the anagen phase, your hair follicles produce hairs that will continue to grow until they are cut or reach the end of their life and fall out.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span> Catagen: Hair follicles atrophy and growth decreases. The hair also separates from the bottom of the hair follicle but remains in situ during the last stages of growth. Approximately 5% of the hairs on your head are in the catagen phase at any given time.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Telogen</b><span>: The telogen phase normally lasts about three months. Approximately 10 to 15% of your scalp hairs are in this phase. During the telogen phase, hair does not grow and does not normally fall out. The telogen phase is also when new hairs begin to grow in follicles that have recently produced hairs during the catagen phase.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Exogen</b><span>: The exogen phase is simply an extension or component of the telogen phase of hair growth. During the exogen phase, hair sheds off the scalp, typically aided by washing and combing. It is common to lose between 50 and 100 hairs per day throughout the exogen period. During the exogen period, which can last 2 to 5 months, new hairs grow in the follicles while old ones fall out.</span></p>

Massage it into your scalp and leave it on for 5 minutes before thoroughly cleansing it with shampoo and conditioner.</span></p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

<p><b>Ylang-ylang essential oil</b><span>:</span> <span>While those with oily hair and skin would want to skip this one, ylang-ylang oil is ideal for those with <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/dry-scalp">dry scalp</a>, as it can stimulate sebum production. As a lack of oil and sebum causes hair to become dry and brittle, ylang-ylang can improve hair texture and reduce hair breakage.
