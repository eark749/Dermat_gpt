Silks are protein polymers made by insects such as silkworms, spiders, and bees. Silk fibres from distinct species have different fibroin sequences, structural characteristics, and primary sequences. The majority of silk is generated by two species of silkworms: no mulberry (wild variant) and domestic mulberry. Bombyx mori, a domesticated silkworm family, produces mulberry silk. In this blog, we will look at the next wave of skincare innovation from Silk Fibroin.
Unveiling the Silk Secret: Exploring the Wonders of Fibroin
