10 Must-Know Hair Terms: From Roots to Ends
Here are ten essential hair terms that cover everything from roots to ends:
The scalp is the skin on top of your head that contains hair follicles.  A healthy scalp is necessary for proper
hair growth.
Follicles are tiny sacs in the scalp from which individual hairs grow.  Every hair on your head originates from its follicle.
The cuticle is the outermost layer of each hair strand, made up of overlapping scales.  A smooth, intact cuticle layer promotes hair shine and protection.
The cortex is the middle layer of the hair shaft that contains keratin protein bundles that give the hair its strength, elasticity, and colour.
The medulla is the innermost layer of some hair shafts, but it may not be present in fine or light hair.  Its role in hair is not completely understood.
The cycle of hair growth, rest, and shedding occurs continuously.  Three phases make up the cycle: telogen (resting/shedding), catagen (transition), and anagen (growth).
Hair that has split into two or more strands at the ends due to damage to the hair shaft is known as split ends.  Split ends need to be trimmed off because they are a common indicator of hair damage.
Moisturising hair to maintain its softness, flexibility, and health is the process of hydration.  Hair that is well-hydrated is less likely to frizz, break, and become dry.
Detangling is the process of taking out tangles and knots from hair in order to reduce breakage and
hair loss
.  This procedure can be facilitated by using a detangling brush or wide-tooth comb.
The moisture-absorbing and moisture-retaining capacity of hair.  Hair porosity can be low (resists moisture absorption), normal, or high (easy to absorb and lose moisture). Understanding hair porosity allows you to tailor your hair care routines for maximum moisture retention.
These terms cover the fundamentals of hair anatomy, growth, health, and maintenance, providing a solid foundation for hair care and styling.
An In-Depth Look at Essential Haircare Vocabulary
Let us dig deeper into the essential haircare vocabulary:
Scalp
: The skin on the head where hair follicles are located.  A healthy scalp is essential for producing strong, vibrant hair growth.
Follicle
: The small sac within the scalp from which individual hairs grow. Each follicle produces a single hair strand.
Cuticle
: The outermost layer of each hair strand, made up of overlapping scales that protect the inner layers.  A smooth, intact cuticle improves hair shine and prevents damage.
Cortex
: The hair shaft's middle layer, which contains keratin protein bundles that determine hair strength, elasticity, and color.
Medulla
: The innermost layer of some hair shafts, but it may be absent in fine or
light-colored hair
.  Its function in hair is not completely understood.
Hair Growth Cycle
: The ongoing cycle of hair growth, rest, and shedding.  It has three phases: anagen (active growth), catagen (transition), and telogen (rest/shedding).
Porosity
: The moisture-absorbing and moisture-retaining capacity of hair.  High porosity hair has more open cuticles and may absorb moisture more quickly but find it difficult to hold onto it. Low porosity hair has tightly closed cuticles and may be resistant to moisture absorption.
Density
: The quantity of individual hair strands on the scalp.  Hair density can vary greatly between individuals, influencing hairstyle options and volume.
Texture
: The diameter or thickness of individual hair strands.  Hair texture is often classified as fine, medium, or coarse, and it influences how hair reacts to styling and products.
Elasticity
: The hair's capacity to elongate and then contract back to its initial length.  Healthy hair has good elasticity, whereas damaged hair is more likely to break when stretched.
Hydration
: The process of adding moisture to the hair to keep it soft, flexible, and healthy.  Hydrated hair is less prone to dryness, breakage, and frizzing.
Detangling
: The procedure of taking out tangles and knots from the hair to lessen breakage and reduce hair loss.  This procedure can be facilitated by using a detangling brush or wide-tooth comb.
Split ends
: Damage to the hair shaft that results in the ends of the hair breaking off into two or more strands.  Hair damage often manifests as split ends, which need to be trimmed to stop further splitting.

Trichology
: The scientific study of the health of the hair and scalp, encompassing diseases, remedies, and care regimens associated with these issues.
Anagen Phase
: The active growth phase of the hair cycle, during which hair follicles produce new hair cells and hair lengthens.
Catagen Phase
: The transitional stage of the hair growth cycle in which hair growth slows and follicles begin to shrink.
Telogen Phase
: The resting phase of the hair growth cycle in which hair follicles are dormant before shedding and restarting the cycle.
Hygral Fatigue
