Psoriasis and eczema are long-term skin disorders that cause flaky, irritated, and sometimes inflammatory skin. Although there isn't a treatment, there are several professional techniques that can help control flare-ups and offer relief. We look at some advice for treating psoriasis and eczema in this blog.
Introduction: Understanding Eczema and Psoriasis Flare-Ups
Eczema and psoriasis are chronic skin conditions that affect millions of people worldwide, causing discomfort, inflammation, and constant itching. While there is no cure for these conditions, effectively managing flare-ups is critical for improving the quality of life for people who have eczema or psoriasis.
Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a common skin condition characterised by red, itchy rashes that can appear all over the body. It usually starts in childhood but can continue into adulthood. Eczema flare-ups are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, with allergens, stress, and irritants playing significant roles.
Psoriasis is an autoimmune condition that causes rapid skin cell growth, resulting in thick, red patches with silvery scales. It can affect any part of the body and is frequently linked to joint pain (psoriatic arthritis). The exact cause is unknown, but genetics and the immune system are thought to be involved. Psoriasis flare-ups can be triggered by stress, infections, or certain medications.
Eczema and psoriasis both go through periods of remission followed by flare-ups. Flare-ups are sudden worsening of symptoms, such as increased redness, itching, and inflammation. Individuals suffering from these skin conditions must understand the triggers and implement management strategies to prevent flare-ups.
What Causes Eczema and Psoriasis to Flare Up?
Many things can cause flare-ups of psoriasis and eczema, and knowing what these things are is essential to managing the condition effectively. While the precise causes of various skin disorders are still unknown, some recognised factors have been linked to flare-ups. An overview of frequent causes of flare-ups for psoriasis and eczema can be found in this blog.

The Role of Skin Barrier Function in Eczema and Psoriasis
The skin barrier is critical to the development and progression of both eczema (atopic dermatitis) and psoriasis. A healthy skin barrier serves as a protective shield, preventing irritants, allergens, and pathogens from entering the skin. When the skin barrier is compromised, it can contribute to the development and progression of these skin conditions.
Skin Barrier Function in Eczema
:
Impaired Barrier Function
: Eczema patients typically have a compromised skin barrier, making them more vulnerable to irritants, allergens, and infections.
Reduced Moisture Retention
: Skin with eczema typically has a dry texture and is not able to hold onto moisture well. Inadequate hydration leads to skin sensitivity and irritation.
Inflammation and Itching
: The hallmark signs of eczema, such as inflammation, redness, and severe itching, can result from compromised skin barrier function. Scratching exacerbates the damage to the skin barrier, setting off a vicious cycle of irritation and redness.
Genetic Factors
: In people who are prone to eczema, genetic factors may have an impact on the integrity of the skin barrier. Skin barrier protein-related gene mutations may be a factor in barrier dysfunction.
Microbiome Imbalance
:
Eczema is linked to changes in the skin's microbiome, which is a community of microorganisms. Disruptions in the microbiome can impact the skin barrier and contribute to inflammation.
Skin Barrier Function in Psoriasis
:
Altered Epidermal Proliferation
: In psoriasis, there is an accelerated rate of skin cell turnover, leading to the formation of thick, scaly plaques. This altered proliferation disrupts the normal skin barrier function.
Increased Permeability
: Psoriatic skin exhibits increased permeability, allowing for easier penetration of irritants and allergens. The compromised barrier contributes to the inflammatory response seen in psoriasis.
Immune System Activation
: Psoriasis is characterised by a compromised skin barrier, which activates the immune system. Inflammatory cytokines are released, causing redness and scaling.
Genetic Factors
: Psoriasis development is influenced by genetic factors, specifically immune-related gene changes. Genetic factors affect the skin barrier and immune response.
Microbiome Influence
: Psoriasis is associated with changes in the skin microbiome. Changes in microbiome composition can affect the skin barrier and immune system.
Understanding the role of the skin barrier in eczema and psoriasis emphasises the importance of taking a holistic approach to skincare. By focusing on barrier repair, hydration, and minimising triggers, individuals can work towards managing these chronic skin conditions effectively with the guidance of healthcare professionals.
Anti-Inflammatory Approaches to Alleviate Symptoms
Anti-inflammatory treatments are essential for relieving the symptoms of chronic skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis. Both conditions result in inflammatory processes that cause skin irritation, redness, and discomfort. Here are some effective anti-inflammatory strategies for managing symptoms:
Topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, emollients and moisturisers, wet wrap therapy, bathing practices, dietary changes, anti-inflammatory supplements, and identifying and avoiding triggers are all treatments for eczema (atopic dermatitis).
Topical corticosteroids, topical retinoids, calcineurin inhibitors, phototherapy (light therapy), systemic medications, salicylic acid, coal tar preparations, dietary changes, stress management, and abstaining from alcohol and smoking are all options for Psoriasis treatment.
It is critical to collaborate closely with healthcare providers, including dermatologists, to determine the most appropriate anti-inflammatory approaches for each patient.  A personalised and comprehensive treatment plan typically includes a combination of topical treatments, lifestyle changes, and, in some cases, systemic medications. Regular monitoring and changes to the treatment plan may be required to effectively manage symptoms.
