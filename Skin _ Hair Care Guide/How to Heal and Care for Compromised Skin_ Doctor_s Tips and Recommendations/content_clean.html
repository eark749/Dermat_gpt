<h2><b> What is compromised skin and what causes it?</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="What is broken or compromised skin?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/DNA_testing_5_6eb36a67-15df-447c-ba8b-06ce6ea89343_480x480.png?v=1684999535"/></b></p>
<p><span>Skin that is weakened, injured, or dealing with numerous problems that interfere with its normal health and function is said to have compromised skin. Different symptoms, including dryness, redness, sensitivity, inflammation, and even open wounds, can be present. A variety of factors can contribute to compromised skin, including:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Environmental Factors</b><span>: Harsh weather conditions, such as extreme temperatures, low humidity, wind, or excessive sun exposure, can damage the skin's barrier function, resulting in dryness, redness, and sensitivity.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Irritants and Allergens</b><span>: Skin irritation, inflammation, and allergic reactions can occur when irritants and allergens, such as certain skincare products, cosmetics, fragrances, detergents, or fabrics, come into contact with the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Excessive Use of Harsh Products</b><span>: The balance of the skin's protective barrier can be upset by using excessive amounts of harsh cleansers, exfoliants, or treatments that remove the skin's natural oils.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skin conditions</b><span>: Skin problems like rosacea, eczema, dermatitis, and psoriasis can compromise the skin. These conditions frequently involve a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/damaged-sensitive-skin">damaged skin barrier</a>, itchiness, and inflammation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Allergic Reactions</b><span>: Allergic reactions to specific substances, such as foods, medications, and topical products, can compromise skin irritation and integrity.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Internal Factors</b><span>: Medical conditions, hormonal imbalances, or medications may also contribute to skin deterioration. For example, hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy or menopause can have an effect on the skin's condition.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Improper Skincare Techniques</b><span>: Using ineffective skin care methods, such as harsh exfoliation or scrubbing, can harm the skin and jeopardise its health.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>To choose the <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">best course of treatment</a> and care for compromised skin, it's critical to determine the underlying cause. A dermatologist or other medical expert can help diagnose the particular condition and suggest a customised strategy for healing and regaining the health of the skin. </span></p>
<h3><b>Understanding the skin barrier</b></h3>
<p><span>The outermost layer of skin, commonly referred to as the stratum corneum, serves as a barrier between the body and the outside world. It is known as the skin barrier. It is essential for preserving the integrity and health of the skin. Here are some essential ideas to comprehend regarding the skin barrier:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Structure</b><span>: Layers of dead skin cells called corneocytes embedded in a lipid matrix make up the skin barrier. The flat, compacted corneocytes on the surface of the skin create a barrier of protection.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Function</b><span>: The main job of the skin barrier is to shield the underlying tissues from outside influences like allergens, irritants, microbes, and moisture loss. It keeps the skin hydrated and stops dangerous substances from getting in.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Lipid Barrier</b><span>: Ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids make up the lipid matrix that makes up the skin barrier. These lipids support the integrity of the barrier and control the flow of water into and out of the skin. They are essential for halting moisture loss and preserving skin hydration.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>pH Balance</b><span>: The skin's natural pH balance has an impact on how well it serves as a barrier. The pH of the skin's surface is slightly acidic (between 4.5 and 5.5), which aids in preventing the development of dangerous bacteria and fungi.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Compromised Barrier</b><span>: When the skin barrier is compromised or damaged, it can lead to various skin issues. A compromised barrier may result in dryness, redness, sensitivity, increased water loss, increased susceptibility to irritants and allergens, and a higher risk of infections.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Factors Affecting the Barrier</b><span>: Harsh cleansers, over-exfoliation, excessive sun exposure, harsh weather conditions, specific skin conditions, genetics, ageing, and specific skincare products with an irritant or stripping ingredients can all negatively impact the integrity of the skin barrier.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Maintaining a Healthy Barrier</b><span>: It's critical to use proper skin care techniques in order to maintain a healthy skin barrier. This includes maintaining a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and adopting healthy lifestyle practices. It also includes gentle cleansing, moisturising, avoiding harsh products, shielding the skin from environmental stressors, and promoting overall skin health.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Maintaining healthy skin and resolving various skin issues requires an understanding of the skin barrier. You can encourage optimum skin health and function by supporting and safeguarding the skin's natural defences.</span></p>
<h3><b>Common triggers of skin sensitivity</b></h3>
<p><span>Skin sensitivity can result from a multitude of causes, and every individual has a unique response to it. The following are some typical causes of sensitive skin:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Environmental Factors</b><span>: Exposure to unfavourable climatic conditions, such as hot or low temperatures, low humidity, wind, or extensive sun exposure, can cause skin sensitivity and irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Allergens</b><span>: Some allergens, such as pollen, pet dander, mould, or particular foods, can make someone more sensitive to the sun and cause allergic reactions.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Irritants</b><span>: Skin sensitivity can develop as a result of exposure to irritating substances. These may include corrosive substances, strong scents, dyes, specific skincare products, detergents, or particular fabrics.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skincare Items</b><span>: Some skincare items, especially those that contain fragrances, preservatives, or specific active ingredients, can irritate sensitive skin and cause sensitivity reactions.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Over-exfoliation</b><span>: Exfoliation that is excessive or aggressive can damage the skin barrier and make the skin more sensitive.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Stress</b><span>: Emotional stress and anxiety can aggravate pre-existing skin conditions and increase skin sensitivity.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hormonal Changes</b><span>: The skin can become more sensitive and reactive when hormone levels fluctuate, such as during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Existing Skin Conditions</b><span>: People with eczema, dermatitis, rosacea, or psoriasis frequently have more sensitive skin and are more susceptible to sensitivity triggers.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Several medications</b><span>: Some medicines, including some retinoids, chemotherapeutic agents, and antibiotics, can increase the skin's sensitivity to outside influences.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Mechanical Factors</b><span>: Activities like vigorous towel drying, wearing tight clothing, or rough handling can cause friction, pressure, or rubbing on the skin, which can make it more sensitive.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Finding your specific skin sensitivity triggers and taking preventative measures to limit exposure to them is essential. Skin sensitivity can be controlled and lessened by avoiding known irritants, using gentle skincare products designed for sensitive skin, following a regular skincare routine, and shielding the skin from external stressors. A dermatologist should be seen if skin sensitivity persists or gets worse in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and recommendations.</span></p>
<h2><b>How to Care for Compromised Skin: Doctor’s Tips</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="What is broken or compromised skin?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/age-spots_480x480.jpg?v=1684999612"/></b></p>
<p><span>To help promote healing and restore the health of compromised skin, special attention and gentle care are needed. The following are some medical advice on how to treat compromised skin:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Cleanse Gently</b><span>: To gently cleanse compromised skin, use a mild, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-foaming-face-wash">fragrance-free cleanser</a>. To avoid further drying or irritation, choose lukewarm water instead of hot water. With a soft towel, pat the skin dry rather than rubbing it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Regularly moisturise</b><span>: After cleansing skin that has been damaged, use a mild, hypoallergenic moisturiser. Look for moisturisers that contain soothing ingredients like ceramides, hyaluronic acid, or aloe vera. Moisturising helps replenish the <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hydrasoothe-moisturiser">skin's moisture barrier</a> and soothes dryness or irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid Harsh Ingredients</b><span>: Avoid skincare products that may cause irritation because they contain scents, alcohol, dyes, or harsh chemicals. These may make already damaged skin worse. Choose items that are hypoallergenic or designed for sensitive skin instead.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sun Protection</b><span>: Cover weakened skin with a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 to protect it from the sun's damaging rays. Choose <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/what-is-zinc-oxide-in-sunscreen">zinc oxide</a> or titanium dioxide-based physical sunscreens instead, as these ingredients are typically well-tolerated by sensitive skin. Sunscreen should be reapplied every two hours or as directed.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reduce Irritation</b><span>: Steer clear of activities or products that might irritate or cause friction to vulnerable skin. The use of rough towels, harsh exfoliation, and excessive scrubbing are all prohibited. To reduce friction, choose soft fabrics for your clothing and bedding.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydrate from Within</b><span>: Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Proper hydration promotes overall skin health and can aid in wound healing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid Potential Triggers</b><span>: Identify and avoid potential triggers that can aggravate the condition of compromised skin.  This might involve particular foods, allergens, cosmetics, or environmental elements.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consult a Doctor</b><span>: If compromised skin persists, worsens, or is accompanied by severe symptoms, it is imperative to consult a dermatologist or other healthcare provider. They can offer an accurate diagnosis, suggest suitable treatments, or, if required, prescribe medications.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Keep in mind that these pieces of advice are only general suggestions and that specific situations may differ. For individualised guidance and treatment choices depending on your unique requirements and the severity of your impaired skin, speak with a healthcare professional.</span></p>
<h3><b>Gentle cleansing and moisturising tips</b></h3>
<p><span>Skincare must include both gentle washing and moisturising, especially for those with sensitive or impaired skin. Here are some pointers to remember:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Gentle Cleansing</strong>:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Use a Gentle Cleanser</b><span>: Select a gentle, fragrance-free cleanser designed specifically for sensitive skin. Look for cleansers that are non-comedogenic and hypoallergenic.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid Scrubbing</b><span>: When cleansing your face, be gentle. Avoid scrubbing with harsh brushes or sponges that can irritate the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Lukewarm Water</b><span>: To cleanse your face, use lukewarm water. Hot water can remove natural oils, causing dryness or irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Pat Dry</b><span>: After rinsing, use a soft towel to gently pat your skin dry. A rough drying technique should be avoided because it can irritate the skin even more. </span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span><strong>Moisturising</strong>:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Choose an Appropriate Moisturiser</b><span>: Look for moisturisers made especially for skin that is sensitive or compromised. Choose items devoid of fragrance, hypoallergenic, and harsh ingredients.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Apply Moisturizer to Damp Skin</b><span>: After cleansing, moisturise skin that is just a little bit damp. This promotes hydration and aids in retaining moisture.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Gentle Application</b><span>: When applying the moisturiser, make sure not to pull or rub the skin too hard. Instead, use small, upward strokes.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consider Emollients or Occlusives</b><span>: If your skin is extremely dry or damaged, use emollients or occlusive products. Emollients soften and smooth the skin, while occlusives form a protective barrier to prevent moisture loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Moisturise Twice Daily</b><span>: To keep your skin hydrated, apply moisturiser in the morning and evening, as well as as needed throughout the day.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Additional Suggestions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Patch Test</b><span>: Before attempting a new cleanser or moisturiser, test a small area of your skin for any adverse reactions.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Be Consistent</b><span>: Maintain skin health by sticking to a regular skincare routine and being consistent with cleansing and moisturising.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sun protection</b><span>: As part of your daytime skincare routine, always apply sunscreen with at least SPF 30 to protect your skin from harmful UV rays.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Remember that everyone's skin is unique, so pay attention to your skin's needs and adjust your skincare routine as needed. If you have specific questions or medical conditions, you should consult with a dermatologist or skincare expert to receive personalised advice.</span></p>
<h3><b>Recommended skincare ingredients</b></h3>
<p><span>There are numerous beneficial ingredients commonly found in skincare products that can address a variety of skin concerns. Here are some skincare ingredients to consider:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Hyaluronic Acid</b><span>: Hyaluronic acid, known for its excellent hydrating properties, attracts and retains moisture in the skin, promoting hydration and plumpness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Retinol</b><span>: A vitamin A derivative, retinol is a potent ingredient that can reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and uneven skin tone. It aids in the turnover of skin cells and the production of collagen.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Vitamin C</b><span>: As an antioxidant, vitamin C protects the skin from free radicals and promotes collagen synthesis. It can brighten the skin, fade hyperpigmentation, and even out the skin tone.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Niacinamide</b><span>: Also known as vitamin B3, niacinamide is a multitasking ingredient. It can help to strengthen the skin barrier, reduce inflammation, regulate oil production, and reduce the visibility of pores.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Peptides</b><span>: Peptides are short chains of amino acids that have the ability to increase collagen production, and enhance<a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/peptides-for-skin-benefits"> skin elasticity</a>, and firmness. They can support a smoother complexion and help to lessen the appearance of wrinkles.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Ceramides</b><span>: The skin's barrier is made up of ceramides, which are lipid molecules. They reinforce the skin's barrier of defence, aid in moisture retention, and stop moisture loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>AHA/BHA</b><span>: Chemical exfoliants known as alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) can help remove dead skin cells gently, clear clogged pores, and improve the texture of the skin. While BHAs are oil-soluble and can enter pores, AHAs are water-soluble and work on the skin's surface.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Antioxidants</b><span>: Antioxidants, such as coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, resveratrol, or green tea extract, assist in protecting the skin from environmental harm caused by free radicals, which can speed up the ageing process.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Peppermint Oil</b><span>: Peppermint oil has calming effects and can make the skin feel cool. It might assist in reducing inflammation and redness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Centella Asiatica (Cica)</b><span>: Centella Asiatica is a plant extract that has been shown to have calming and restorative effects. It can support the skin's natural barrier function, encourage wound healing, and soothe irritated skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Always remember to patch test and introduce new products gradually to your skincare regimen so you can watch how your skin reacts. To find the finest components and products for your particular skin conditions, it's also wise to speak with a dermatologist or skincare expert.</span></p>
<h3><b>Professional treatments for compromised skin</b></h3>
<p><span>Professional treatments can provide efficient answers to promote healing and restore skin health when it comes to treating weakened skin. Here are a few expert remedies that are frequently applied to compromised skin:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Chemical Peels</b><span>: A chemical solution is applied to the skin to exfoliate the top layer of the skin, accelerating cell renewal and enhancing skin texture. They can help with problems like dryness, hyperpigmentation, and uneven skin tone. However, it is critical to select a gentle peel appropriate for compromised skin and to follow the advice of a dermatologist or skin care professional.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Laser Therapy</b><span>: By targeting specific skin concerns such as redness, acne scars, or sun damage, laser treatments can be beneficial for compromised skin. Laser therapy promotes skin rejuvenation by stimulating collagen production, decreasing inflammation, and reducing inflammation. A qualified professional should, however, determine the type and intensity of laser treatment based on the individual's skin condition and needs. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Microdermabrasion</b><span>: Microdermabrasion is the use of a device to exfoliate the skin's outer layer, improving texture and promoting cell turnover. It can aid in the treatment of dryness, roughness, and mild hyperpigmentation. However, it is critical to avoid aggressive microdermabrasion and instead opt for a gentle approach suitable for sensitive skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>LED Therapy</b><span>: LED (Light Emitting Diode) therapy targets specific skin concerns by using different wavelengths of light. It can help reduce inflammation, stimulate collagen production, and improve overall skin health. LED therapy is generally safe and suitable for people with sensitive skin, but it is best to seek professional advice for the best results.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Facial Treatments</b><span>: Professional facial treatments designed for troubled skin can be calming and nourishing. These treatments frequently include gentle cleansing, exfoliation, hydrating masks, and sensitive skin moisturisers. The emphasis is on rebalancing the skin and promoting healing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Topical Medications</b><span>: A dermatologist may prescribe topical medications or creams in some cases to treat specific skin concerns associated with compromised skin, such as inflammation, infection, or certain dermatological conditions.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It's important to remember that the effectiveness of these expert treatments can vary depending on the severity and specifics of the skin problem, as well as the individual's overall health. Seek the advice of a dermatologist or other skincare expert who can examine your skin and make personalised recommendations for the best treatments for your ailing skin.</span></p>

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Stress Management</b><span>: Investigate various stress management techniques such as journaling, spending time in nature, participating in hobbies, or connecting with loved ones. Chronic stress can have an effect on the skin, so learning healthy stress management techniques can help with overall skin health.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Adequate Sleep</b><span>: Make quality sleep a priority as part of your skincare routine. Create a relaxing bedtime routine, and a comfortable sleeping environment, and make sure you get enough restorative sleep. Sleep is essential for skin repair and renewal.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Self-Care and Well-Being</b><span>: Engage in self-care and well-being activities such as taking relaxing baths, practising self-massage, or indulging in nourishing face masks. Prioritising self-care can benefit both your mental health and your skin health.</span></p>

<p><span>Even on cloudy days, use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Use a generous amount of sunscreen and reapply it every two hours, or more frequently if you're sweating or swimming.  </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>To protect your skin from the sun's rays, dress in protective clothing such as long sleeves, wide-brimmed hats, and sunglasses.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The best time to find shade is between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid Irritating Ingredients</b><span>: Be mindful of the ingredients in the skincare products you use and steer clear of those that could aggravate already sensitive skin. This includes abrasive chemicals, scents, and synthetic colours. Look for products designed especially for delicate or compromised skin that are mild, fragrance-free, and hypoallergenic.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydrate</b><span>: For overall skin health, proper hydration is crucial. Throughout the day, sip on plenty of water to stay hydrated and support healthy skin. Skin that is properly hydrated can repair damage and keep up a strong barrier.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Healthy Eating</b><span>: Choose a well-balanced diet that is high in fresh produce, whole grains, lean proteins, and good fats. These nutrient-rich foods offer vital vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that promote the health and healing of the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Manage Stress</b><span>: Long-term stress can aggravate skin conditions. Reduce stress and promote relaxation by using stress management techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or engaging in activities you enjoy.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Gentle Cleansing</b><span>: Use mild, non-irritating cleansers to cleanse your skin. Avoid using harsh soaps or cleansers that can strip the skin of its natural oils and disrupt the skin barrier. Choose gentle cleansers made specifically for sensitive or compromised skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Moisturise on a regular basis</b><span>: Keeping your skin hydrated and moisturised will help it heal and restore the skin barrier. Choose fragrance-free, non-comedogenic moisturisers with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid or ceramides.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid Using Hot Water</b><span>: Hot water can be drying and irritate already sensitive skin. When washing your face or showering, use lukewarm water to avoid removing the skin's natural moisture.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Gentle Exfoliation</b><span>: If your skin tolerates exfoliation, choose methods such as chemical exfoliants (e.g., AHAs or BHAs) or gentle scrubs. Exfoliation that is too harsh or excessive can damage the skin barrier and exacerbate skin sensitivity.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid Smoking and Limit Alcohol Consumption</b><span>: Both smoking and excessive alcohol consumption can have a negative impact on skin health and healing. To help your skin recover, stop smoking and limit your alcohol intake.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Always seek the advice of a dermatologist or other healthcare provider for customised advice suited to your needs and skin condition. They can offer personalised guidance and suggest suitable dietary and skincare regimens to take care of your damaged skin.</span></p>
<h3><b>Sun protection for sensitive skin</b></h3>
<p><span>Due to its propensity to be more reactive and irritable, sensitive skin requires extra attention when it comes to sun protection. Following are some recommendations for shielding delicate skin from the sun:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Select a gentle sunscreen</b><span>: Look for a broad-spectrum sunscreen that contains physical filters such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. These ingredients are less likely to cause skin irritation compared to chemical sunscreens. Choose a sunscreen that has been specially formulated for sensitive skin and is hypoallergenic and fragrance-free.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>SPF and Application</b><span>: Be sure to use sunscreen that has a minimum SPF of 30 and to liberally apply it to all exposed skin. Don't forget about the hands, neck, and other frequently forgotten body parts. If you are swimming or perspiring, reapply every two hours or more frequently.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sun-Protective Clothing</b><span>: Wear protective clothing such as long-sleeved shirts, wide-brimmed hats, and sunglasses with UV protection. Sun protection clothing with a tight weave or a UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) rating can help.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Seek Shade</b><span>: Avoid direct sun exposure between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Seek shade under umbrellas, trees, or wear wide-brimmed hats for added protection.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid Irritating Ingredients</b><span>: Read the ingredient lists on sunscreen and other sun protection products.  Avoid common irritants such as alcohol, perfumes, and harsh chemicals. Look for formulations that are gentle, hypoallergenic, and suitable for sensitive skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Patch Test</b><span>: Before applying a new sunscreen or sun protection product to your skin, perform a patch test to check for any adverse reactions or sensitivity.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reconsider Chemical Sunscreens</b><span>: If your sensitive skin reacts to chemical sunscreens, opt for physical sunscreens that contain zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. These sunscreens with mineral ingredients are less likely to irritate the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cleaning Gently</b><span>: After being exposed to the sun, gently cleanse your skin using a mild, fragrance-free cleanser made specifically for skin that is sensitive. Avoid rubbing or using abrasive cleansers that can aggravate the skin even more.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Moisturise and Soothe</b><span>: Apply a gentle, fragrance-free moisturiser after cleansing to help soothe and hydrate your skin. Look for moisturisers that contain calming ingredients such as aloe vera, chamomile, or oat extract.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skin Checks on a Regular Basis</b><span>: Keep an eye on your skin for any changes, new moles, or suspicious spots. If you notice any concerning changes, see a dermatologist for an evaluation.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Remember that everyone's skin is unique, so finding sun protection products that are effective for your specific needs is essential.  If you have severe skin sensitivities or concerns, consult a dermatologist for personalised advice and recommendations.</span></p>
<h3><b>Lifestyle changes to support skin health</b></h3>
<p><span>Changing key aspects of one's lifestyle can encourage healthy skin and contribute to overall skin health. Consider some of the following lifestyle choices:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>A diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats is recommended. The vital vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fatty acids in these nutrient-rich foods support the health of the skin. Reduce your intake of processed foods, sugary snacks, and beverages because these can exacerbate skin problems and inflammation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your body and skin hydrated. Water helps to keep the skin moist, supports skin cell function, and aids in the removal of toxins.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Get enough quality sleep each night because sleep is essential for skin rejuvenation and repair. Create a sleep-friendly environment, establish a regular sleep routine, and aim for 7-9 hours of uninterrupted sleep per night.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Chronic stress can have a detrimental impact on your skin by causing more inflammation and skin problems. To lower stress levels and enhance general wellbeing, try stress-reduction practises including exercise, meditation, deep breathing, or participating in activities you enjoy.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Exercise on a regular basis to support the health of your skin overall and to improve blood circulation and oxygenation. Exercise promotes a more youthful appearance and aids in stress management.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Sunscreen, finding shade, and wearing protective clothing can all help to shield your skin from the sun's damaging rays. Overexposure to the sun increases the risk of developing skin cancer, sunburn, and early ageing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Smoking harms collagen and elastin fibres, hastens ageing, and causes a number of skin problems. Similar to how drinking too much alcohol causes the skin to become dehydrated and lose its ability to function normally. If you smoke, give it up, and only occasionally drink alcohol.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Cleansing, moisturising, and protecting your skin should all be part of a gentle skincare routine. Use gentle, fragrance-free skin care products that are appropriate for your skin type, and avoid harsh ingredients that may cause irritation or inflammation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Avoid touching your face as much as possible throughout the day to lessen the transfer of bacteria, oils, and dirt that can cause breakouts and other skin problems. Before using skincare products, thoroughly clean your hands.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Makeup brushes, sponges, and other tools should be cleaned and replaced on a regular basis to avoid the accumulation of bacteria and dirt that can cause skin irritation or breakouts. To maintain their efficacy and prevent potential contamination, replace makeup products when they are no longer needed.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Keep in mind that it could take some time for lifestyle changes to show up on your skin. Patience and consistency are essential. Consult a dermatologist or skincare expert if you have certain skin issues for individualised guidance and suggestions.</span></p>
