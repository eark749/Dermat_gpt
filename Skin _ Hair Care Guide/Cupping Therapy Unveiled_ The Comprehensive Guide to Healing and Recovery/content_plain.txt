Understanding Cupping Therapy: Foundations and Methods
Cupping therapy is an old healing technique that includes applying cups to the skin to produce suction. This therapy, founded on traditional Chinese medicine principles, has been used for generations to promote healing, enhance circulation, and relieve pain. This blog provides a basic explanation of cupping therapy, including methodology and advantages.
What is Cupping Therapy and How Does It Work?
Cupping treatment is an old medicinal practice that includes applying cups to the skin to produce suction. This suction pulls the skin upward into the cup, which can have a variety of therapeutic benefits. Cupping therapy is based on traditional medicine systems such as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and has been used for centuries to promote healing and treat a variety of diseases.
Types of Cupping Therapy:
Dry Cupping
: Dry cupping involves placing cups on the skin and creating a vacuum to suck the skin upwards into the cup. Cups can be constructed of glass, silicone, plastic, or bamboo. Dry cupping can be done using a variety of techniques, including stationary cupping (when cups are left in place for a few minutes) and movement cupping.
Wet Cupping
: Wet cupping is the process of making small incisions in the skin following dry cupping. The cups are then reapplied to pull out a small quantity of blood. Wet cupping is thought to help eliminate toxins from the body and promote healing.

Fire cupping has similar benefits to dry cupping, including improved circulation and muscle relaxation. Some practitioners feel that the heat of fire cupping enhances therapeutic outcomes.
