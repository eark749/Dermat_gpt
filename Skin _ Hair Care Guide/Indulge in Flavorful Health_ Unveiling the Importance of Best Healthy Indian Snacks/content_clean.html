<p><b>Protein</b><span>: Many Indian snacks, such as lentils, chickpeas, nuts, seeds, and yoghurt, are high in protein. Protein is required for the formation and repair of tissues, the support of immune function, and the maintenance of healthy hair, skin, and nails.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Fibre</b><span>: Whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables are excellent sources of dietary fibre in Indian snacks.  Fibre improves digestive health, aids in blood sugar regulation, and contributes to feelings of fullness and satiety.</span></p>
</li>

<p><b>Calcium</b><span>: Dairy-based snacks, such as yogurt-based dishes, can help with calcium intake, which is beneficial to bone health and muscle function.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Omega-3 Fatty Acids</b><span>: Some Indian snacks, particularly those containing nuts and seeds such as flaxseeds and walnuts, contain plant-based sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which are good for heart and brain health.</span></p>

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Complex Carbohydrates</b><span>: Whole grains used in Indian snacks provide complex carbohydrates, which provide a steady release of energy while also supporting overall health.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Fiber-Rich Snacks: Promoting Digestive Health and Satiety</b></h3>
<p><span>Fiber-rich foods are great for improving digestive health and increasing feelings of fullness. Dietary fibre, a form of carbohydrate found in plant-based meals, is critical for digestive health and overall well-being. Fibre has several health benefits when mixed into snacks:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Improved Digestion</b><span>: Fibre adds bulk to stool, making it easier to pass through the digestive tract. This promotes regular bowel movements and prevents constipation, thereby supporting a healthy digestive system.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Gut Health</b><span>: Fibre acts as a prebiotic, feeding beneficial gut bacteria. A healthy gut microbiome is necessary for proper digestion, nutrient absorption, and immune system function.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Blood Sugar Control</b><span>: Fibre slows sugar absorption, which helps to keep blood glucose levels stable. This is especially useful for people who have diabetes or want to control their blood sugar levels.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Satiety and Weight Management</b><span>: High-fiber snacks are more filling and satisfying than low-fiber options.  Including fibre in snacks can help you control your appetite, reduce overeating, and achieve your weight-loss goals.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Heart Health</b><span>: By binding to cholesterol and expelling it from the body, soluble fibre, which is present in foods like oats and legumes, can help lower cholesterol levels. This lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease and promotes heart health. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reduced Risk of Chronic Diseases</b><span>: Research has linked a diet high in fibre to a lower risk of developing chronic diseases like obesity, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Detoxification</b><span>: Certain fibres can help the body detoxify by binding to toxins and wastes and facilitating their elimination.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Protein-Packed Snacks: Building Blocks for Muscle Health and Repair</b></h3>

<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Muscle Repair and Growth</b><span>: Protein is essential for muscle repair and growth. After physical activity or exercise, consuming protein aids in the body's ability to repair damaged muscle fibres and fosters the growth and strength of muscles.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Satiety and Weight Management</b><span>: Protein-rich snacks are often more satisfying and filling than carbohydrate-heavy snacks. Including protein in your snacks can aid in satiety, lower calorie intake overall, and support weight loss objectives.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Energy Source</b><span>: While carbohydrates are the body's primary energy source, protein can be used for energy when carbohydrates are scarce. Protein-rich snacks can help maintain energy levels between meals or during strenuous physical activity.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Immune Function</b><span>: Many immune cells rely on proteins to function properly. Consuming enough protein promotes immune health, assisting the body in fighting infections and illnesses.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hormone Regulation</b><span>: Proteins play a role in hormone synthesis and regulation, contributing to various physiological processes, including metabolism and stress response.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Tissue Repair</b><span>: Protein is required for the repair and maintenance of various body tissues, including skin, hair, and nails.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Enzyme and Enzyme Production</b><span>: Many enzymes in the body are proteins that participate in important chemical reactions that aid digestion, metabolism, and other bodily functions.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Micronutrients in Healthy Indian Snacks: Vitamins and Minerals</b></h3>
<p><span>Healthy Indian snacks can be high in critical vitamins and minerals, which play important roles in general health and well-being.

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Vitamin A</b><span>: Vitamin A-rich snacks include carrots, sweet potatoes, and mangoes. Vitamin A is necessary for healthy vision, immune function, and skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Vitamin E</b><span>: Nuts, seeds, and oils (such as almonds and sunflower seeds) contain vitamin E, an antioxidant that protects cells from damage and promotes skin health.</span></p>

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Iron</b><span>: Dried fruits such as raisins and apricots, as well as lentils and leafy greens, can provide iron. Iron is essential for oxygen transport in the body and helps with energy production.</span></p>
