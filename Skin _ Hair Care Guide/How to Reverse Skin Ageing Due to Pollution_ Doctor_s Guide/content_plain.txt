Pollution is an issue that we have been facing for a long time now. Those living and working in major urban cities are exposed to toxic substances on the skin, including tiny particles called PMs, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). It hurts our skin, hair, and overall health. In this article, we will discuss how air pollution affects your skin and how you can reverse ageing due to pollution by taking preventive action and following the right skincare routine.
Does air pollution affect your skin?
Skin problems caused by air pollution can include:
Acne
Skin allergies
Psoriasis
Air pollution causes these skin issues because it can irritate the human skin, especially its upper layer, called epidermis. The human skin is constantly exposed to environmental factors such as UV light, dirt, and other microorganisms that may cause inflammation or infection. To avoid this happening, the human body has developed a barrier function that consists of a lipid layer called stratum corneum (SC) on top of SC cells. When pollutants enter our bodies through inhalation or ingestion, they reach this protective layer, where some may be absorbed into our bloodstream while others remain trapped underneath SC cells. Agents with a very irritating effect (e.g. sulphur dioxide SO2), once they get into our bodies, activate multiple pathways of inflammation within them (e.g., keratinocytes). Some pathways ignite melanocytes which produce too much
pigment
and end up giving you unwanted sun spots, while others increase production of mucus in your nose, causing runny noses, etc.
Understanding the impact of environmental pollutants
Environmental pollutants can have a significant impact on hair and scalp health due to exposure to various harmful substances found in the air, water, and surroundings. Here's a rundown of the effects of environmental pollutants on hair:
Air Pollution
:
Particulate Matter (PM)
: Fine particles from vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, and smoke can settle on the scalp and hair, causing dryness, irritation, and potential cuticle damage.
Chemical Compounds
: Harmful chemicals in the air, such as sulphates, nitrogen dioxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), can strip natural oils from the hair, resulting in dryness, frizziness, and increased breakage vulnerability.
Water Quality
:
Chlorine and Hard Water
: Both chlorine in tap water and minerals in hard water can cause scalp irritation, and dryness, and strip the hair of its natural oils, leaving it dry, brittle, and prone to breakage.
UV Radiation
:
Sun Exposure
: Prolonged exposure to UV radiation can damage the hair cuticle, resulting in dryness, discoloration, and weakened hair structure. UV rays can also degrade proteins in the hair, making it brittle.
Climate Factors
:
Humidity
: High humidity levels can cause frizz and excessive moisture absorption by the hair, whereas low humidity levels can cause dryness and brittleness.
Extreme Temperatures
: Cold weather can cause dry scalp and hair, whereas heat can cause dehydration and potential hair shaft damage.
Impact on Hair Health
:
Dryness and Brittleness
: Environmental pollutants can strip natural oils from the scalp and hair, resulting in dry, brittle hair that is more prone to breakage.
Scalp Irritation
: Pollutants can cause scalp irritation, itchiness, redness, and conditions like
dandruff
or
eczema
.
Hair Loss
: Prolonged exposure to pollutants may contribute to hair thinning or exacerbate existing hair loss conditions by increasing oxidative stress and inflammation in the scalp.
Protecting Hair from Environmental Damage
:
Regular Cleaning
: Use gentle shampoos to cleanse the hair and scalp to remove pollutants, dirt, and buildup.
Hydration and conditioning
: Restore moisture and nourish the hair with conditioners and hydrating masks to prevent dryness and damage.
Protective measures
: When exposed to sunlight for prolonged periods, wear hats or use UV-protecting hair products.
Filtered Water
: To reduce the effects of hard minerals and chlorine, think about washing your hair with filtered or soft water.
Antioxidant Products
: To counteract oxidative stress brought on by pollutants, think about utilising antioxidant-containing hair care products.
Reducing Exposure
: To lessen direct contact with pollutants, wear protective hairstyles or limit your exposure to polluted environments.
Protective measures against pollution-induced skin damage
It is critical to protect your skin from pollution-induced damage to retain its health and attractiveness. Here are some precautions you may take to reduce the effects of environmental contaminants on your skin:
Cleansing Routine
: Use a potent
cleanser
to get rid of any debris, pollutants, and makeup that have accumulated on your skin during the day. Consider starting with an oil-based cleanser and then switching to a gentle water-based cleanser.
Antioxidant Skincare
: To combat free radicals caused by pollution and reduce oxidative stress on the skin, use skincare products containing antioxidants (such as
Vitamin C
, Vitamin E, green tea extract, or niacinamide).
Barrier Protection
: Use a
moisturiser
to coat your skin in a shield that keeps impurities from getting through and irritating or drying it out. To protect your skin from UV rays and reduce the effects of pollution-induced oxidative stress, apply broad-spectrum
sunscreen
with an SPF of 30 or higher every day.
Avoid Touching Face
: To stop bacteria or pollutants from spreading from your hands to your skin, try not to touch your face too often.
Protective Clothing
: To reduce direct exposure to pollutants and UV radiation when you are outside, wear hats, scarves, or clothing that covers your skin.
Regular Skincare
: To keep your skin clear, moisturised, and protected, create and stick to a regular skincare regimen that is appropriate for your skin type.
Hydration and Nutrition
: To keep your skin hydrated from the inside out and flush out toxins, make sure you drink plenty of water. Omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and antioxidants are abundant in a balanced diet, which you should follow to maintain the general health of your skin.
Air Quality
: To reduce exposure to indoor pollutants and enhance indoor air quality, think about installing air purifiers inside.
Post-Exposure Care
: After heavy pollution exposure, consider using a detoxifying mask or a gentle exfoliant to remove impurities and rejuvenate your skin.
Regular Cleansing of Personal Items
: To prevent bacterial buildup and pollution transfer, clean items that come into contact with your face regularly, such as phones, pillowcases, and makeup brushes.
Adopting these protective measures and sticking to a consistent skincare routine can help reduce the impact of pollution on your skin, keeping it healthy, radiant, and less vulnerable to environmental pollutants.
How to reverse skin ageing due to pollution
Reversing the skin damage caused by pollution can be difficult, but there are several steps you can take to help improve the health of your skin.
Apply sunscreen every day
: Sunscreen is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself from pollution-related skin damage. Make sure to use a broad-spectrum
sunscreen
with SPF 30 or higher, and apply it liberally when going outside for an extended period (1 teaspoon per arm and leg). A good rule of thumb is that you should reapply your sunscreen every two hours while outdoors, even if it's only cloudy outside.
Hydrate
: Drink plenty of water and keep your body hydrated.
Cleanse your skin gently
: Gentle washing can help to remove pollution, makeup, and other substances without irritating the skin.
Wear a mask when going out in polluted areas
: While this may not seem like an obvious solution to reversing the effects on your skin caused by air pollution, wearing a face mask when exposed to high levels of particulate matter can help reduce some of its negative impact on your complexion in addition to protecting against other types of pollutants (such as heavy metals or pesticides) that might otherwise become absorbed into your bloodstream through inhalation over time.
Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet:
Avoid eating unhealthy foods such as processed meats and fried foods often used in fast food establishments around high-traffic areas where large crowds gather regularly because these items tend to not only contain high levels of fat but also sodium, which causes dehydration, which results in dryness, which ultimately causes wrinkles at those points where skin folds together, such as the corners between the brows and eyes, the corners between the nose and upper lip, and sides of mouth near chin area.
Is skin ageing reversible?
As you can see, air pollution can be a serious detriment to your skin. If signs of ageing due to pollution bother you, you may want to see a
dermatologist
. At
Clinikally
you can take
online dermatologist consultation
which can provide personalised treatment plans based on your specific skin concern. There are steps that you can take to help reverse skin ageing and keep your skin looking young and healthy.
As we age, skin becomes drier and loses collagen and elasticity. This causes wrinkles to form around our eyes, mouth, and cheeks. To prevent this from happening, use a good-quality moisturiser every day before you go to bed. If your skin is already dry or wrinkled, then use an oil-based one instead of a water-based one, as they penetrate deeply into the layers of your skin keeping it hydrated all night long without causing breakouts!
Protect yourself from pollution with sunscreen! If you're going outside for more than 15 minutes in sunny weather then make sure that you put on sunscreen every time! Sunscreen works by absorbing harmful UV rays that cause sunburns, which can lead to premature ageing as well as cancer, so keep applying it every few hours throughout the day if needed! Don't forget about those hidden parts too, like underneath your arms or neck, so remember to wear something protective when outdoors during the summer months unless otherwise specified by a dermatologist such as SPF 50+.
Anti-pollution skincare routines
An anti-pollution skincare routine focuses on protecting your skin from environmental pollutants by using specific products and practices. Here's a comprehensive guide to an anti-pollution skincare routine:
Morning Routine
:
Gentle Cleanser
: Use a mild, water-based cleanser to remove impurities and pollutants accumulated overnight. This helps prepare the skin for subsequent skincare steps.
Vitamin C Serum
: Apply a Vitamin C serum to neutralise free radicals caused by pollution and UV radiation, helping to brighten and protect the skin.
Antioxidant Moisturizer
: Use a moisturiser containing antioxidants like Vitamin E or green tea extract to hydrate and shield the skin from pollutants. Look for products with added SPF for extra protection against UV rays.
Broad-Spectrum Sunscreen
: Apply sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher to protect your skin from UV damage and minimise the impact of pollution-induced oxidative stress throughout the day.
Daytime Care
:
Sun Protection
: Reapply sunscreen every 2-3 hours if you're exposed to the sun for an extended period or if you're in a highly polluted area.
Refreshing Mist
: Consider using an antioxidant-infused facial mist throughout the day to refresh your skin and provide an extra layer of protection against pollutants.
Evening Routine:
Double Cleansing
: Use an oil-based cleanser to remove makeup, sunscreen, and pollutants that have accumulated throughout the day. After cleansing the skin, use a gentle water-based cleanser to remove any remaining impurities.

Hydration and Repair
: Use a hydrating serum or treatment with reparative properties to replenish moisture and repair the skin barrier, thereby increasing its resistance to pollutants.
Night Cream or Treatment
: While sleeping, use a
night cream
or treatment rich in antioxidants, peptides, or retinoids to support skin repair and counteract pollution damage.
Additional Tips:
Remove Makeup
: Thoroughly remove all makeup before cleansing to prevent pollutants from becoming trapped beneath makeup layers.
Lead a Healthy Lifestyle
: To promote general skin health and resilience against environmental stressors, keep hydrated, eat a balanced diet, and get enough sleep.
This routine should be tailored to your skin type, concerns, and environmental exposure. It is best to patch-test new products and consult with a dermatologist or skincare professional to create a routine that is tailored to your skin's specific needs.
Advanced treatments for pollution-related skin ageing
Pollution can accelerate oxidative stress, collagen degradation, and inflammation, all of which contribute to skin ageing. Several advanced treatments can aid in the treatment of pollution-related skin ageing concerns:
Antioxidant Infusions
:
Intravenous (IV) or intradermal antioxidant treatments deliver large amounts of antioxidants directly into the bloodstream or skin, assisting in the fight against free radicals and oxidative stress caused by pollutants.
Laser and Light Therapies
: Fractional laser treatments stimulate collagen production, reduce pigmentation, and improve skin texture, addressing signs of ageing caused by pollution. IPL treatments target pigmentation caused by environmental damage, even out skin tone, and reduce age spots.
Chemical Peels
: Chemical peels exfoliate the skin, removing damaged outer layers and stimulating collagen production to reduce fine lines and wrinkles caused by pollution.
Microdermabrasion
: Microdermabrasion removes dead skin cells while also stimulating collagen production, improving skin texture, and reducing the appearance of fine lines and uneven pigmentation.
Radiofrequency and Ultrasound Treatments
: RF treatments stimulate collagen production, tighten the skin, and improve elasticity, thereby reducing the visible effects of pollution-induced ageing. Ultrasound therapy increases collagen production while lifting and tightening the skin, addressing sagging caused by environmental stressors.
Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy
: PRP treatments use the patient's plasma, which is rich in growth factors, to rejuvenate the skin, improve texture, and boost collagen synthesis, thereby combating pollution-induced ageing.
Injectable Treatments
: Fillers based on
hyaluronic acid
replenish volume lost due to environmental damage and smooth wrinkles. By relaxing facial muscles, injections of neurotoxin can lessen the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles brought on by environmental stressors and repetitive facial movements.
Skincare Infusions
: High-end serums and masks enhanced with powerful antioxidants, peptides, or growth factors can aid in the restoration of damaged skin and shield it from the damaging effects of pollution.
Personalised Skincare Regimen
: To address pollution-induced ageing and protect the skin, dermatologists may recommend antioxidants, retinoids, or specialty topical treatments.

Effectively treat wrinkles and fine lines!
With all that pollution around, your skin is doing a good job of trying to keep itself protected. However, that can lead to clogged pores and make you look older than you are. To reverse the effects of air pollution on your skin, it's important to use a good moisturiser each day. This will help prevent dryness and flaking in even the most polluted areas.
Then some specific skincare products can help: sunscreen is always important, but especially if you're in an area with heavy pollution;
retinol
can be used as an anti-ageing product (but also works well against pollutants); peptides work as both antioxidants and anti-pollution agents; vitamin C helps protect against UV damage while also working against pollutants; and finally, cleansers are key in removing dirt from pores so they don't become blocked by oil residue or dust particles.
Topical treatments for reducing wrinkles
Topical treatments that target fine lines, wrinkles, and signs of ageing are frequently used to reduce wrinkles. Here are some effective topical treatments for wrinkle reduction:
Retinoids (Retinol, Tretinoin)
:
Benefits
: Retinoids improve skin texture, encourage cell turnover, and increase collagen production, which minimises the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Usage
: To reduce irritation, start with a low concentration and increase frequency gradually as tolerated. Apply at night, as retinoids can increase sensitivity to sunlight.
Vitamin C Serums
:
