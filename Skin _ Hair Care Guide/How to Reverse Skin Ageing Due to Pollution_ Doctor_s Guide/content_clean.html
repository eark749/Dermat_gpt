<p><span>Pollution is an issue that we have been facing for a long time now. Those living and working in major urban cities are exposed to toxic substances on the skin, including tiny particles called PMs, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). It hurts our skin, hair, and overall health. In this article, we will discuss how air pollution affects your skin and how you can reverse ageing due to pollution by taking preventive action and following the right skincare routine.</span></p>
<h2><b>Does air pollution affect your skin?</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Does air pollution affect your skin?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/108_29e8ebe3-ba1d-4ed6-9e18-14e521d6879f_480x480.png?v=1702633292"/></div>
<p><span>Skin problems caused by air pollution can include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Acne</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Skin allergies</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/psoriasis"><span>Psoriasis</span></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Air pollution causes these skin issues because it can irritate the human skin, especially its upper layer, called epidermis. The human skin is constantly exposed to environmental factors such as UV light, dirt, and other microorganisms that may cause inflammation or infection. To avoid this happening, the human body has developed a barrier function that consists of a lipid layer called stratum corneum (SC) on top of SC cells. When pollutants enter our bodies through inhalation or ingestion, they reach this protective layer, where some may be absorbed into our bloodstream while others remain trapped underneath SC cells. Agents with a very irritating effect (e.g. sulphur dioxide SO2), once they get into our bodies, activate multiple pathways of inflammation within them (e.g., keratinocytes). Some pathways ignite melanocytes which produce too much <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">pigment</a> and end up giving you unwanted sun spots, while others increase production of mucus in your nose, causing runny noses, etc.</span></p>
<h3><b>Understanding the impact of environmental pollutants</b></h3>

<p><span><img alt="Understanding the impact of environmental pollutants" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/69_5c20fabe-f954-4fe2-b318-0308a9da10bf_480x480.png?v=1702632959"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Environmental pollutants can have a significant impact on hair and scalp health due to exposure to various harmful substances found in the air, water, and surroundings. Here's a rundown of the effects of environmental pollutants on hair:</span></p>
<p><b>Air Pollution</b>:</p>
<ol></ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Particulate Matter (PM)</b><span>: Fine particles from vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, and smoke can settle on the scalp and hair, causing dryness, irritation, and potential cuticle damage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Chemical Compounds</b><span>: Harmful chemicals in the air, such as sulphates, nitrogen dioxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), can strip natural oils from the hair, resulting in dryness, frizziness, and increased breakage vulnerability.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Water Quality<span>:</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Chlorine and Hard Water</b><span>: Both chlorine in tap water and minerals in hard water can cause scalp irritation, and dryness, and strip the hair of its natural oils, leaving it dry, brittle, and prone to breakage.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>UV Radiation<span>:</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Sun Exposure</b><span>: Prolonged exposure to UV radiation can damage the hair cuticle, resulting in dryness, discoloration, and weakened hair structure. UV rays can also degrade proteins in the hair, making it brittle.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Climate Factors<span>:</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Humidity</b><span>: High humidity levels can cause frizz and excessive moisture absorption by the hair, whereas low humidity levels can cause dryness and brittleness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Extreme Temperatures</b><span>: Cold weather can cause dry scalp and hair, whereas heat can cause dehydration and potential hair shaft damage.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Impact on Hair Health</b><span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Dryness and Brittleness</b><span>: Environmental pollutants can strip natural oils from the scalp and hair, resulting in dry, brittle hair that is more prone to breakage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Scalp Irritation</b><span>: Pollutants can cause scalp irritation, itchiness, redness, and conditions like <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/dandruff">dandruff</a> or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/eczema">eczema</a>.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hair Loss</b><span>: Prolonged exposure to pollutants may contribute to hair thinning or exacerbate existing hair loss conditions by increasing oxidative stress and inflammation in the scalp.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Protecting Hair from Environmental Damage</b><span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Regular Cleaning</b><span>: Use gentle shampoos to cleanse the hair and scalp to remove pollutants, dirt, and buildup.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydration and conditioning</b><span>: Restore moisture and nourish the hair with conditioners and hydrating masks to prevent dryness and damage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Protective measures</b><span>: When exposed to sunlight for prolonged periods, wear hats or use UV-protecting hair products.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Filtered Water</b><span>: To reduce the effects of hard minerals and chlorine, think about washing your hair with filtered or soft water.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Antioxidant Products</b><span>: To counteract oxidative stress brought on by pollutants, think about utilising antioxidant-containing hair care products.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reducing Exposure</b><span>: To lessen direct contact with pollutants, wear protective hairstyles or limit your exposure to polluted environments.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Protective measures against pollution-induced skin damage</b></h3>

<h2><b>How to reverse skin ageing due to pollution</b></h2>
<div><img alt="How to reverse skin ageing due to pollution" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Ageing_480x480_2ba2eb28-1d4e-41fa-b69a-20f040104335_480x480.webp?v=1702633321"/></div>
<p><span>Reversing the skin damage caused by pollution can be difficult, but there are several steps you can take to help improve the health of your skin.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Apply sunscreen every day</b><span>: Sunscreen is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself from pollution-related skin damage. Make sure to use a broad-spectrum </span>sunscreen<b> </b><span>with SPF 30 or higher, and apply it liberally when going outside for an extended period (1 teaspoon per arm and leg). A good rule of thumb is that you should reapply your sunscreen every two hours while outdoors, even if it's only cloudy outside.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydrate</b><span>: Drink plenty of water and keep your body hydrated.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Cleanse your skin gently</b><span>: Gentle washing can help to remove pollution, makeup, and other substances without irritating the skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Wear a mask when going out in polluted areas</b><span>: While this may not seem like an obvious solution to reversing the effects on your skin caused by air pollution, wearing a face mask when exposed to high levels of particulate matter can help reduce some of its negative impact on your complexion in addition to protecting against other types of pollutants (such as heavy metals or pesticides) that might otherwise become absorbed into your bloodstream through inhalation over time.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet: </b><span>Avoid eating unhealthy foods such as processed meats and fried foods often used in fast food establishments around high-traffic areas where large crowds gather regularly because these items tend to not only contain high levels of fat but also sodium, which causes dehydration, which results in dryness, which ultimately causes wrinkles at those points where skin folds together, such as the corners between the brows and eyes, the corners between the nose and upper lip, and sides of mouth near chin area.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Is skin ageing reversible?</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Is skin ageing reversible?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/110_cca5e200-51b8-4dce-9527-21e701c46e82_480x480.png?v=1702634404"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>As you can see, air pollution can be a serious detriment to your skin. If signs of ageing due to pollution bother you, you may want to see a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">dermatologist</a>. At </span>Clinikally<span> you can take </span>online dermatologist consultation<b> </b><span>which can provide personalised treatment plans based on your specific skin concern. There are steps that you can take to help reverse skin ageing and keep your skin looking young and healthy.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>As we age, skin becomes drier and loses collagen and elasticity. This causes wrinkles to form around our eyes, mouth, and cheeks. To prevent this from happening, use a good-quality moisturiser every day before you go to bed. If your skin is already dry or wrinkled, then use an oil-based one instead of a water-based one, as they penetrate deeply into the layers of your skin keeping it hydrated all night long without causing breakouts!</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Protect yourself from pollution with sunscreen! If you're going outside for more than 15 minutes in sunny weather then make sure that you put on sunscreen every time! Sunscreen works by absorbing harmful UV rays that cause sunburns, which can lead to premature ageing as well as cancer, so keep applying it every few hours throughout the day if needed! Don't forget about those hidden parts too, like underneath your arms or neck, so remember to wear something protective when outdoors during the summer months unless otherwise specified by a dermatologist such as SPF 50+.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Anti-pollution skincare routines</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Anti-pollution skincare routines" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/111_f143fb73-af28-4af7-a6e2-72cd6fd847b6_480x480.png?v=1702635695"/></span></p>

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Injectable Treatments</b><span>: Fillers based on <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hyaluronic-skinbooster-serum">hyaluronic acid</a> replenish volume lost due to environmental damage and smooth wrinkles. By relaxing facial muscles, injections of neurotoxin can lessen the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles brought on by environmental stressors and repetitive facial movements.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skincare Infusions</b><span>: High-end serums and masks enhanced with powerful antioxidants, peptides, or growth factors can aid in the restoration of damaged skin and shield it from the damaging effects of pollution.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Personalised Skincare Regimen</b><span>: To address pollution-induced ageing and protect the skin, dermatologists may recommend antioxidants, retinoids, or specialty topical treatments.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Before pursuing any advanced treatments, consult with a board-certified dermatologist or skincare professional to evaluate your skin concerns, medical history, and suitability for these procedures. A personalised approach incorporating multiple treatment modalities and a consistent skincare routine can effectively combat pollution-related skin ageing.</span></p>

<h2><b>Effectively treat wrinkles and fine lines!</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Effectively treat wrinkles and fine lines!" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/114_479564cd-586e-40b1-9f30-a30ad4c26469_480x480.png?v=1702635297"/></div>
<p><span>With all that pollution around, your skin is doing a good job of trying to keep itself protected. However, that can lead to clogged pores and make you look older than you are. To reverse the effects of air pollution on your skin, it's important to use a good moisturiser each day. This will help prevent dryness and flaking in even the most polluted areas.</span></p>
<p><span>Then some specific skincare products can help: sunscreen is always important, but especially if you're in an area with heavy pollution; <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-skin-renewer-retinol-serum">retinol</a> can be used as an anti-ageing product (but also works well against pollutants); peptides work as both antioxidants and anti-pollution agents; vitamin C helps protect against UV damage while also working against pollutants; and finally, cleansers are key in removing dirt from pores so they don't become blocked by oil residue or dust particles.</span></p>
<h3><b>Topical treatments for reducing wrinkles</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Topical treatments for reducing wrinkles" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/115_7df1765e-a610-4001-9ad7-dadb8f47edbd_480x480.png?v=1702636356"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Topical treatments that target fine lines, wrinkles, and signs of ageing are frequently used to reduce wrinkles. Here are some effective topical treatments for wrinkle reduction:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Retinoids (Retinol, Tretinoin)</b><span>:</span><b> Benefits</b><span>: Retinoids improve skin texture, encourage cell turnover, and increase collagen production, which minimises the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. </span><b>Usage</b><span>: To reduce irritation, start with a low concentration and increase frequency gradually as tolerated. Apply at night, as retinoids can increase sensitivity to sunlight.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Vitamin C Serums</b><span>: </span><b>Benefits</b><span>: Vitamin C is an antioxidant that promotes collagen production, brightens the skin, and lessens the look of wrinkles and uneven skin tone. </span><b>Usage</b><span>: For extra defence against environmental damage, apply a vitamin C serum in the morning before using sunscreen.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Peptides: Benefits</b><span>: Peptides are compounds made of amino acids that help produce collagen, which makes wrinkles and fine lines less noticeable. </span><b>Usage</b><span>: For observable improvements in skin texture, look for products that contain peptides and apply them as instructed.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hyaluronic Acid</b><span>:</span><b> Benefits</b><span>: As a humectant that draws and holds moisture, hyaluronic acid plumps the skin and reduces the visibility of wrinkles. </span><b>Usage</b><span>: For better hydration and smoother-looking skin, use hyaluronic acid serums or moisturisers daily.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs)</b><span>:</span><b> Benefits</b><span>: AHAs like glycolic acid or lactic acid exfoliate the skin, diminishing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by promoting cell turnover. </span><b>Usage</b><span>: To prevent over-exfoliation and promote skin renewal, incorporate AHAs into your skincare routine a couple of times per week.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Niacinamide (Vitamin B3)</b><span>:</span><b> Benefits</b><span>: Niacinamide strengthens the skin barrier, minimises the appearance of wrinkles, and improves skin texture. </span><b>Usage</b><span>: To address several ageing indicators and enhance general skin health, use niacinamide-containing products regularly.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Moisturisers and Sunscreens</b><span>:</span><b> Benefits</b><span>: Broad-spectrum sunscreens and hydrating moisturisers shield the skin from UV rays, preserve moisture levels, and stop further damage that exacerbates wrinkles. </span><b>Usage</b><span>: Include sun protection in your skincare routine by applying sunscreen and moisturiser daily to avoid premature ageing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Collagen-Boosting Ingredients</b><span>:</span><b> Benefits</b><span>: Components like growth factors, copper peptides, and specific plant extracts may aid in promoting the production of collagen, hence lessening the visibility of wrinkles. </span><b>Usage</b><span>: For better skin firmness and elasticity, look for products that contain these ingredients and include them in your routine.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Prescription Treatments</b><span>: A dermatologist may recommend stronger retinoids or Retin-A for greater efficacy in treating more severe wrinkles.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>When utilising topical wrinkle treatments, consistency is essential. It is best to patch-test new items, especially if you have sensitive skin or allergies. Furthermore, combining numerous treatments can often produce superior results; nevertheless, it is critical to introduce solutions gradually to avoid irritation. A dermatologist can provide personalised recommendations targeted at your specific skin conditions.</span></p>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<p><b>Cleanliness</b><span>: To avoid transferring bacteria and impurities onto your skin, keep your makeup brushes, pillowcases, and phones clean.</span></p>
</li>

<p><b>Gentle Approach</b><span>: Avoid using harsh products or exfoliating excessively, as these can disrupt the skin barrier, causing irritation or dryness.</span></p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Consult a Dermatologist</b><span>: If you have persistent skin issues or need advice on skincare routines and products, consult a dermatologist for personalised recommendations.</span></p>
