Silk proteins have been dubbed the "elixir of youth" in skincare due to their remarkable skin benefits. This blog explains why silk proteins are considered an important ingredient in skincare formulations.
The Science Behind Silk: Why It's a Skincare Superstar
Silk has earned a reputation as a skincare superstar due to its unique composition and exceptional skin benefits. Here's a closer look at the science behind silk and why it's valued in skincare: amino acids, hydration, sensitivity, temperature regulation, smooth texture,
antioxidant
properties, biocompatibility, and regenerative effects.
Understanding Sericin and Fibroin: Silk's Dynamic Duo
Silk contains two key proteins, sericin and fibroin, each of which contributes unique properties to the versatile material. Let us take a closer look at sericin and fibroin and their roles in silk:
Sericin
:
Sericin is a sticky, gummy protein that coats the outer layer of silk fibres, also known as silk gum. It is produced by the silkworm's silk gland alongside fibroin during the silk-spinning process.
Sericin serves as a protective layer for the delicate fibroin fibres, shielding them from environmental damage and predators as the silkworm develops. It also contributes to the structural integrity of the silk cocoon.
Sericin is water soluble and has adhesive properties, making it useful in a variety of applications, including textiles, cosmetics, and biomedical materials. It has moisturizing and film-forming properties, which help hydrate and protect the skin.
Sericin has been shown to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and wound-healing properties, which make it useful for skincare. It soothes and calms irritated skin, increases
collagen
production, and improves elasticity and firmness.
Fibroin
:
Fibroin is the structural protein that makes up the majority of silk fibres. It is produced by the silkworm's silk gland and consists of long, fibrous chains of amino acids organised in a complex structure.
Fibroin adds strength, resilience, and flexibility to silk fibres, giving them a smooth and lustrous appearance. It forms the core of the silk filament and is responsible for silk's remarkable mechanical properties.
Fibroin is insoluble in water and resistant to heat, chemicals, and ultraviolet radiation. It has high tensile strength, elasticity, and biocompatibility, making it an excellent choice for a variety of applications such as textiles, biomaterials, and medical devices.
Fibroin is valued for its skin-rejuvenating properties, which improve skin hydration, elasticity, and texture. It creates a protective barrier on the skin's surface to prevent moisture loss and environmental damage. Fibroin-based skincare products promote collagen synthesis, reduce wrinkles, and enhance the overall health and appearance of the skin.
From Cocoons to Creams: The Extraction and Benefits of Silk Proteins
Silk protein extraction from cocoons consists of several steps that isolate and purify the beneficial compounds found in silk fibres. Here's a summary of the extraction procedure and the advantages of silk proteins in skincare:
Silk proteins are extracted from silkworm cocoons, which are the larval stage of silk moths. The silkworms use specialised glands in their bodies to produce a single continuous filament of silk fibre, which they then spin into cocoons.
To extract silk proteins, the cocoons are typically boiled in water to soften the sericin, a sticky protein that coats the fibers. This process, known as degumming, aids in the dissolution and separation of sericin from fibroin, the structural protein that forms the bulk of the silk fiber.
Following degumming, the softened cocoons are unwound or reeled to extract the silk filaments. The silk fibers are carefully unravelled from the cocoons and wound onto spools or reels.
Once extracted, the silk filaments are dried and processed to remove any remaining impurities and sericin. This could include washing, bleaching, and refining the silk fibres to create a purified silk protein extract suitable for use in skincare products.
In some cases, silk proteins may be hydrolyzed, which is the process of breaking down larger protein molecules into smaller peptides. This produces silk hydrolysate, which is more easily absorbed by the skin and may provide additional benefits such as improved moisture and antioxidant activity.

Healing and Repair: Silk's Role in Strengthening the Skin Barrier
Silk plays a significant role in strengthening the skin barrier, contributing to its healing and repair processes. Here's how silk aids in fortifying the skin barrier:
Silk proteins have excellent moisture-retaining properties and form a protective film on the skin's surface to help prevent water loss. By maintaining optimal hydration levels, silk supports the skin barrier's function, ensuring it remains intact and effective in retaining moisture.
The skin's natural barrier function is strengthened in part by silk proteins. They help protect the skin from outside aggressors like pollutants, irritants, and pathogens by forming a physical barrier on its surface. By keeping dangerous chemicals from damaging the skin, this barrier promotes the general health of the skin.
Silk proteins have regenerative properties, which help to repair and rejuvenate the skin barrier. They increase cell turnover and promote the synthesis of collagen and elastin fibres, which are critical components of the skin's structure. This repair process helps to restore the skin barrier's integrity, making it more resilient and damage-resistant.
Silk proteins are naturally soothing and anti-inflammatory, which help to calm and comfort the skin. They reduce redness, irritation, and inflammation, which can impair the skin's barrier function. By soothing the skin, silk proteins support its ability to repair and strengthen the barrier.
The skin barrier is constantly exposed to environmental stressors such as UV radiation, pollution, and extreme weather, which can weaken its structure. Silk proteins form a protective barrier on the skin's surface, shielding it from external factors and preventing damage. This protection enables the skin barrier to perform optimally while maintaining its strength and integrity.
Silk proteins are biocompatible with human skin, which means they are well tolerated and readily absorbed. They blend in with the skin's natural lipid barrier, increasing its strength and resilience without causing irritation or allergic reactions. Silk's compatibility makes it an ideal ingredient for strengthening the skin barrier.
