<p>When it comes to skin breakouts, whiteheads are just as aggravating as their counterparts. Surprisingly, most of us never bother researching the cause of whiteheads, despite having spent the majority of our adult lives honing our self-control so that we can, for once, stop popping them. But no longer! It's finally time to put an end to our whitehead problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/unveiling-the-truth-behind-whiteheads-understanding-the-problem">Whiteheads</a> are a type of acne characterized by small, white bumps on the skin. While they are not harmful, they can be unsightly and difficult to treat. Here are some tips from a doctor on how to get rid of whiteheads permanently:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep your skin clean</strong>: One of the main causes of whiteheads is excess oil and dirt on the skin. Make sure to wash your face twice a day with a gentle cleanser. Avoid scrubbing your face too hard or using harsh products that can irritate your skin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use topical treatments</strong>: Topical treatments that contain <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/salicylic-range">salicylic acid</a>, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/is-benzoyl-peroxide-good-for-acne">benzoyl peroxide</a>, or retinoids can be effective in treating whiteheads. These ingredients work by unclogging pores and reducing inflammation. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label and start with a lower concentration to avoid irritation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid picking or squeezing</strong>: While it may be tempting to pop whiteheads, this can actually make them worse and lead to scarring. Instead, leave them alone and let them heal on their own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintain a healthy diet</strong>: Eating a balanced diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins can help improve the overall health of your skin. Avoid foods that are high in sugar and processed foods, as these can worsen <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-the-ultimate-nia-10-niacinamide-serum">acne</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manage stress</strong>: Stress can cause hormonal changes that can lead to acne. Practicing stress-reducing techniques such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing can help improve the health of your skin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider professional treatments</strong>: If topical treatments and lifestyle changes do not work, consider seeing a dermatologist. They can offer a variety of treatments such as chemical peels, laser therapy, or extractions that can help get rid of whiteheads permanently.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, getting rid of whiteheads permanently may take time and patience. It's important to be consistent with your skincare routine and make lifestyle changes to support healthy skin.</p>
<h2><strong>What causes Whiteheads</strong></h2>
<div><img alt="What causes Whiteheads" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/270_480x480.png?v=1700569117"/></div>
<p>Whiteheads, also known as closed comedones, are a type of acne that forms when dead skin cells, oil, and bacteria accumulate in hair follicles on the skin. More specifically, they occur when the sebaceous glands in the skin produce too much sebum, which mixes with dead skin cells and becomes trapped in the hair follicle, leading to the formation of a white or flesh-coloured bump.</p>
<p>Various factors can contribute to the development of whiteheads, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hormonal changes</strong>: Hormonal fluctuations during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause can increase sebum production and trigger the development of whiteheads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Genetics</strong>: People with a family history of acne are more likely to develop whiteheads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skincare products</strong>: Certain skincare products, such as heavy creams or lotions, can <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/open-pores">clog pores</a> and contribute to the formation of whiteheads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diet</strong>: Some studies suggest that a diet high in sugar and dairy products may increase the risk of developing acne, including whiteheads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Environmental factors</strong>: Exposure to pollutants, humidity, and other environmental factors can also contribute to the development of whiteheads.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, the causes of whiteheads are complex and can vary from person to person. Effective treatment typically involves a combination of skincare, lifestyle changes, and, in some cases, medication.</p>
