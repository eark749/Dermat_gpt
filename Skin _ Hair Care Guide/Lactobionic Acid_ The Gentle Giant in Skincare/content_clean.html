<div><img alt="Lactobionic Acid vs. Other Acids: A Comparative Insight" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_4_-_2024-07-10T134143.504_480x480.jpg?v=1720599117"/></div>
<p><span>Lactobionic Acid (LBA) differs significantly from other acids typically used in skincare in terms of qualities, advantages, and compatibility for different skin types. Here's a comparison of LBA with other acids such as glycolic acid (AHA) and gluconolactone (PHA):</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Lactobionic Acid (LBA)</b><span>: The kind is Polyhydroxy Acid (PHA). The molecular size is larger than that of other AHAs such as glycolic acid. Exfoliation is mild exfoliation that aids in the removal of dead skin cells without creating major irritation. Its gentle exfoliating action makes it suited for sensitive skin. Hydrating is hygroscopic, which draws moisture and improves skin hydration. Antioxidants neutralise free radicals, protecting against environmental harm. Anti-inflammatory properties relax and soothe inflamed skin. Barrier Support enhances the skin's barrier function.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Glycolic Acid (AHA)</b><span>: The kind is Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA). Molecular size is smaller than PHAs. Exfoliation is beneficial because it penetrates deep into the skin and removes dead cells. Effective allows for rapid skin rejuvenation and texture improvement. Stimulates Collagen production increases skin firmness while decreasing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Brightening helps to reduce <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">hyperpigmentation</a> and even out skin tone. <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-nia-serum">Acne</a> Treatment can help treat acne because of its exfoliating and pore-clearing qualities.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Gluconolactone (PHA)</b><span>: The kind is Polyhydroxy Acid (PHA), which is comparable to LBA. Molecular size is larger than AHAs. Exfoliation gives a gentle exfoliation similar to LBA, making it appropriate for delicate skin. Moisturising attracts moisture to the skin, which improves hydration. Antioxidants have antioxidant properties that protect the skin from environmental harm. Its gentle nature makes it excellent for those who are sensitive to harsher acids.</span></p>

<div><img alt="Gentle Exfoliation: How Lactobionic Acid Smoothens Skin" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_4_-_2024-07-10T133755.742_480x480.jpg?v=1720598898"/></div>
<p><span>Lactobionic acid (LBA) is well-known for its gentle exfoliating characteristics, making it a top choice for people looking for smoother, more radiant skin without the discomfort that comes with other exfoliants. Here's how LBA helps to smooth the skin:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Polyhydroxy Acid (PHA) Properties</b><span>: LBA is a polyhydroxy acid (PHA), which implies it has a bigger molecular structure than alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs). This size is useful since it exfoliates without going too deeply, lowering the risk of irritation. The mild nature of PHAs such as LBA ensures that the skin's surface is exfoliated gently, eliminating dead skin cells while not damaging the skin barrier.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Mild Exfoliation Mechanism</b><span>: LBA primarily works on the skin's surface, breaking the connections that hold dead skin cells together. This procedure helps to expose younger, smoother skin underneath. Unlike more potent acids, LBA does not induce redness, dryness, or irritation. This makes it suited for any skin type, even sensitive and reactive skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydrating Exfoliation</b><span>: LBA's hygroscopic characteristics exfoliate while also attracting and retaining moisture. This dual action keeps the skin moisturised and supple even after dead skin cells are gone. LBA improves skin texture by encouraging improved moisture retention and moderate exfoliation, resulting in a smoother, more even tone.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Supporting the Skin Barrier</b><span>: LBA helps to strengthen the skin's natural barrier. A robust skin barrier is essential for limiting moisture loss and protecting against external irritants, ultimately improving the skin's general health and resilience. By preserving the skin barrier, LBA reduces the risk of irritation and inflammation, resulting in a relaxing exfoliating experience.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory Benefits</b><span>: LBA has antioxidant properties, which protect the skin from oxidative stress and free radical damage. This protection preserves youthful skin by preventing premature ageing. LBA's anti-inflammatory effects soothe irritated skin, reducing redness and inflammation, making it especially useful for persons with sensitive skin or disorders such as rosacea.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Versatility in Skincare Formulations</b><span>: LBA works well with other skincare components, increasing the efficacy of serums, creams, and masks. It can be mixed with other moisturising, antioxidant, and calming components to produce more complete skincare solutions. Whether used as a daily moisturiser, a weekly mask, or a focused serum, LBA's gentle exfoliating action makes it an adaptable addition to any skincare regimen.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h5><b>Antioxidant Power: Protecting Your Skin from Environmental Stress</b></h5>
<h4><span>Lactobionic acid's antioxidant activity protects the skin from environmental stresses, oxidative damage, and premature ageing. LBA contributes to skin health by neutralising free radicals, preserving collagen and elastin fibres, promoting a luminous complexion, and supporting general skin resilience. Whether used as a prophylactic or as part of an anti-aging regimen, LBA provides efficient antioxidant protection that leads to healthier, more youthful-looking skin over time.</span></h4>
