Consider incorporating the wellness and nutrition strategies outlined in this blog into your summer routine for vibrant health and energy.
Staying Hydrated: The Foundation of Summer Heal
Staying hydrated is truly the foundation of summer health. Drink plenty of water, eat hydrating foods, monitor urine colour, set reminders, carry a reusable water bottle, avoid dehydrating beverages, hydrate before, during, and after exercise, and listen to your body. Prioritizing hydration and incorporating these strategies into your daily routine can help you stay properly hydrated while also supporting your overall health and well-being during the summer.
Effective Hydration Strategies Beyond Water Intake
Effective hydration strategies go beyond just drinking water and can include hydrating foods, electrolyte-rich beverages, and mindful hydration practices. Here are some strategies to improve hydration beyond water intake:
Incorporate Hydrating Foods
: To supplement your fluid intake, consume fruits and vegetables high in water content.  Watermelon, cucumbers, oranges, strawberries, lettuce, and celery are all great choices. These foods contain not only water, but also essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
Coconut Water
: Rich in electrolytes like potassium, sodium, and magnesium by nature, coconut water is a great way to stay hydrated.  It can be a cool substitute for water, particularly in the heat or after physical activity when electrolyte loss is increased.
Herbal Teas
: In addition to providing several health advantages, herbal teas like hibiscus, chamomile, and peppermint can help with hydration.  Herbal teas are caffeine-free and can be sipped hot or cold, in contrast to caffeinated teas.
Water-Rich Smoothies
: Use fruits high in water content, such as citrus fruits, melons, and berries, to make smoothies.  Leafy greens like kale or spinach can also be added; they provide extra hydration as well as vitamins and minerals.
Broth-Based Soups
: Indulging in broth-based soups, like chicken or vegetable broth, can supply nutrients and electrolytes while also keeping you hydrated.  To keep salt intake under control, choose homemade or low-sodium varieties.
Electrolyte Supplements
: Use electrolyte supplements or powders to replace electrolytes lost through sweating, particularly after strenuous exercise or extended outdoor activities.  Look for products containing sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium.
Hydrating Snacks
: Choose hydrating snacks such as yoghurt, cottage cheese, fresh fruit, or raw vegetables and hummus.  These snacks not only help with fluid intake, but they also provide essential nutrients that promote overall health.
Mindful Hydration Practices
: Drink fluids slowly throughout the day rather than in large amounts all at once.  This allows your body to absorb and use fluids more efficiently. Additionally, pay attention to your body's thirst cues and drink when you feel thirsty.
Recognizing and Preventing Dehydration
Recognizing and preventing dehydration is critical for overall health and well-being, particularly in hot weather or during periods of increased physical activity. Here are some key signs of dehydration and how to prevent it:
Signs of Dehydration
:
Thirst is one of the first indications of dehydration.  If you are thirsty, you should drink fluids to replenish lost water.
Dark urine is yellow or amber and indicates dehydration.  In contrast, light-colored urine indicates adequate hydration.
Dry mouth and lips may indicate dehydration.  Dehydration reduces saliva production, resulting in mouth dryness.
Dehydration can cause feelings of exhaustion, weakness, and lethargy.  When the body lacks adequate fluids, it may struggle to carry out daily tasks efficiently.
Headaches and migraines can be caused by dehydration.  Proper hydration improves blood flow to the brain, lowering the risk of headaches.
Dehydration can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting, particularly when standing up suddenly.  This is due to a decrease in blood volume and pressure.
Inadequate hydration can make the skin dry, tight, and less elastic.  Severe dehydration can cause sunken
eyes
and decreased skin turgor.
Dehydration-induced electrolyte imbalances can cause muscle cramps, particularly during exercise or physical exertion.
Prevention Strategies
:
Stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day, even if you are not thirsty.  Aim for at least 8 glasses (64 ounces) of water per day, or more if you are sweating profusely from heat or exercise.
Keep an eye on the color of your urine to determine your hydration level.  Pale yellow or clear urine indicates good hydration, whereas dark yellow urine indicates dehydration.
Drink fluids before, during, and after exercise to replenish the fluids lost through sweating.  Water, sports drinks, or electrolyte-rich beverages can help replace lost fluids and electrolytes.
Include fruits and vegetables with high water content in your diet, such as watermelon, cucumbers, oranges, and strawberries.  These foods help with overall hydration and provide necessary vitamins and minerals.
Limit your intake of caffeinated and alcoholic beverages, as they can have diuretic effects and cause fluid loss.  If you do consume these beverages, make sure to balance them with plenty of water.
Select lightweight, breathable fabrics that allow sweat to evaporate and effectively cool the body, particularly in hot weather or during physical activity..
If you are spending time outside in hot weather, take frequent breaks in the shade to rest, cool down, and drink.  Avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight, particularly during peak hours.
Consider using electrolyte supplements or powders to replace electrolytes lost through sweating, particularly during intense exercise or prolonged outdoor activities.
Hydrating Foods to Incorporate Into Your Diet
Incorporating hydrating foods into your diet is an excellent way to stay hydrated, especially in hot weather or during intense physical activity. Here are some hydrating foods to incorporate into your meals and snacks:
Cucumbers contain over 95% water, making them one of the most hydrating foods available.  Sliced cucumbers are great in salads, sandwiches, and as a refreshing snack with hummus.
Watermelon is high in water, electrolytes, and vitamins, making it not only delicious but also nutritious.  Chunks of watermelon can be enjoyed on their own, blended into smoothies, or added to fruit salads for a hydrating treat.
Berries, such as strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries, are high in water and contain antioxidants and vitamins.  Mix them into yoghurt, muesli, or salads for a hydrating and nutritious boost.
Citrus fruits, including oranges, grapefruits, and lemons, are hydrating and high in
vitamin C
.  Enjoy them as a snack, add them to water for flavor, or use the juice in salad dressings and marinades.
Leafy greens like lettuce, spinach, kale, and Swiss chard contain a lot of water and are high in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.  They can be eaten in salads, wraps, and sandwiches, or blended into smoothies.
Tomatoes contain approximately 95% water and are high in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.  Sliced tomatoes are great on sandwiches, salads, and as a base for sauces and salsas.
Celery is crunchy, hydrating, and low in calories, making it an excellent snack choice.  Enjoy celery sticks with peanut butter, hummus, or cream cheese for a hydrating and satisfying snack.
Bell peppers are hydrating and contain vitamins A and C.  Sliced bell peppers are great with dip, added to stir-fries and salads, or stuffed with quinoa or rice for a nutritious meal.
Coconut water is a natural source of electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, and magnesium, making it an ideal hydrating beverage.  It can be enjoyed on its own or as a base for smoothies and mocktails.
Cantaloupe is a delicious, juicy, and hydrating summer fruit.  Chunks of cantaloupe can be eaten on their own, blended into smoothies, or added to fruit salads for a refreshing treat.
Sun Protection: Shielding Your Skin and Beyond
Sun protection is essential for keeping your skin healthy and preventing sun damage. Here are some sun safety strategies to protect your skin and overall well-being:
Use Sunscreen
: Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all exposed skin, including your face, neck, ears, and hands.  Reapply
sunscreen
every two hours, or more often if swimming or sweating.
Seek Shade
: Limit direct sun exposure during peak hours, which are typically between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.  Seek shade from trees, umbrellas, or awnings, especially when the sun's rays are the strongest.
Wear Protective Clothing
: Protect yourself from the sun's harmful UV rays by dressing in lightweight, tightly woven clothing.  Wear long-sleeved shirts, pants, wide-brimmed hats and UV-protective sunglasses.
Avoid Tanning Beds
: Tanning beds and sunlamps emit harmful UV radiation, which can damage the skin and increase the risk of skin cancer.
Stay Hydrated
: Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, especially when you are spending time outside in the sun.  Dehydration can worsen the effects of sun exposure and raise the risk of heat-related illnesses.
Protect Your Eyes
: Wear UV-protective sunglasses to shield your eyes from harmful UV rays.  Look for sunglasses that completely block UVA and UVB rays to protect your eyes and the delicate skin surrounding them.
Check UV Index
: Check the UV index before heading outdoors to gauge the intensity of UV radiation. Plan outdoor activities accordingly, and take extra precautions when UV levels are high.
Apply SPF Lip Balm
: To protect your lips from sunburn and damage, use an SPF lip balm.  Look for lip balms with SPF 30 or higher, and reapply frequently, especially when spending time outside.
Perform Regular Skin Checks
: Check your skin regularly to look for changes in moles, freckles, and other skin lesions.  If you notice any suspicious changes, such as new or changing moles,
consult a dermatologist
to rule out skin cancer.
Protect Children and Pets
: Take extra precautions to shield children and pets from the sun's damaging rays.  Dress them in protective clothing, apply sunscreen regularly, and provide plenty of shade and water when they are outside.
By following these sun protection strategies, you can protect your skin from sun damage, lower your risk of skin cancer, and enjoy safe and healthy outdoor activities all year long. Remember that sun protection is more than just protecting your skin; it is also about protecting your overall health and well-being.
Choosing and Applying the Right Sunscreen
Choosing and applying the proper sunscreen is critical for effective sun protection. Here's a guide to help you choose and apply sunscreen effectively:
Choosing Sunscreen
:
Select a sunscreen labelled "broad-spectrum," which protects against both UVA and UVB radiation.  UVA rays can prematurely age the skin, while UVB rays cause sunburn and contribute to skin cancer.
Select a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. SPF indicates how long the sunscreen protects your skin from UVB rays compared to not wearing sunscreen. SPF 30 filters out about 97% of UVB rays, while SPF 50 filters out about 98%.
If you'll be swimming or sweating, opt for a water-resistant sunscreen. Water-resistant sunscreens protect for up to 40 or 80 minutes of water exposure, as indicated on the label.
Consider your skin type and sensitivities when choosing sunscreen. If you have sensitive skin or allergies, look for fragrance-free, hypoallergenic formulas. If you have oily skin, choose oil-free or non-comedogenic sunscreens.
If you'll be engaging in outdoor activities or spending extended periods in the sun, consider specialized sunscreens designed for sports, babies, or sensitive areas like the face and lips.
Applying Sunscreen
:
Use enough sunscreen to cover all exposed skin thoroughly. Most adults need about one ounce (equivalent to a shot glass) of sunscreen to cover the entire body. Don't forget often-overlooked areas like the ears, neck, scalp (if hair is thinning or parted), and tops of feet.
Apply sunscreen at least 15 minutes before going outside to allow it to absorb into the skin and provide maximum protection. Reapply sunscreen every two hours, or more frequently if swimming or sweating.
To protect your lips from sunburn and damage, use an SPF-containing lip balm. Look for lip balms with SPF 30 or higher, and reapply frequently, especially when spending time outside.
Reapply sunscreen frequently, especially after swimming, sweating, or towel drying. Even water-resistant sunscreens can wear off over time, so reapply as directed to ensure protection.
Sunscreen should be incorporated into your daily skincare routine, even on cloudy or overcast days. UV rays can penetrate clouds and cause skin damage, so wearing sunscreen every day keeps your skin protected all year.
Natural Remedies for Soothing Sunburn
Natural remedies can help relieve sunburn and promote healing. Here are some effective alternatives:
Aloe Vera
: One of the most widely used home cures for sunburn is aloe vera gel.  Apply pure aloe vera gel to the affected area to relieve inflammation, reduce redness, and promote healing. Keep the gel refrigerated for added cooling power.
Cool compresses
: To help with pain and inflammation relief, apply cool compresses to the sunburned area.  Before applying to the affected area, make a pot of chamomile tea and put it in the fridge, or soak a clean cloth in cold water.
Oatmeal Bath
: Taking an oatmeal bath can ease the itching and discomfort associated with sunburns.  Fill a bathtub halfway full with lukewarm water, add colloidal oatmeal or finely ground oats, and let soak for fifteen to twenty minutes. After, pat dry your skin gently; do not rub.
Cold Milk
: For a few minutes, apply a cloth soaked in cold milk to the sunburned area.  The proteins in milk can calm and lessen skin irritation. As an alternative, you can use a spray bottle to combine equal parts water and milk, then spritz the affected area.
Coconut Oil
: Coconut oil can help relieve sunburned skin because of its hydrating and anti-inflammatory qualities.  Directly apply virgin coconut oil to the injured area to hydrate and aid in healing. Be cautious if you're prone to
acne
, as coconut oil can clog pores for some people.
Green Tea
: Green tea has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant qualities that help relieve sunburned skin.  Make some green tea, allow it to cool, and use a cotton ball or spray bottle to apply it to the afflicted area. Alternatively, you can use a cloth that has been soaked in chilled green tea as a compress.
Apple cider vinegar
: Use a cotton ball or spray bottle to apply diluted apple cider vinegar, diluted with water, to sunburned skin.  Apple cider vinegar's acetic acid has analgesic and analgesic properties. To prevent irritation, make sure to dilute it appropriately.
Hyaluronic Acid Serum
: The skin naturally contains
hyaluronic acid
, which aids in moisture retention.  Sunburned skin can benefit from moisturizing and soothed using a hyaluronic acid serum. For optimum effects, look for a serum that contains few additional ingredients.
Keep Yourself Hydrated
: To keep your body hydrated from the inside out, drink lots of water.  The body can become dehydrated from sunburn, so it is critical to regularly drink water to replace lost fluids.
Prevent Additional Sun Exposure
: Retain sunburned skin by staying inside or wearing hats, sunglasses, and clothing to protect it from the sun.  Sunburned skin that has been exposed to UV radiation may get worse and take longer to heal.
Protective Clothing and Accessories for Sun Safety
Protective clothing and accessories are essential for staying safe in the sun and lowering your risk of sunburn,
premature ageing
, and skin cancer. Here are some items to consider for sun protection:
Choose hats with wide brims that will provide shade for your face, neck, and ears. For additional sun protection, choose hats made of tightly woven fabric with a UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) rating.
Sunglasses with UV protection will protect your eyes from harmful UV rays. Choose sunglasses that block 100% of UVA and UVB rays to protect your eyes and the delicate skin surrounding them.
Look for clothing with UPF ratings, which indicate the garment's ability to block ultraviolet radiation. UPF clothing provides better sun protection than regular clothing because it blocks both UVA and UVB rays.
Wear lightweight, long-sleeved shirts and trousers made of tightly woven fabrics for extra sun protection. Dark-colored clothing may offer better protection than light-colored clothing.
If you plan to swim or participate in water activities, consider wearing rash guards or swim shirts with UPF protection. These shirts provide sun protection while keeping you cool and comfortable in the water.
Use UV-protective umbrellas or parasols to provide shade and shield yourself from direct sunlight, especially at outdoor events or picnics.
Sun hats with neck flaps or capes offer extra protection for the neck and upper back, which are prone to sunburn and skin damage.
If you will be spending a lot of time in the sun, consider wearing UV-protective gloves to keep your hands safe from UV radiation. To ensure maximum comfort, choose gloves composed of breathable, light materials.
Sun sleeves are stretchy, lightweight sleeves that can be used to shield the arms from the sun. They can be especially helpful for outdoor activities like cycling, hiking, and gardening because they are simple to put on and take off.
Invest in swimwear with built-in UPF protection for extra sun protection while swimming or lounging by the pool or beach.
