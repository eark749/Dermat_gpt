In this blog, we will look at 8 great home remedies for dandruff.
Understanding Dandruff: Causes and Symptoms
Dandruff
is often associated with
seborrheic dermatitis
(SD), which produces itchy and dry skin on the scalp. It is so widespread that it affects around half of the world's adult population. Dandruff can be caused by a variety of circumstances, making it difficult to determine the actual cause of your itchy, flaky scalp. Here are several possible culprits:
The oils that your sebaceous glands produce.
Fungal colonization on the surface of your skin.
Malassezia is a yeast that can irritate the scalp and cause excessive skin cell growth.
Insufficient shampooing may cause skin cells to accumulate and create flakes and itching.
Shampooing too frequently can cause overdrying of the scalp.
Brushing your hair too much or too forcefully can cause friction with the
sensitive skin
on your scalp.
A reaction to personal care products, or
contact dermatitis
, that causes your scalp to irritate and itchy.
Sun damage
Hats exert excessive pressure on the scalp.
A diet that is deficient in certain nutrients
Being exposed to dirt or dust.
Some people may be more susceptible to dandruff than others for unexplained reasons. For example, guys are more likely to have dandruff than females. You may have noticed symptoms throughout puberty, but dandruff can appear at any age. People with oilier hair or who suffer from certain illnesses (such as Parkinson's disease, HIV, or other immune-system-altering medicines) are also at a higher risk.
What Causes Dandruff?
Dandruff can be caused by a variety of factors, including irritated or greasy skin,
dry skin
. Malassezia is a yeast-like fungus that lives on most adults' scalps and feeds off of oils.
Common Symptoms of Dandruff
The primary symptoms of dandruff are skin flakes and an itchy, scaly,
oily scalp
. Oily flakes tend to gather in your hair and shoulders, and they generally worsen in the fall and winter when the air is dry. Symptoms may be more severe in certain people. Dandruff symptoms may include:
oily flakes
Itching
Irritated patches on the skin of the scalp and sometimes on the face
Eyebrow dandruff
Hair loss
Dry flakes on the skin of the face
Top Home Remedies for Dandruff
Some people recommend that you try natural home remedies for dandruff before turning to medicated solutions.
Baking soda
: Apply baking soda to your scalp in the shower and rinse after a few minutes.
Apple cider vinegar
: Combine 1/4 cup vinegar with 1/4 cup water. Apply it to your hair for 15 minutes to an hour, then rinse. Do this twice a week.
Coconut oil
: Apply 3 to 5 teaspoons of coconut oil to your scalp and leave for an hour. Then
shampoo
your hair and rinse it thoroughly.

Natural ingredients may cause skin reactions in certain people. It is best to apply a new product to a small area and leave it there for at least 24 hours before moving on to a larger area.
Using Apple Cider Vinegar
Washing your scalp with a solution of diluted apple cider vinegar may help reduce dandruff.
Mix 1-3 tablespoons (tbsp) of apple cider vinegar with warm water.
After shampooing, apply the apple cider vinegar wash to your head.
Massage the mixture into the scalp with your fingertips.
Allow the mixture to sit for a few minutes before rinsing thoroughly.
Apple cider vinegar has a strong odor that some people may find unpleasant. Adding a few drops of essential oil to the scalp treatment may help to mask the smell.
Benefits of Tea Tree Oil
Tea tree oil can effectively combat the fungus responsible for dandruff, reducing flakes and itching.
The oil works well as a natural lice treatment due to its insecticidal qualities.
Tea tree oil can indirectly encourage
hair growth
by preserving a healthy scalp environment and lowering dandruff.
Aloe Vera for Scalp Health
Calms an itchy scalp
:
The clinical term for the disorder commonly known as dandruff is seborrheic dermatitis. Aloe vera might help with itchy scalps and flaky skin under your hair.
Deep cleans oily hair
:
Aloe vera effectively washes the hair shaft, removing excess sebum (oil) and residue from previous hair products. However, aloe vera does not damage your hair strands while cleaning. Unlike other chemicals found in hair products, aloe vera is mild and protects the integrity of your hair. Using aloe vera is an excellent technique to make your hair look healthier, shinier, and softer.
Strengthens and repairs hair strands
:
Aloe vera contains the
vitamin C
, A and E. All three of these vitamins help with cell turnover, encouraging healthy cell growth and lustrous hair. Aloe vera gel also contains vitamins B12 and folic acid. Both of these ingredients can help keep your hair from falling out. However, no research has demonstrated that aloe vera has any advantage in reducing hair loss.
Promote hair growth
:
You might observe that hair breakage and loss decrease after washing your scalp and applying aloe vera treatment. Many people claim that aloe vera causes hair to grow faster. However, there is currently little clinical evidence to support or refute these assertions.
Coconut Oil and Lemon Juice
Lemon and coconut oil can help treat dandruff. Lemon juice contains acidic characteristics that can help eliminate excess oil and dead skin cells from the scalp, whilst coconut oil moisturizes the scalp and fights fungal infections. They can work together to balance the pH of the scalp and support overall scalp health.
Baking Soda Treatment
Baking soda can be used in moderation to clean the scalp and hair, exfoliate the scalp, and reduce the use of semi-permanent hair dye. It will not affect the rate of hair development, which is important to note given the number of misconceptions about the benefits of baking soda for hair.
Yogurt and Honey Mask
In addition to honey, this mask contains yogurt and coconut oil. Yogurt has protein, which can wash and strengthen your hair. Coconut oil may nourish and soften your hair. You will need the following ingredients: 1/2 cup plain, full-fat yogurt, 3-4 tablespoons honey, and 2 tablespoons coconut oil.  Mix the honey and coconut oil, then microwave for 15 seconds. Once cooled, add the yogurt and continue to stir until thoroughly combined.
Neem Leaves Solution
This is one of Neem's most well-known advantages. It aids in the treatment of all types of dandruff, as well as the relief of red and itchy scalps caused by persistent dandruff. Dandruff is produced by a fungus known as Malassezia, and Neem's powerful antifungal and antibacterial characteristics play an important role in eradicating this dandruff-causing bug and removing dandruff. As soon as this occurs, the redness, soreness, itching, and visible flakes gradually subside because there is no more dead cell build-up to reveal dandruff. All you have to do is use an effective anti-dandruff shampoo with neem as the main ingredient and gently massage it into your scalp 2-3 times per week. This will ensure that the dandruff is completely removed from your scalp and does not return.
Olive Oil Massage
Let us look at how using olive oil for hair growth can work wonders:
Helps condition and nourish
: Olive oil is a great
moisturizer
for the scalp. It contains every vitamin needed to nourish and condition your hair properly. This
hair oil
contains squalene and oleic acid, which help prevent split ends and improve hair flexibility. You can apply this hair oil to the ends of your strands if they are dry or
frizzy
, but avoid the scalp.
It calms and nourishes the scalp
: A stress-free and healthy environment is necessary for survival. As a result, it is critical to preserve all of the oil's benefits while also encouraging increased growth. Furthermore, this would improve the oil's ability to hydrate the hair follicles and roots by reaching the scalp's cellular layers. Thus, the oil keeps the scalp hydrated, creating favorable conditions for healthy hair growth and nutrition for the hair strands. Olive oil is antimicrobial and antifungal, and it calms and soothes your scalp. Furthermore, its moisturizing properties alleviate dryness, dandruff, and clogged follicles, minimizing irritation. Dandruff and blocked follicles are the leading causes of hair loss. It is preferable to address these concerns to avoid hair loss.
Reduces the production of DHT
: The increased production of dihydrotestosterone, a naturally occurring hormone in the human body, is a significant contributor to hair loss. It harms the hair and weakens the strands. Olive oil inhibits the manufacturing of this hormone, reducing hair loss and promoting healthier hair growth.
Protects against damage
: Olive oil is high in minerals and
antioxidants
. They protect the hair from injury and prevent hair thinning. This oil can repair the damage produced by free radicals and environmental stresses. As a result, it promotes hair development and prevents hair loss by repairing damage caused by external aggressors.
Minimizes hair breakage
: Another benefit of olive oil is that it reduces frequent and excessive breaks, preserving hair volume and thickness. It strengthens and conditions the hair and scalp, hence improving the texture and complexion. Additionally, it contains omega-6 fatty acids, which help reduce seasonal dryness and breaking.
Prevents Premature Graying of Hair
: Our lifestyle patterns are inappropriate since they cause unnecessary injury to our bodies. Poor dietary habits, insufficient sleep, excessive stress, and exposure to pollutants all have an impact on hair quality. The unhealthy way of life causes premature graying of the hair and damage. Your choice of hair oil is always significant, as it moisturizes your scalp and revitalizes the roots and follicles. Furthermore, if you followed this road of oiling your hair regularly using the best olive oil for hair, you would prevent common issues such as dandruff, flaking, split ends, dryness, and premature graying.

Proper Hair Washing Techniques
Now that we've covered what not to do, try this stylist-approved, step-by-step tutorial for washing and conditioning your hair.
Soak your hair in warm water before shampooing.
Start washing your hair at the roots.
Scrub your scalp, not your hair.
Wash your hands and repeat as needed.
Rinse your shampoo thoroughly.
Apply
conditioner
to the bottom half of the hair.
Rinse the conditioner with a cold solution.
Choosing the Right Shampoo
Observe how your hair reacts over time after applying a new shampoo. If the shampoo increases texture, volume, gloss, or manageability, it is most likely appropriate for your hair. If any of these symptoms worsen, or if the shampoo causes irritation or itching on your scalp, it may not be appropriate for your hair.
Diet and Hydration Tips
Eating correctly is usually beneficial because it boosts your overall immunity and improves your health. However, if you're looking for
dry scalp
cures, you might consider making some dietary modifications.
Vitamin B
: This is an entire category of vitamins that are becoming increasingly vital in your diet. Vitamin B3 (Niacin) is believed to improve blood circulation and reduce cholesterol levels. This increased blood circulation, as well as the potential capillary enlargement caused by niacin supplementation, can increase hair strand thickness and skin
hydration
levels. This is why individuals utilize vitamin B-rich foods for dry hair, such as fish, poultry, brown rice, lentils, and fortified cereals. It can help prevent dryness and
aging
of the skin, improving general health.
Reduce sugar
:
This will surely be bad news for those who enjoy sweets. If you want to get rid of your scalp problems, you should cut back on sugar, particularly processed sugar. Sugar has a high glycemic index, which can cause insulin levels to increase. This has a significant impact on your sebum production because it also affects your hormone levels. If you crave something sweet, try coconut sugar, but only in moderation.
Fatty acids
:
If you're seeking nourishment for dry hair and scalp, look for omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acid-rich components. This can help manage your skin's sebum production while also increasing moisture levels. It also helps with inflammation. You can supplement with these foods or eat fish, soybeans, eggs, spinach, almonds, or seeds.
Zinc
:
It is important to consume adequate zinc when attempting to regulate the quantity of moisture on your head. Zinc regulates sebum secretion on the scalp, reducing dryness. However, keep in mind that using too much will cause your scalp to dry out even more. Add biotin, another B vitamin that aids in zinc absorption. Use components such as beans, whole grains, dairy products, almonds, and pumpkin.
Vitamin A
:
This vitamin is classified into two classes: retinoids and carotenoids, both of which are beneficial to the skin. Vitamin A has been demonstrated to influence pore behavior and control skin health; it is commonly used to treat
acne
and as a powerful antioxidant to prevent premature aging. Thus, vitamin A-rich foods such as broccoli, apples, carrots, melon, parsley, peppers, eggs, and whole milk may be beneficial for a dry scalp.
Iron
: This mineral is required for the vital function of carrying oxygen and nutrients throughout the body, particularly to the skin cells. It is essential for improving scalp health and ensuring skin function. However, you should exercise caution because excess iron can cause skin infections and other problems. It is present in red meat, shellfish, beans, spinach, apricots, tofu, and peas.
Reduce alcohol and caffeine
:
Although it is not considered a food for dry hair, it might dehydrate your body and impair zinc absorption in the system. Alcohol and coffee can also raise your insulin levels and affect your oil secretion. To counteract this, stay well hydrated.
Conclusion: Achieving Dandruff-Free Hair with Natural Remedies
