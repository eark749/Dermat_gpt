<h3><strong>Antioxidant for sun protection</strong></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Antioxidants for sun protection" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/52_ca26e9cd-f924-4535-9588-f699262e03aa_480x480.png?v=1698324194"/></span></p>
</div>
<p>While antioxidants can offer some degree of protection against the harmful effects of sun exposure, they should not be relied upon as the sole method of sun protection.</p>
<p>Antioxidants work by neutralizing free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can damage cells and contribute to aging and disease. When skin is exposed to sunlight, free radicals are generated, which can cause damage to the skin's cells and DNA. Antioxidants can help to neutralize these free radicals, reducing the damage they cause.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-sunprotect-sunscreen-spf-50">sunscreen</a> is still the most effective method of protecting your skin from the harmful effects of UV rays. Sunscreen works by creating a physical barrier between your skin and the sun, reflecting or absorbing the UV radiation before it can damage your skin cells.</p>
<p>So while incorporating antioxidant-rich foods and skincare products into your routine can certainly offer some degree of protection against sun damage, it's important to also use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher and to seek shade during peak sun hours to protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays.</p>
<h2><strong>Takeaway: Repair damaged skin with potent antioxidants!</strong></h2>
<div><img alt="Repair damaged skin with potent antioxidants!" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/32_f7084d7a-fb4f-4d09-b1cd-66cbfd85c30c_480x480.png?v=1698324319"/></div>
<p>Potent antioxidants can be very effective in repairing damaged skin. Antioxidants help to protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can damage cells and tissues. Free radicals are generated by factors such as UV radiation, pollution, and smoking. When they accumulate in the skin, they can cause oxidative stress, which can damage the skin's collagen and elastin fibres, leading to wrinkles, fine lines, and other signs of aging.</p>
<p>Potent antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10 can neutralize free radicals and protect the skin from oxidative stress. They can also stimulate collagen production, which can help to restore the skin's elasticity and firmness. Additionally, antioxidants can help to brighten the skin, reduce inflammation, and improve the skin's texture and tone.</p>
<p>To get the most benefit from potent antioxidants, it's important to use skincare products that contain high-quality, stable forms of these ingredients.
