There are many reasons why hair loss in men can occur. In this blog, we will look at some of the common causes and solutions.
Understanding Hair Fall in Men
Male
androgenetic alopecia
is the most common cause of
hair loss
in men. The hair loss is progressive. Terminal hairs are gradually converted into vellus hairs in a highly predictable fashion, which depletes the scalp and causes baldness.
Common Causes of Male Hair Loss
The most prevalent cause of hair loss is a hereditary disorder that develops with age. This disorder is known as androgenic alopecia, male-pattern
baldness
, and female-pattern baldness.
Hormonal changes caused by pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, and thyroid disorders can all result in permanent or temporary hair loss.
Certain medications, including those used to treat cancer, arthritis, depression, heart disease, gout, and high blood pressure, can cause hair loss as a side effect.
Many people notice
hair thinning
for several months following a physical or mental trauma.
Excessive hairstyling or hairstyles that pull your hair tight, such as pigtails or cornrows.
Genetics and Male Pattern Baldness
Male pattern baldness is generally inherited, which males obtain from their mothers. However, it is not defined by a single gene; several genes contribute to the risk. This complicates the inheritance pattern and makes it less predictable.
The androgen receptor gene is the most important genetic component involved. Androgens, including dihydrotestosterone (DHT), play an important role in hair loss. Men with a genetic predisposition to have more androgen receptors in their hair follicles may be more vulnerable to the effects of DHT, resulting in hair thinning and loss.
If you have a family history of baldness, you are more likely to develop it as well. However, male pattern baldness can occur without a strong family history, as genetics can be complex and incorporate several factors.
Hormonal Changes
Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), is a testosterone derivative, the primary cause of male pattern baldness. It attaches to androgen receptors in hair follicles, causing them to shrivel and stop generating hair.
Testosterone does not directly induce hair loss; rather, it is a precursor to DHT. Higher amounts of testosterone can cause an increase in DHT.
Estrogen, which is more common in women, can protect hair follicles. Lower estrogen levels, as observed during menopause, can cause greater hair loss.
Thyroid hormones control metabolism and can influence
hair growth
. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can cause hair loss.
Cortisol is a stress hormone. Chronic stress can cause high cortisol levels, which can contribute to hair loss.
Lifestyle and Stress
The lack of key minerals such as iron, zinc, biotin, and vitamins A, C, D, and E can cause hair loss. It maintains healthy hair and requires a well-balanced diet that is rich in protein and healthy fats.
Overuse of strong
shampoos
,
conditioners
, and styling chemicals can harm hair and cause breakage. Choose mild, sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners. The frequent use of heat-styling appliances such as blow dryers, curling irons, and straighteners can cause hair to weaken. Use heat protectants and keep heat style to a minimum.
Regular physical activity boosts blood circulation, which increases nutrition delivery to hair follicles and promotes healthy hair growth.
Identifying Early Signs of Hair Fall
The symptoms of baldness can also vary from person to person. Some people may have hair loss around the temples. This means that not every person suffering from hair loss will show all the symptoms of baldness.
Effective Solutions for Hair Fall in Men
Minoxidil
: An over-the-counter topical medication that promotes hair growth by boosting blood flow to the follicles. It is applied straight to the scalp twice a day. It can help regrow hair and decrease hair loss.
Finasteride
: Oral medication that reduces levels of DHT, a hormone linked to hair loss. It is taken once a day and may reduce hair loss and promote hair regrowth.
Dutasteride
: Similar to finasteride, but blocks a broader set of enzymes that convert testosterone to DHT. It is more effective than finasteride in certain situations, but it may also have more negative effects.
Medical Treatments
Medical treatments may be beneficial for hair loss in men. The most commonly used treatments are
minoxidil
, finasteride, dutasteride, platelet-rich plasma therapy, low-level laser therapy, and hair growth shampoos and topical treatments.
Minoxidil and Finasteride
Minoxidil
: It is a vasodilator that improves blood flow to hair follicles, promoting hair growth. It is applied straight to the scalp twice daily. Some report more hair loss at first, which is usually an indication that the treatment is effective. Continuous use is required to sustain the outcomes. Stopping treatment can cause the loss of newly growing hair.
Finasteride
: Finasteride inhibits 5-alpha reductase, an enzyme that transforms testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Lowering DHT levels can prevent hair follicle shrinkage and slow down hair loss. It may take several months (4–6) to reap the benefit. It may help decrease or stop hair loss and encourage hair regeneration.
Hair Transplants
The main features of hair transplant techniques are:
Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE)
: Individual hair follicles are taken from a donor location (usually the back or sides of the head) and transplanted into thinning or balding areas.
Scarring
is minimal, recuperation is faster, and the result is more natural-looking. Suitable for people who prefer shorter hairstyles.
Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT)
: A strip of scalp containing hair follicles is removed from the donor area, then dissected and transplanted into the balding areas. It can harvest a greater number of follicles in a single session, which may be advantageous in cases of severe hair loss.
PRP Therapy
Platelet-rich plasma therapy supports healing, regeneration, and growth. It involves three steps such as extracting blood, processing it, and injecting it directly into the affected area. The study discovered that PRP can boost hair growth and thickness while also protecting hair follicles from early shedding. In another state, PRP may help increase hair thickness and density.
Natural Remedies
Essential Oils
: Rosemary oil promotes hair growth and circulation to the scalp. Dilute with a carrier oil, such as coconut oil, and massage. Peppermint oil can enhance blood circulation and encourage hair development. Apply it to the scalp after diluting it with a carrier oil.
Herbal Treatments
: Saw palmetto is commonly used as a supplement to prevent DHT, a hormone associated with hair loss. Before beginning any new supplement, consult with your healthcare provider or
dermatologists
. Nettle root is used to reduce DHT and promote hair growth.
Dietary Adjustments
: Incorporate foods high in vital vitamins and minerals, such as biotin from eggs, almonds, and seeds. Iron is present in lean meats, spinach, and legumes. Omega-3 fatty acids are present in fatty fish, flaxseed, and walnuts. Vitamin D is found in fatty fish, fortified foods, and in sunlight. Drink plenty of water to keep your hair and scalp moisturized.
Scalp Massage
: Regular scalp massage can enhance blood circulation and encourage hair growth. Use your fingertips to gently massage the scalp in circular strokes for a few minutes per day.
Aloe Vera Gel
: It can be applied straight to the scalp. It may help soothe irritation, reduce
dandruff
, and condition hair. Apply fresh aloe vera gel, leave for 30 minutes, and rinse.
Onion Juice
: It has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, which could stimulate hair follicles and hair health. Extract onion juice, apply it to your scalp for 15–30 minutes, and then wash your hair with a gentle shampoo.
Fenugreek Seeds
: Fenugreek seeds are claimed to promote hair development and decrease dandruff. Soak fenugreek seeds overnight, then crush them into a paste, apply to the scalp, and leave on for 30 minutes before rinsing.
Green Tea
: Green tea contains
antioxidants
, which may help with hair growth. Brew green tea, cool, and rinse.
Avoiding Harsh Chemicals
: Use mild, sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners. Avoid overuse of heat styling equipment and harsh chemical treatments.
Stress Management
: Include stress-relieving activities like exercise, meditation, yoga, and hobbies. Reducing stress can improve hair health.
