<p><b></b><span>There are many reasons why hair loss in men can occur. In this blog, we will look at some of the common causes and solutions.</span></p>
<h2><b>Understanding Hair Fall in Men</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Understanding Hair Fall in Men" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Understanding_Hair_Fall_in_Men_1_480x480.jpg?v=1725949881"/></div>
<p><span>Male <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/androgenetic-alopecia-causes-treatments-and-home-remedies">androgenetic alopecia</a> is the most common cause of <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-fall-hair-loss">hair loss</a> in men. The hair loss is progressive. Terminal hairs are gradually converted into vellus hairs in a highly predictable fashion, which depletes the scalp and causes baldness.</span></p>
<h3><b>Common Causes of Male Hair Loss</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Common Causes of Male Hair Loss" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Common_Causes_of_Male_Hair_Loss_480x480.jpg?v=1725949880"/></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>The most prevalent cause of hair loss is a hereditary disorder that develops with age. This disorder is known as androgenic alopecia, male-pattern <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/bald-patches">baldness</a>, and female-pattern baldness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Hormonal changes caused by pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, and thyroid disorders can all result in permanent or temporary hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Certain medications, including those used to treat cancer, arthritis, depression, heart disease, gout, and high blood pressure, can cause hair loss as a side effect.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Many people notice <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-thinning">hair thinning</a> for several months following a physical or mental trauma. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Excessive hairstyling or hairstyles that pull your hair tight, such as pigtails or cornrows.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Genetics and Male Pattern Baldness</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Genetics and Male Pattern Baldness" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Genetics_and_Male_Pattern_Baldness_480x480.jpg?v=1725949880"/></div>
<p><span>Male pattern baldness is generally inherited, which males obtain from their mothers. However, it is not defined by a single gene; several genes contribute to the risk. This complicates the inheritance pattern and makes it less predictable.</span></p>
<p><span>The androgen receptor gene is the most important genetic component involved. Androgens, including dihydrotestosterone (DHT), play an important role in hair loss. Men with a genetic predisposition to have more androgen receptors in their hair follicles may be more vulnerable to the effects of DHT, resulting in hair thinning and loss.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have a family history of baldness, you are more likely to develop it as well. However, male pattern baldness can occur without a strong family history, as genetics can be complex and incorporate several factors.</span></p>
<h3><b>Hormonal Changes</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Hormonal Changes" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Hormonal_Changes_480x480.jpg?v=1725949880"/></div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), is a testosterone derivative, the primary cause of male pattern baldness. It attaches to androgen receptors in hair follicles, causing them to shrivel and stop generating hair.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Testosterone does not directly induce hair loss; rather, it is a precursor to DHT. Higher amounts of testosterone can cause an increase in DHT.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Estrogen, which is more common in women, can protect hair follicles. Lower estrogen levels, as observed during menopause, can cause greater hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Thyroid hormones control metabolism and can influence <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hair-regrow-serum%20">hair growth</a>. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can cause hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Cortisol is a stress hormone. Chronic stress can cause high cortisol levels, which can contribute to hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Lifestyle and Stress</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Lifestyle and Stress" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Lifestyle_and_Stress_480x480.jpg?v=1725949880"/></div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The lack of key minerals such as iron, zinc, biotin, and vitamins A, C, D, and E can cause hair loss. It maintains healthy hair and requires a well-balanced diet that is rich in protein and healthy fats. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Overuse of strong <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/shampoos">shampoos</a>, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/conditioners">conditioners</a>, and styling chemicals can harm hair and cause breakage. Choose mild, sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners. The frequent use of heat-styling appliances such as blow dryers, curling irons, and straighteners can cause hair to weaken. Use heat protectants and keep heat style to a minimum.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Regular physical activity boosts blood circulation, which increases nutrition delivery to hair follicles and promotes healthy hair growth.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Identifying Early Signs of Hair Fall</b></h3>

<p><span>The symptoms of baldness can also vary from person to person. Some people may have hair loss around the temples. This means that not every person suffering from hair loss will show all the symptoms of baldness.</span></p>

<h2><b>Effective Solutions for Hair Fall in Men</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Effective Solutions for Hair Fall in Men" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Effective_Solutions_for_Hair_Fall_in_Men_480x480.jpg?v=1725949880"/></div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Minoxidil</b><span>: An over-the-counter topical medication that promotes hair growth by boosting blood flow to the follicles. It is applied straight to the scalp twice a day. It can help regrow hair and decrease hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Finasteride</b><span>: Oral medication that reduces levels of DHT, a hormone linked to hair loss. It is taken once a day and may reduce hair loss and promote hair regrowth.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Dutasteride</b><span>: Similar to finasteride, but blocks a broader set of enzymes that convert testosterone to DHT. It is more effective than finasteride in certain situations, but it may also have more negative effects.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Medical Treatments</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Medical Treatments" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Medical_Treatments_1_480x480.jpg?v=1725949880"/></div>
<p><span>Medical treatments may be beneficial for hair loss in men. The most commonly used treatments are <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/scalp-solution">minoxidil</a>, finasteride, dutasteride, platelet-rich plasma therapy, low-level laser therapy, and hair growth shampoos and topical treatments.</span></p>
<h4><b>Minoxidil and Finasteride</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Minoxidil</b><span>: It is a vasodilator that improves blood flow to hair follicles, promoting hair growth. It is applied straight to the scalp twice daily. Some report more hair loss at first, which is usually an indication that the treatment is effective. Continuous use is required to sustain the outcomes. Stopping treatment can cause the loss of newly growing hair.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Finasteride</b><span>: Finasteride inhibits 5-alpha reductase, an enzyme that transforms testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Lowering DHT levels can prevent hair follicle shrinkage and slow down hair loss. It may take several months (4–6) to reap the benefit. It may help decrease or stop hair loss and encourage hair regeneration. </span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Hair Transplants</b></h4>
<p><span>The main features of hair transplant techniques are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE)</b><span>: Individual hair follicles are taken from a donor location (usually the back or sides of the head) and transplanted into thinning or balding areas. <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">Scarring</a> is minimal, recuperation is faster, and the result is more natural-looking. Suitable for people who prefer shorter hairstyles.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT)</b><span>: A strip of scalp containing hair follicles is removed from the donor area, then dissected and transplanted into the balding areas. It can harvest a greater number of follicles in a single session, which may be advantageous in cases of severe hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>PRP Therapy</b></h4>
<p><span>Platelet-rich plasma therapy supports healing, regeneration, and growth. It involves three steps such as extracting blood, processing it, and injecting it directly into the affected area. The study discovered that PRP can boost hair growth and thickness while also protecting hair follicles from early shedding. In another state, PRP may help increase hair thickness and density.</span></p>
