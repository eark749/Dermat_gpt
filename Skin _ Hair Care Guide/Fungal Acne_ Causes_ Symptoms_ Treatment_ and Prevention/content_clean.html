<p><span>Fungal acne, also known as pityrosporum folliculitis, is a type of acne caused by an overgrowth of yeast on the skin. Unlike traditional acne, fungal acne is caused by a fungus rather than bacteria. Here is what you need to know about fungal acne:</span></p>
<p><b>Causes</b><span>: Fungal acne is caused by an overgrowth of yeast called Malassezia on the skin. This yeast is normally found on the skin but can overgrow and cause inflammation in the hair follicles, leading to acne.</span></p>
<p><b>Symptoms</b><span>: Fungal acne appears as small, itchy bumps that are usually uniform in size and shape. Unlike traditional acne, it is often found on the chest, back, and shoulders rather than on the face. Fungal acne may also be accompanied by redness and scaling of the skin.</span></p>
<p><b>Treatment</b><span>: Fungal acne can be treated with antifungal medications like topical or oral antifungal creams or shampoos containing ingredients like <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/ketoconazole-shampoo-what-you-need-to-know">ketoconazole</a>, selenium sulfide, or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/the-benefits-of-zinc-pyrithione-for-hair">pyrithione zinc</a>. In some cases, oral antibiotics may be prescribed to treat bacterial infections that can occur as a result of scratching and irritating the affected area.</span></p>
<p><b>Prevention</b><span>: To prevent fungal acne, it is important to keep your skin clean and dry. Avoid using heavy, oily products on your skin, and make sure to shower and change your clothes after exercising or sweating. Use an antifungal body wash or shampoo if you are prone to fungal acne on your body or scalp.</span></p>
<p><span>It is important to note that not all bumps on the skin are fungal acne. If you are unsure whether you have fungal acne or another skin condition, it is best to <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">see a dermatologist</a> for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.</span></p>

<p><span>Fungal acne, also known as pityrosporum folliculitis, is a type of skin condition that is caused by an overgrowth of yeast on the skin. Unlike traditional acne, which is caused by bacteria, fungal acne is caused by a type of fungus called Malassezia.</span></p>
<p><span>Malassezia is a type of yeast that is found on the skin of most people. However, in some cases, the yeast can overgrow and cause inflammation in the hair follicles, resulting in acne-like bumps on the skin. Fungal acne typically appears on the chest, back, and shoulders, but it can also occur on the face.</span></p>
<p><span>The symptoms of fungal acne include small, itchy bumps that are often uniform in size and shape. These bumps can be red or white and may be accompanied by scaling or flaking of the skin. Unlike traditional acne, fungal acne is often not responsive to traditional acne treatments, such as <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/is-benzoyl-peroxide-good-for-acne">benzoyl peroxide</a> or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/salicylic-range">salicylic acid</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Fungal acne can be treated with antifungal medications, such as topical or oral antifungal creams, shampoos, or medications. It is important to keep the affected area clean and dry and to avoid using heavy, oily products on the skin. If you suspect that you have fungal acne, it is best to see a dermatologist for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.</span></p>
<h3><b>Understanding Malassezia</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Understanding Malassezia" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/24_397a3909-da53-4363-8dfd-8a3ad389726c_480x480.png?v=1699695071"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Malassezia is a genus of yeast that is commonly found on the skin of humans and animals. While it is a normal part of the skin's microbiome, an overgrowth of Malassezia can lead to various skin conditions, including fungal acne, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/seborrheic-dermatitis">seborrheic dermatitis</a>, and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/dandruff">dandruff</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>There are several different species of Malassezia, but the most common species found on human skin are Malassezia globosa and Malassezia restricta. These species are able to break down sebum, the oil that is produced by the sebaceous glands in the skin, into fatty acids that can irritate the skin and cause inflammation.</span></p>
<p><span>In some cases, an overgrowth of Malassezia can be triggered by factors such as hormonal changes, stress, or use of certain medications. In other cases, the exact cause of the overgrowth is unknown.</span></p>
<p><span>While Malassezia can contribute to certain skin conditions, it is important to note that it is not always the sole cause. Other factors, such as genetics, environmental factors, and immune system function, can also play a role in the development of skin conditions.</span></p>
<p><span>To treat skin conditions associated with Malassezia overgrowth, antifungal medications, such as topical or oral antifungal creams or shampoos, may be prescribed. In addition, maintaining good skin hygiene and avoiding triggers, such as heavy or oily skin products, can help to prevent an overgrowth of Malassezia and reduce the risk of developing skin conditions.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span><img alt="Skincare Routine for Fungal Acne" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/33_eaa3c1eb-50f4-4640-92f3-1e1af8d8e634_480x480.png?v=1699695412"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Fungal acne, also known as pityrosporum folliculitis, is a type of acne caused by an overgrowth of yeast on the skin. Unlike traditional acne, fungal acne doesn't respond well to traditional acne treatments, and requires a different approach. Here is a skincare routine for fungal acne:</span></p>
<p><b>Use a gentle cleanser</b><span>: Look for a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-foaming-face-wash">cleanser</a> that is free of sulfates, parabens, and other harsh ingredients that can irritate the skin. Opt for a gentle, pH-balanced cleanser that is specifically formulated for fungal acne.</span></p>
<p><b>Use an antifungal treatment</b><span>: Antifungal ingredients such as ketoconazole, selenium sulfide, or pyrithione zinc can help to combat the overgrowth of yeast on the skin. Look for a product that contains one of these ingredients and apply it to the affected areas of the skin.</span></p>
<p><b>Apply a hydrating serum</b><span>: Fungal acne can leave the skin feeling dry and irritated, so it's important to use a hydrating serum to restore moisture to the skin. Look for a serum that contains <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hyaluronic-skinbooster-serum">hyaluronic acid</a>, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/how-to-use-glycerin-in-your-skincare-routine">glycerin</a>, or ceramides.</span></p>
<p><b>Use a non-comedogenic moisturizer</b><span>: Look for a lightweight, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/non-comedogenic-skincare-products">non-comedogenic</a> moisturizer that won't clog pores. Avoid heavy creams or lotions that can exacerbate fungal acne.</span></p>
<p><b>Use sunscreen</b><span>: Protect your skin from further damage by applying a broad-spectrum <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/sunscreens">sunscreen</a> with at least SPF 30. Look for a sunscreen that is free of oils and fragrances, and is specifically formulated for acne-prone skin.</span></p>
<p><b>Avoid certain ingredients</b><span>: Fungal acne is often aggravated by certain ingredients, including fatty acids, esters, and polysorbates. Look for skincare products that are free of these ingredients, and avoid using oils and oil-based products on the affected areas of your skin.</span></p>
<p><span>Consider seeing a dermatologist: If your fungal acne doesn't improve with at-home treatments, or if you have severe or persistent acne, it's important to see a dermatologist. They can prescribe stronger antifungal medications or recommend other treatments that may be more effective.</span></p>
<h3><b>Exfoliation</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Exfoliation" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/34_c55ecddf-8f82-468c-ae5f-ec52ec65ff5d_480x480.png?v=1699695447"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Exfoliation is the process of removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin, typically using a physical or chemical exfoliant. Exfoliation can help to improve skin texture, unclog pores, and promote cell turnover.</span></p>
<p><span>Physical <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/best-exfoliants-for-face-skin">exfoliants</a> are products that contain abrasive particles or tools that physically scrub away dead skin cells. Common physical exfoliants include scrubs, brushes, and sponges. It's important to use gentle pressure when using physical exfoliants, as too much pressure can damage the skin.</span></p>
<p><span>Chemical exfoliants, on the other hand, use acids or enzymes to dissolve dead skin cells. Common chemical exfoliants include alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) such as <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/glycolic-acid">glycolic acid</a> and lactic acid, and beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs) such as salicylic acid. Chemical exfoliants can be gentler on the skin than physical exfoliants, but it's important to choose the right type of exfoliant for your skin type and to follow the instructions carefully.</span></p>
<p><span>It's important to note that over-exfoliation can damage the skin, leading to dryness, irritation, and sensitivity. It's recommended to exfoliate no more than 2-3 times per week for most skin types, and to adjust the frequency and type of exfoliation based on your skin's needs. Always follow up exfoliation with a hydrating moisturizer to protect the skin's barrier.</span></p>
<h3><b>Moisturization</b></h3>

</div>
<p><span>Moisturization is the process of hydrating the skin to help it maintain a healthy balance of moisture. Moisturizing is an important part of any skincare routine, as it can help to improve skin texture, protect the <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/skin-barrier">skin barrier</a>, and prevent dryness, flakiness, and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/preventing-premature-ageing-the-ultimate-guide-to-skincare-products">premature aging</a>.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/moisturisers">Moisturizers</a> come in a variety of forms, including creams, lotions, gels, and oils. When choosing a moisturizer, it's important to consider your skin type, as different skin types require different levels of hydration and ingredients. For example, if you have oily or acne-prone skin, you may want to choose a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer that won't clog pores. If you have dry or sensitive skin, you may want to choose a heavier, more hydrating moisturizer that contains ingredients like hyaluronic acid or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/top-5-benefits-of-ceramides">ceramides</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>It's important to apply moisturizer to clean, dry skin, and to use gentle, upward motions to avoid pulling or stretching the skin. You should also pay attention to the ingredients in your moisturizer, and avoid products that contain irritants or allergens that may cause irritation or breakouts.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to using a moisturizer, there are other steps you can take to help keep your skin hydrated, such as drinking plenty of water, avoiding hot showers or baths, and using a humidifier in dry environments.</span></p>

<p><span>Topical medication refers to medications that are applied directly to the skin to treat various skin conditions, such as acne, eczema, psoriasis, and fungal infections. Topical medications can come in various forms, including creams, lotions, gels, ointments, and foams.</span></p>

<h2><b>Prevention of Fungal Acne</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Prevention of Fungal Acne" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/37_e69dbb6b-9ddc-4158-922d-ce762b520dc9_480x480.png?v=1699695732"/></div>
<p><span>Fungal acne, also known as Malassezia folliculitis, is a skin condition caused by an overgrowth of yeast on the skin. While it can be difficult to prevent completely, there are some steps you can take to help reduce your risk of developing fungal acne:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Keep your skin clean and dry</b><span>: Fungi thrive in warm, moist environments, so it's important to keep your skin clean and dry to help prevent their growth. Shower or bathe daily, and avoid wearing tight, restrictive clothing that can trap sweat and moisture against your skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid using heavy oils and emollients</b><span>: Some oils and emollients, such as coconut oil and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/shea-butter-benefits-for-skin-dermatologists-guide">shea butter</a>, can promote the growth of Malassezia yeast. If you're prone to fungal acne, consider using lighter, non-comedogenic products that won't clog your pores.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use antifungal treatments</b><span>: If you have a history of fungal acne or are prone to the condition, you may want to use antifungal treatments as a preventative measure. Antifungal shampoos and body washes, such as those containing ketoconazole or pyrithione zinc, can be effective in preventing the growth of Malassezia yeast.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Be careful with makeup</b><span>: Some makeup products can contain ingredients that promote the growth of Malassezia yeast, so be sure to choose products that are labelled as non-comedogenic and avoid heavy, oily products.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Maintain a healthy lifestyle</b><span>: A healthy diet and lifestyle can help support healthy skin and reduce your risk of fungal acne. Eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and managing stress can all help to promote healthy skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It's important to note that if you do develop fungal acne, it's a treatable condition with proper care and treatment. If you're concerned about your skin or have any questions about preventing or treating fungal acne, be sure to speak with your healthcare provider or a dermatologist.</span></p>
<h3><b>Diet and Fungal Acne</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Diet and Fungal Acne" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/38_1f945eb4-9890-4053-b660-e8fb2970ca5d_480x480.png?v=1699695772"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>While there isn't a direct link between diet and fungal acne, certain dietary factors can indirectly contribute to the development or exacerbation of the condition. For example, diets high in sugar and refined carbohydrates can promote the growth of yeast on the skin, which can increase the risk of fungal acne. Additionally, consuming foods that you are allergic or sensitive to can lead to inflammation in the body, which can also contribute to skin issues.</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, some foods may be beneficial for promoting healthy skin and reducing the risk of fungal acne. For example, foods that are rich in vitamins A, C, and E, as well as omega-3 fatty acids, can help support healthy skin and reduce inflammation. Examples of such foods include leafy greens, colorful fruits and vegetables, fatty fish, and nuts and seeds.</span></p>
<p><span>Overall, while diet may not directly cause fungal acne, it's important to maintain a healthy, balanced diet to support overall skin health and reduce the risk of skin issues. If you're concerned about your diet and its impact on your skin, consider speaking with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian for personalized advice and recommendations.</span></p>
<h3><b>Probiotics and Fungal Acne</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Probiotics and Fungal Acne" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/39_16bd2225-cec0-46e8-bb72-fb2651ba2bb1_480x480.png?v=1699695810"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that live in our gut and help maintain a healthy balance of microorganisms in the body. Some studies have suggested that probiotics may have a positive impact on skin health, including the prevention and treatment of fungal acne.</span></p>
<p><span>One theory is that probiotics can help support the immune system and reduce inflammation in the body, which can contribute to a healthier skin microbiome and reduce the risk of fungal acne. Additionally, probiotics may help to crowd out harmful bacteria and yeasts, including the type of yeast that can cause fungal acne.</span></p>
<p><span>There is limited research on the specific strains of probiotics that may be effective in preventing or treating fungal acne, but some studies have suggested that Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum may be helpful. Additionally, consuming probiotic-rich foods, such as yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut, may also be beneficial for supporting a healthy gut and skin microbiome.</span></p>
<p><span>While probiotics may be helpful in preventing and treating fungal acne, it's important to note that they should be used as part of a comprehensive skincare and health regimen. If you're interested in using probiotics to support your skin health, be sure to speak with your healthcare provider for personalized recommendations and advice.</span></p>
