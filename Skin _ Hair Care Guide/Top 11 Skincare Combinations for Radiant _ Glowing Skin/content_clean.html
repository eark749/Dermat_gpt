We here at </span><span>Clinikally </span><span>have come to your rescue and have made an exhaustive list of the best skincare pairings. But before learning about the skincare duos, let us understand the basic science between combining and using two skin care products together. Also, don’t forget, you can always </span><span>consult the dermatologist</span><span> for the best skincare advice.</span></p>
<h2><b>Understanding the Art of Skincare Combinations<br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="Understanding the Art of Skincare Combinations" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_4_-_2024-01-04T133841.838_480x480.png?v=1704355739"/></div>
<p><span>Skincare products, if combined in a science-backed up manner, after doing all the research, will prove to be a boon for skin. It is so because twice the original benefits can be obtained. However, if there is negligence and absence of rationing behind skincare product pairings, it can prove to be a heart-wrenching experience.</span></p>
<h3><strong>The Science Behind Skincare Synergy</strong></h3>
<p><span>While combining the products, always keep in mind the following tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Determine your skin type, whether it’s dry, oily, normal, combination, dry and sensitive, or oily and sensitive.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Understand the issue that you want to address.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Go by resolving one issue at a time. For example, if you want to get rid of pimples and target signs of ageing, choose what you want to address first.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Don’t shock your skin with a sudden gush off too many products.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Incorporate skincare products into your routine slowly and steadily.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Always do a patch test first, before using the products together.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>If you experience any reaction while using the products, </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist"><span>consult a dermatologist</span><span>.</span></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Benefits of Pairing Skincare Products</strong></h3>
<p><span>Pairing skincare products offer many benefits to the skin such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Combining products can boost their individual benefits, leading to more effective skincare results.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><span>Layering products allow for addressing multiple skin concerns simultaneously, such as hydration, ageing, and acne.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Tailoring a skincare routine with paired products caters to specific skin types and needs for personalised care.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Certain combinations improve the skin's texture and enhance the absorption of key ingredients.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Some ingredients work better together, enhancing each other’s properties for optimal skin health.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Efficient use of complementary products can be more economical than relying on single, multi-purpose products.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong> The Magic of Combining Ingredients</strong></h3>
<p><span>Combining various ingredients and making a unique skincare cocktail for your daily regimen, can be beneficial and therapeutic both. It allows you to understand your skin better. Hence, you indulge in some quality ‘me-time’, wherein you can not only pamper your skin, but also avail maximum benefits out of that.</span></p>

<div><img alt="Top 11 Skincare Combinations You'll Absolutely Love" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_4_-_2024-01-04T134246.664_480x480.png?v=1704355983"/></div>
<p><span>Below is the exhaustive list of top 11 skincare duos that your skin will love.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#1 Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C - The Hydration Boosters</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>HYALURONIC ACID:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Looking at the mirror and not liking the dull and dehydrated appearance on the face. Well, we, at </span><span>Clinikally </span><span>are here at your rescue. Usually, due to advancing age, stress or surrounding weather and environment, the skin usually gets dry, due to loss of water. To important things to do in such a condition are:</span></p>
<p><span># to provide water/ hydration to the skin.</span></p>
<p><span>Think of a dry sponge that absorbs all the water when kept immersed in it. Well, that’s what Hyaluronic Acid also does. When applied onto a damp skin, it absorbs all the water molecules, almost 100 times more than its own weight and pulls it onto the top most layer of the skin. As a result, the otherwise dried out skin gets well hydrated, making it appear plump and healthy. </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hyaluronic-skinbooster-serum"><span>Clinikally Hyaluronic SkinBooster Serum </span></a><span>is the perfect choice for this. Apply it onto a damp or slightly wet skin and massage it in until it gets completely absorbed. Plumped appearance is easily noticeable due to intense hydration. As a result, there is a reduced appearance of fine lines and wrinkles as well.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>VITAMIN C:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Vitamin C on the other hand, in the form of various derivatives, also exhibits a hydrating effect. Magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, commonly referred to as MAP, is one of the most stable forms that makes it highly preferable. It is readily absorbed into the deeper layers of skin and provides intense hydration. In addition, it also reduces the water loss from the surface of the skin. Vitamin C also aids in the formation of collagen. Collagen is basically the glue that binds the skin cells together. Decrease in this protein results in increased water loss. Get your hands on </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-vitamin-c3-serum"><span>Clinikally Vitamin C3+ Serum</span></a><span> to level up your skin care regimen. It not only hydrates the skin, but also boosts the natural radiance as well. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>HYALURONIC ACID + VITAMIN C</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Hence, both the ingredients together, effectively contribute to increased hydration level of the skin. This makes the skin appear plumped up and tightened., thereby enhancing the youthful appearance of the skin. The benefits of both the skincare icons can be availed by utilising </span><span>Clinikally Hyaluronic SkinBooster Serum </span><span>for the hydration boost and layering it up with </span><span>Sesderma C-VIT Moisturizing Facial Cream</span><span> to lock the hydration in while also availing benefits of Vitamin C. Also, don’t forget to put the </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-sunprotect-sunscreen-spf-50"><span>Clinikally SunProtect Sunscreen SPF 50/PA+++</span></a><span> for an all round skin protection.</span></p>
<h3><strong></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>#2Retinol and Niacinamide - Age-Defying Duo </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>RETINOL:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>As we age, due to hormonal disruptions and various biochemical changes in the body, ageing symptoms begin to get pronounced. As a result, smile lines start becoming wrinkle lines, crinkles<a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-ultra-heal-under-eye-cream"> beneath the eyes </a>start resembling crow’s feet, lines start to develop on the forehead, age spots become darker, melasma experiences a spike, and the list goes on and on. While we must gracefully accept this phase, little measures in the skin regimen can be incorporated to slow down the appearance of ageing.</span></p>
<p><span>Incorporate Retinol into your skincare routine if you wish to minimise the appearance of ageing on your face. Retinols penetrate deeper into skin and stimulate the proliferation of certain cells that result in an increased production of fibres, keratin and collagen. As a result, the skin strengthens from inside. On the outside, this strengthening gets reflected as a firmer and tighter skin. The appearance of the ageing lines gets reduced significantly. </span></p>
<p><span>Make </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-skin-renewer-retinol-serum"><span>Clinikally Skin Renewer Retinol Serum </span></a><span>your best friend if you wish to minimise the appearance of ageing lines. Apply it at night. However, it is recommended to gradually introduce retinol into your skincare routine. Start by using it once or twice a week, and gradually increase the frequency so as to give the skin some time to adjust to its action as retinol can cause irritation to the skin in the beginning. Or leave it to the best- </span><span>consult our dermatologist </span><span>prior to using retinol. Don’t forget to layer it up with </span><span>Clinikally SunProtect Sunscreen SPF 50/PA+++ </span><span>in the morning.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>NIACINAMIDE:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Niacinamide, when applied on to the skin, acts as an anti-ageing agent due to a burst of antioxidants. Free oxygen radicals that get formed due to pollution, stress or other detrimental factors often cause skin damage, leading to enhanced appearance of ageing signs. Antioxidants eliminate these free radicals, thereby enhancing the skin appearance. In addition, Niacinamide also minimises the appearance of age spots. It effectively lightens hyperpigmentation and melasma by preventing the transfer of melanin producing and storing cells to the surface of the skin. As a result the existing spots get lightened and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">prevention of further hyperpigmentation </a>is also achieved. </span></p>
<p><span>Introduce </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-nia-serum"><span>Clinikally The Ultimate NIA (10% Niacinamide) Serum </span></a><span>into your skincare routine to achieve a skin that beats the ageing signs. Apply 2-3 drops of this serum on a clean surface before applying. </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-foaming-face-wash"><span>Clinikally Foaming Face Wash </span></a><span>can be used prior to using the serum to remove oil and dirt gently.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>RETINOL + NIACINAMIDE:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>For enhanced anti-ageing benefits, these products can be effectively combined. Incorporate Retinol in your p.m skin care routine and niacinamide can be used both the times. To avoid the hassle of using two products, use </span><span>Obril Gold Skin Serum </span><span>which combines the benefits and action of both retinol and niacinamide in one product. </span></p>
<h3><strong>#3Rosehip Oil and Vitamin E - Skin Repair Combo </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>ROSEHIP OIL:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Rosehip Oil is an old-age therapeutic remedy for a variety of skin concerns. It contains a variety of vitamins, healthy fats and minerals for the well being of skin health. It offers high protection against inflammation and oxidative stress. Due to increased anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, rosehip oil plays an important role in repair of skin. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>VITAMIN E:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Vitamin E is a potent antioxidant that provides a wide array of benefits for the skin. This versatile nutrient offers protection against UV damage when applied on to the skin. It has antioxidants that aids in combating harmful effects of free radicals on cells. This results in a significant reduction of inflammation throughout the body. Reduced inflammation, in turn helps in the repair of the skin. Notably, vitamin E gets stored in both the outer epidermis and deeper dermal layers of the skin. This storage explains its prevalence in many skincare products. It plays a vital role in nourishment and protection of the skin from the damages of oxidative stress. </span></p>
<p><span>Elovera Cream</span><span> is a great choice to avail the benefits of Vitamin E that may aid in skin repair. It not only hydrates and moisturises the skin, but also reduces scars and marks. Use it twice daily to achieve optimal results.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>ROSEHIP OIL + VITAMIN E:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>To achieve maximum skin repair, Rosehip Oil can be combined with Vitamin E for an even greater effect. Apply Rosehip Oil on a clean face. Moisturise it with a Vitamin E cream or lotion.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#4Tea Tree Oil and Witch Hazel - Acne-Fighting Allies </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>TEA TREE OIL:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Tea Tree Oil is an essential oil that is a popular skincare remedy to treat acne. It reduces the production of sebum in the skin, thereby considerably reducing acne. It also exhibits antioxidant and anti-microbial properties. Achieve a skin devoid of acne by cleaning your face with </span><span>Actame Face Wash</span><span> due to antimicrobial action of tea tree oil. Use it daily to achieve flawless skin.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>WITCH HAZEL:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Witch Hazel Extract inhibits the formation of the layer of microorganisms called biofilm on the skin. It also decreases the production of toxins. As a result, pimples and acne are reduced. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>TEA TREE OIL + WITCH HAZEL:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Combining both the products can help achieve an overall decrease in the incidence of acne and pimples due to the harmony in their mechanisms of action.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#5 Shea Butter and Ceramides - Nourish and Protect </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>SHEA BUTTER:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Shea butter, a luscious and nurturing emollient, is a skincare enthusiast's delight. It is solid when nestled at room temperature and melts seamlessly upon contact with the warmth of skin. It graces the dermis with a plethora of benefits. Its natural sun screening abilities provide a gentle defence against the harsh ultraviolet rays. As a moisturiser, it lavishes the skin with deep hydration, and leaves it feeling velvety soft and supple. Beyond its hydrating prowess, Shea butter is also celebrated for its capacity to soothe inflammation and its potential to diminish the telltale signs of ageing. It successfully imparts a youthful resilience to the skin. If you wish to wrap your skin in a nourishing embrace, one that comforts, protects, and restores, shea butter can be your go-to. <br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Indulge in the goodness of </span><span>New Embryolisse Lait Crème Concentré Multi-function Moisturizer </span><span>that has richness of shea butter along with benefits of other nourishing natural ingredients.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>CERAMIDES:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Ceramides are basically the skin's essential lipids and are fundamental for maintaining a healthy skin barrier. These natural compounds are not only pivotal in hydrating the skin, but also shield it from various environmental assaults and harmful bacteria. </span></p>
<p><span>With the progression of age, our skin's natural ceramide reserves diminish, leading to a compromised skin barrier. This in turn leads to an increased susceptibility to dryness and sensitivity. It further escalates the risk of skin disorders. To counteract this depletion, it becomes essential to incorporate ceramide-rich supplements or skincare products so as to bolster skin health. </span></p>
<p><span>You can get your hands on </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hydrasoothe-moisturiser"><span>Clinikally HydraSoothe Moisturiser</span></a><span>. It is a unique blend of ceramides with other skin nourishing ingredients. As a result, the hydration level of the skin is significantly elevated leading to a supple and more resilient complexion. Moreover, the rejuvenation of ageing skin is supported via production of a protein in the skin called Keratin, thus diminishing fine lines, and bolstering the skin's defences against photoaging. Embracing ceramides in your skincare routine can thus be a transformative step towards a hydrated, fortified, and youthful skin appearance due to its skin protecting and nourishing properties.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>SHEA BUTTER + CERAMIDES:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>To avail the benefits of both, it is either recommended to layer the products or to you use a product like </span><span>Neolayr Pro Vitamin-C Face Cream </span><span>that combines the richness of shea butter that intensely nourishes the skin and ceramides that protect the skin barrier, along with other skin nourishing nutrients.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#6 GreenTea Extract and Aloe Vera - Soothing Harmony</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>GREEN TEA EXTRACT:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Tired of red and angry looking skin? Try incorporating the serene essence of green tea extract into your daily skincare routine and witness a drastic transformation. Green Tea Extract is ideal for managing oily, acne-prone skin. It works diligently to purify clogged pores while also offering a reparative touch against the damages of sun exposure. Its abundant treasure-chest of antioxidants function as a shield against environmental stressors, while the inherent anti-inflammatory benefits soothe and calm the irritated and troubled skin. </span><span>Neolayr Pro Acne Control Face Serum </span><span>can be your skincare staple that can help in achieving a radiant, acne and blemish free glow.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>ALOE VERA:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Aloe vera gel, a well known ally against skin damage since ages, offers a shield of protection from the harshness of UV and gamma radiation. While its precise mechanisms are hidden in nature's mystery, the gel is known to spur the production of antioxidant proteins in the skin that neutralise damage causing hydroxyl radicals. This action conserves critical enzymes that play a vital role in fortifying the skin's defensive matrix. In the battle against inflammation, aloe vera proves formidable as it disrupts the inflammation process. Hence, it works as a potent anti-inflammatory elixir that is perfect for soothing the skin and preserving its integrity amidst environmental challenges.</span><span> BABE Aloe Vera Gel </span><span>is 100% pure aloe vera gel that soothes, hydrates and nourishes the skin.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>GREEN TEA EXTRACT + ALOE VERA</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Both these ingredients can be used together to amp up the benefits. Aloe Vera gel or cream like </span><span>New Dewsoft Cream</span><span> can be used after using green tea extract based face cleanser like </span><span>Epique Detoxifying Foam Cleanser</span><span>. Following such a regimen will not only aid in getting relief from redness caused by acne, but will also nourish the skin.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#7 Coenzyme Q10 and Peptides - Youthful Radiance</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>COENZYME Q10:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an integral element for maintaining youthful, radiant skin. It is a powerful antioxidant that shields skin cells from the damaging effects of environmental stressors and UV rays, prevents collagen breakdown and wards off fine lines and wrinkles. It speeds up the production of energy in the skin cells, hence supporting the natural repair and rejuvenation processes of the skin. As a result, the skin keeps looking supple and vibrant. </span></p>
<p><span>As we age, our natural CoQ10 levels dwindle, thus making supplementation through skincare essentials a smart strategy that preserves the elasticity and luminosity of the skin. Its anti-inflammatory properties also make it a soothing ally against common skin concerns, ensuring an even, smooth complexion. Coenzyme Q10 has proved to be a stalwart in the fight against ageing. CoQ10 present in </span><span>Aveil You Glow</span><span> is a cornerstone in the quest for a flawless, glowing appearance.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>PEPTIDES:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Peptides are small chains of amino acids and the building blocks of proteins that are essential for youthful and radiant skin. It is because of peptides that the skin produces more collagen. As mentioned above, collagen is a glue that holds skin cells together, thereby ensuring a firm and smooth texture of the skin. As natural collagen production decreases with age, peptides step in to mitigate the visible effects of ageing by promoting resilience. This results in the reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</span></p>
<p><span>The role of peptides in skin repair and regeneration is also very crucial. They help to heal, rejuvenate, and create a more supple skin surface. Moreover, certain peptides also enhance and improve skin barrier function, which leads to increase in hydration levels and protection against environmental damage. This leads to an enhanced skin radiance. By incorporating peptides in the form of </span><span>Genosys ND Cell Anti-Wrinkle Cream </span><span>into skincare routines, one can effectively support the skin's natural functions and maintain its youthful glow and vitality. This cream can not only be used on the face but also on the neck and decollete area. Another great product is </span><span>Yuderma Skindose Time Filler</span><span> that fights off the visible signs of ageing and gives your skin a fuller appearance.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>COENZYME Q10 and PEPTIDES:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Layering both these components in your skin care routine can be a game changer for ageing skin. It not only aids in keeping fine lines and wrinkles at bay, but also enhances the complexion and skin tone. This ensures an everlasting youthful radiance.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#8 Sunscreen and Antioxidants - Daily Defense</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>SUNSCREEN:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>While a warm, sunny day is everyone’s favourite, and a quick stroll to the nearby park or a run to a grocery store seems like a good option; it is always recommended to immerse yourself in the benefits of sunscreen to keep off photoageing and sunburns at a bay. </span></p>
<p><span>Sun emits harmful Ultraviolet Rays that cause much harm to the skin. There are 2 major types of sunscreen:</span></p>
<p><span><strong># Physical Sunscreen-</strong> Contain ingredients like Titanium Dioxide that reflects and scatters the harmful UV rays</span> <span>to protect the skin from harmful UVA and UVB rays of the skin.</span></p>
<p><span><strong># Chemical Sunscreen-</strong> Contain ingredients such as Avobenzone that absorb the harmful sun rays and convert it into significantly less harmful form of energy such as heat. Use </span><span>Clinikally SunProtect Sunscreen SPF 50/PA+++ </span><span>to safeguard your skin against the harmful rays and effects of sun.</span></p>
<p><span>Always use sunscreen before stepping out in the sun. Keep on reapplying it, as stated on the backside of the product. Sunscreens offer the best daily defence.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>ANTIOXIDANTS</strong>:</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Carotenoids such as Astaxanthin offer the best daily protection against skin damage. Free oxygen radicals get formed due to pollution, stress or other detrimental factors that lead to damage of skin. As a result, the skin loses its charm and youthful radiance. Also, enhanced appearance of ageing signs may also occur. Antioxidants eliminate these free radicals, thereby enhancing the skin appearance.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>SUNSCREEN + ANTIOXIDANTS:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Combining the photo-protective agent with a burst of antioxidants, is a gift that you can give to your skin. </span><span>ISDIN Fotoprotector Fusion Water Sunscreen SPF 50 </span><span>is one such product, that not only fights the ageing action of sun, but also pampers your skin with bursts of antioxidants. This results in a well protected and well nourished skin, everyday.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#9 Collagen and Hyaluronic Acid - Plump and Firm</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>COLLAGEN:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Collagen Is a protein that provides elasticity and firmness to the skin. It is basically the glue that binds the skin cells together. With age, its natural production decreases, which leads to the formation of wrinkles and sagging. Supplementing collagen, either through diet or skincare, can rejuvenate the skin's appearance, promoting a smoother, plumper, and more youthful complexion. It's a vital ingredient in the quest for age-defying, resilient skin. Consider adding </span><span>Peltos Collagen Sleep Mask</span><span> to your skincare routine for a gush of collagen goodness. It is an overnight sleep mask that is to be applied on a cleansed face before bed, so as to wake up to a plumped appearance.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>HYALURONIC ACID:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Due to advancing age, stress or surrounding weather and environment, the skin usually gets dry, due to loss of water. This makes the skin look dehydrated. It also accelerates ageing. Two important things to do in such a condition are:</span></p>
<p><span>#  to provide water/ hydration to the skin.</span></p>
<p><span>#  to lock that hydration in.</span></p>
<p><span>When applied onto a damp skin, hyaluronic acid  absorbs all the water molecules, almost 100 times more than its own weight and pulls it onto the top most layer of the skin. As a result, the otherwise dried out skin gets well hydrated, making it appear plump and healthy. </span><span>Clinikally Hyaluronic SkinBooster Serum </span><span>is the perfect choice for this. Apply it onto a damp or slightly wet skin and massage it in until it gets completely absorbed. Plumped appearance is easily noticeable due to intense hydration. As a result, there is a reduced appearance of fine lines and wrinkles as well. Hyaluronic acid, definitely, is a hydration marvel that deeply moisturises, plumps skin, reduces wrinkles, and imparts a dewy, youthful glow.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>COLLAGEN + HYALURONIC ACID:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Using these 2 ingredients synergistically in skincare not only makes the skin look plump, but also firms the skin from within. Washing the face with hyaluronic acid cleanser such as </span><span>Actame C Face Wash </span><span>can be done, followed with the collagen mask for plumping the skin. Following such steps will ensure that your skin remains hydrated, nourished and plumped.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#10 Argan Oil and Glycerin - Ultimate Hydration </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>ARGAN OIL:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Argan oil is revered in beauty circles for its richness of vitamin E. Argan Oil also enhances skin hydration and water retention levels. A boon for oily complexions, it is great at regulating sebum or oil production of the skin, thus ensuring balanced hydration without excess oiliness. Its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant qualities not only fight acne but also fortify the skin's barrier, thus preserving and retaining the moisture in the skin. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>GLYCERIN:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Glycerin is referred to as a humectant as it attracts, draws and locks in moisture into the skin, thereby quenching the thirst of the skin. Its supremacy in retaining hydration, transforms the skin, and makes it supple and smooth, while fortifying its natural barrier alongside. A must-have for a dewy, radiant complexion, glycerin is a beacon of nourishment in the realm of skin hydration.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>ARGAN OIL + GLYCERIN:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>A rare skincare duo, but super-effective as glycerin attracts water molecules into the skin, and argan oil aids in its retention. The outcome is super-hydrated and fresh skin.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#11 AHA/BHA and Aloe Vera</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>AHA/BHA:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Various acids help in skin exfoliation by gently sloughing off the dead skin cells, to reveal a smooth, baby like skin beneath. Regular exfoliation with AHA’s (Alpha Hydroxy Acids) like </span><span>Klmklin AHA Face Wash Gel </span><span>OR BHA’s (Beta Hydroxy Acids) like </span><span>Bioderma Sebium Global </span><span>can help you to attain a smoother and glowing skin. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>ALOE VERA:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Aloe Vera gel is regarded as an elixir. It has skin soothing properties that reduce inflammation and redness, along with exhibiting antimicrobial properties. It intensely moisturises and nourishes the skin.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>AHA’s/ BHA’s AND ALOE VERA:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Combining these two products can prove to be a wonderful synergistic combination. AHA’s and BHA’s aid in exfoliation, but can cause irritation and redness in some. Layering the skin with aloe vera gel can help in achieving soothness and calmness to the skin.</span></p>
<h2><b>How to Incorporate Skincare Combinations into Your Routine?<br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="How to Incorporate Skincare Combinations into Your Routine?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_4_-_2024-01-04T134605.954_480x480.png?v=1704356180"/></div>
<p><span>While incorporating skincare combinations into your routine, start with understanding your skin type and do extensive research on what ingredients suit you and do not suit you. Then, take it slow. Don’t just jump into the well. Instead, take baby steps by incorporating less quantity for fewer days, and then gradually increasing the amount and frequency. Don’t expect to see the results in the initial weeks only. Be consistent and regular in your skincare practices to see the result.</span></p>

<p><span>Always keep in mind the below mentioned points while creating your unique skincare cocktail.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Understand your skin type.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Analyse your skin concern.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Avoid starting with higher concentrations. Use a lower one initially and then gradually increase it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Do not use harsh products if you have sensitive skin that is prone to dryness.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Dos and Don'ts of Mixing Skincare Products</strong></h3>
<p><span>Avoid the following skincare duos to prevent any skin disaster:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Do not mix 2 exfoliators. Avoid using retinoids, if you use salicylic acid serum. It can cause your skin to peel. Instead use a gentle cleanser such as </span><span>Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser</span><span> before using retinols.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Avoid mixing Vitamin C products with harsh acids as it can cause burning sensation along with redness.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Avoid using niacinamide or harsh acid with benzoyl peroxide and retinoids.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>If you are pregnant or nursing or are taking some medication, always</span><span> consult a dermatologist</span><span> before using any skincare product. </span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>How to Monitor Skin's Response to Combinations</strong></h3>
<p><span>Lastly, but not the least, always monitor the response of your skin to the skincare products. If any redness or peeling is noticed, immediately stop using it and consult a doctor. However, if you notice a positive response, and your concern vanishes, do not stop using the product suddenly. Taper down its application gradually.</span></p>
<p><span>To sum up, skincare products can make or break your appearance. So always use them wisely. In case of any doubt or apprehension, feel free to </span><span>consult a dermatologist </span><span>at </span><span>Clinikally</span><span>.</span></p>
