Frizzy hair can be a frustrating problem to deal with, leaving you feeling like you're constantly battling an unruly mess on your head. Whether you have naturally curly hair or just struggle with occasional frizz, finding effective solutions to tame those wild strands can be a challenge. In this blog post, we'll explore the causes of frizzy hair and share 10 of the best solutions how to get rid of frizzy hair, including both professional treatments and home remedies.
What Causes Frizzy Hair?
Frizzy hair is caused by a variety of factors, including:
Humidity
:
Humidity
is one of the main culprits behind frizzy hair. When the air is humid, it contains a lot of moisture, which can penetrate the hair shaft and cause it to swell. This leads to the hair becoming
frizzy and difficult
to manage. The excess moisture in the air can also make styling products less effective, leaving the hair looking limp and lifeless. To combat humidity-induced frizz, it's important to use products that are specifically designed to control frizz and protect the hair from moisture.
Dryness
: Hair that is dry and dehydrated is more prone to frizz. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as using harsh hair products, frequent heat styling, or exposure to
environmental factors
like the sun and wind. When the hair is dry, the cuticle (outer layer of the hair) becomes rough and raised, which allows moisture to penetrate the hair shaft and cause it to swell. To prevent
dryness
-induced frizz, it's important to use gentle hair products that don't contain harsh chemicals, avoid excessive heat styling, and protect the hair from environmental factors with a hat or scarf.
Damage
: Hair that is damaged or weakened is more likely to become frizzy. This can be caused by chemical treatments, like colouring or relaxing, or by using hot tools like flat irons and curling wands. When the hair is damaged, the cuticle becomes rough and uneven, which allows moisture to penetrate the hair shaft and cause it to swell. To prevent damage-induced frizz, it's important to limit the use of chemical treatments and heat styling tools and to use products that nourish and protect the hair.
Genetics
: Some people are simply more prone to frizzy hair due to their genetics. The shape and texture of the hair are determined by genetics, so if someone has naturally curly or wavy hair, they are more likely to experience frizz. While there's not much that can be done to change genetics, there are still ways to manage frizz and make the hair more manageable. Using the right products and styling techniques can go a long way in controlling frizz, regardless of the hair's natural texture.
By understanding the causes of frizzy hair, you can take steps to prevent it and keep your hair looking smooth and healthy. The next section will discuss some effective solutions for taming frizz and achieving smoother, more manageable hair.
Frizzy Hair Treatment
If you're dealing with frizzy hair, there are several different treatments and products that can help. Here are some of the most effective solutions for taming frizz and achieving smoother, more manageable hair:
Frizzy Hair Products
Anti-Frizz Shampoo and Conditioner
: Look for products that are specifically designed to
fight frizz
and add moisture to the hair. These products contain ingredients like
glycerin
and silicone, which can help to smooth the hair cuticle and reduce frizz.
Hair Oil
: Apply a few drops of hair oil, such as
argan oil
or
coconut oil
, to the ends of your hair to help smooth and hydrate the hair.
Smoothing Serum
: A smoothing serum can be applied to wet or dry hair to help tame frizz and add shine.
Leave-In Conditioner
: A leave-in conditioner can help to hydrate and
nourish the hair
, while also providing protection from environmental factors that can cause frizz.
Hair Masks
: A
hair mask
once a week can help deep condition and hydrate the hair, reducing frizz and leaving it feeling soft and silky.
By incorporating these frizzy hair products into your
hair care
routine, you can help to keep frizz at bay and achieve smoother, more manageable hair. In the next section, we'll discuss some other effective frizzy hair treatments, including at-home remedies and salon treatments.
Professional Treatments for Frizzy Hair
If you have frizzy hair that is difficult to manage, there are several professional treatments available to help smooth and tame it. Here are some common professional treatments for frizzy hair:
Keratin Treatment
:
Keratin treatments
are one of the most popular and effective methods for reducing frizz and improving hair texture. A keratin treatment involves the stylist applying a keratin-based solution to the hair, which is then sealed in with heat. This process smoothes the hair cuticle, reduces frizz, and improves shine. Depending on the treatment and your hair care routine, the results can last from a few weeks to months.
Brazilian Blowout
: Similar to keratin treatments, Brazilian blowouts are intended to smooth and straighten frizzy hair. A Brazilian blowout involves a stylist applying a specially formulated solution to the hair, which is then blow-dried and flat-ironed to seal the treatment in. Brazilian blowouts can help to reduce frizz, increase shine, and improve manageability. Results usually last for a few weeks or months.
Chemical Hair Straightening
: Chemical hair straightening treatments, like Japanese straightening or thermal reconditioning, permanently alter the structure of the hair, giving it a straighter, smoother appearance. These treatments involve applying a chemical solution to the hair, which dissolves the bonds that give it its natural texture. The hair is then straightened with heat and neutralised to keep the new shape. Chemical straightening treatments can produce long-term results, but they require frequent touch-ups as new hair grows in.
Deep Conditioning Treatments
: Deep conditioning treatments, which provide intense hydration and nourishment to frizzy hair, can help improve its overall health and appearance. These treatments typically include applying a rich conditioning mask or treatment to the hair and leaving it on for an extended period of time to allow it to penetrate the hair shaft and replenish moisture. Deep conditioning treatments can help reduce frizz, soften hair, and make it more manageable.
Anti-Frizz Serums and Treatments
: Many salons provide professional anti-frizz serums and treatments that are designed to smooth and control frizzy hair. These treatments typically include silicone, argan oil, or keratin, which help to coat the hair shaft and achieve a smooth, sleek finish. Anti-frizz serums and treatments can be applied in the salon or purchased for home use.
Before beginning any professional treatment for frizzy hair, consult with a stylist or
hair care professional
to determine which option is best for your hair type and condition. They can examine your hair and recommend a treatment that will help you achieve your goals while preserving the health and integrity of your hair.
Daily Habits to Prevent Frizz
The key to preventing frizz is to keep your hair moisturised and manage its natural texture. Here are some daily habits to help keep the frizz at bay:
Use a Gentle Shampoo
: To cleanse your hair without stripping it of natural oils, use a sulfate-free, moisturising
shampoo
. Overly harsh shampoos can lead to dryness and frizz.
Condition Every Time You Wash
: Follow your shampoo with a hydrating
conditioner
. Concentrate conditioner on your hair's mid-lengths and ends, which are the driest areas.
Rinse with Cool Water
: After conditioning, wash your hair with cool water. This helps to close the hair cuticle, retaining moisture and reducing frizz.
Blot Dry with a Microfiber Towel
: Instead of vigorously rubbing your hair with a towel, gently blot it to remove excess moisture. Rubbing can roughen the hair cuticle, contributing to frizz.
Apply a Leave-In Conditioner or Serum
: After towel-drying your hair, use a leave-in conditioner or smoothing serum to seal in moisture and protect against frizz. Concentrate on the ends of your hair, where frizz is most noticeable.
Detangle with a Wide-Tooth Comb
: Gently detangle your hair, beginning at the ends and working your way up to the roots. This helps to reduce breakage and prevent frizz.
Air Dry Whenever Possible
: Instead of using heat styling tools, allow your hair to air dry naturally. If you need to use a blow dryer, use a diffuser attachment on a low heat setting to reduce frizz.
Protect Your Hair While Sleeping
: Sleeping on a silk or satin pillowcase will reduce friction and frizz. You can also protect your hair by wearing a silk or satin sleep cap or wrapping it in a silk scarf.
Avoid Over-Brushing
: Brushing your hair too often can cause breakage and frizz. Instead, gently finger-comb your hair throughout the day to remove any tangles or knots.
Hydrate from Within
: Drink plenty of water and eat a nutritious diet to keep your hair healthy and hydrated from the inside out.
By incorporating these daily habits into your hair care routine, you can help control frizz and have smoother, more manageable hair.
Home Remedies for Frizzy Hair
If you prefer natural and DIY solutions, there are several home remedies that can help tame frizz and leave your hair looking smooth and healthy:
Apple Cider Vinegar Rinse
: Mix equal parts apple cider vinegar and water and use it to rinse your hair after shampooing. The vinegar’s acidity can help smooth the hair cuticle and reduce frizz.
Coconut Oil Mask
: Apply a few tablespoons of melted
coconut oil
to your hair and leave it on for 30 minutes before shampooing. Coconut oil can help to hydrate and nourish the hair, reducing frizz and leaving it feeling soft and silky.
Aloe Vera Gel
: Apply a small amount of
aloe vera
gel to your hair, and use a wide-toothed comb to distribute it evenly.
Aloe vera
can help to hydrate and smooth the hair, reducing frizz and adding shine.
Avocado Mask
: Mash half an avocado and mix it with a tablespoon of honey. Apply the mixture to your hair and leave it on for 20-30 minutes before shampooing.
Avocado
is rich in vitamins and fatty acids, which can help to nourish and hydrate the hair, reducing frizz and leaving it feeling soft and silky.
Egg Mask
: Beat an egg and mix it with a tablespoon of olive oil. Apply the mixture to your hair, and leave it on for 20-30 minutes before shampooing. Eggs are rich in protein, which can help to strengthen and smooth the hair, reducing frizz and adding shine.
By incorporating these home remedies into your hair care routine, you can help to reduce frizz and achieve smoother healthier hair. However, if your frizzy hair is severe or persistent, you may want to consider a salon treatment or
consult with a hair care professional
.
Natural Oils for Frizz Control
Natural oils can be extremely effective at reducing frizz and adding moisture to your hair. Here are some of the most effective natural oils for frizz control:
Argan Oil
: Argan oil contains antioxidants, vitamins, and fatty acids, which nourish and moisturise the hair. It quickly absorbs into the hair shaft, making it soft, smooth, and frizz-free. Argan oil also protects hair from heat damage and environmental stressors.
Coconut Oil
: Coconut oil is well-known for its capacity to enter the hair shaft and for its deep conditioning effects. It lessens frizz and stops breakage by strengthening and moisturising the hair. In addition to adding shine, coconut oil enhances the general condition of the hair.
Jojoba Oil
:
Jojoba oil
is a great option for moisturising hair without adding weight because it closely resembles the natural oils produced by the scalp. It improves sheen, lessens frizz, and smoothes the cuticle of hair. Jojoba oil absorbs easily into hair and is likewise non-greasy.
Sweet Almond Oil
: Sweet
almond oil
adds shine to hair and is perfect for controlling frizz because it is lightweight and easily absorbed. Its fatty acid and vitamin content helps to strengthen and nourish hair, leaving it silky, manageable, and soft.
Olive Oil
: Olive oil helps hydrate and condition hair because it is a rich source of vitamins and antioxidants. It enhances elasticity, lessens frizz, and smoothes the hair cuticle. Olive oil also gives hair lustre and softness, which facilitates styling.
Avocado Oil
: Rich in nutrients and lipids, avocado oil is perfect for dry, frizzy hair. It has fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals that strengthen and moisturise hair, minimising frizz and encouraging good development. Avocado oil also protects the hair against environmental damage.
Grapeseed Oil
: Grapeseed oil is lightweight and non-greasy, making it ideal for controlling frizz and adding shine to hair. It helps to seal the hair cuticle, reduce frizz, and prevent moisture loss. Grapeseed oil also contains antioxidants, which help protect the hair from damage.
To use natural oils for frizz control, apply a small amount to damp or dry hair, concentrating on the mid-lengths and ends. They can be used as a leave-in treatment, a hair mask, or a styling product. Experiment with different oils to determine which ones work best for your hair type and texture.

Hydration Tips for Frizzy Hair
Hydration is essential for reducing frizz and maintaining smooth, healthy-looking hair. Here are some hydration tips designed specifically for frizzy hair:
Choose a sulfate-free shampoo and hydrating conditioner designed specifically for dry or frizzy hair. Look for products that contain glycerin, coconut oil,
shea butter
, or argan oil, which all help to moisturise and nourish the hair.
Incorporate a deep conditioning treatment into your hair care routine at least once a week. Choose a rich, moisturizing hair mask or treatment and leave it on for the recommended time to hydrate and nourish your hair deeply.
After washing and conditioning your hair, add a leave-in conditioner or hydrating serum to the damp hair. These products help to keep moisture in the hair, smooth the cuticle, and prevent frizz throughout the day.
Apply a few drops of hydrating hair oil, such as argan, coconut, or jojoba oil, to your hair's mid-lengths and ends. These oils help to retain moisture, add shine, and protect from environmental damage.
Heat styling tools such as blow dryers, flat irons, and curling irons should be used with caution because they can dehydrate hair and cause frizz. If you do use heat styling tools, apply a heat protectant spray or serum to minimise damage.
UV rays from the sun can dry and damage hair, causing frizz and breakage. When spending extended periods outside, wear a hat or use UV-protectant hair spray to protect your hair from the sun's damaging effects.
Washing your hair too frequently can strip away its natural oils, resulting in dryness and frizz. Try to wash your hair no more than 2-3 times a week, and use a dry shampoo in between washes to absorb excess oil and refresh your hair.
Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your body hydrated from within. Hydration is critical for proper hair growth and overall hair health.
Cotton pillowcases can absorb moisture from your hair, resulting in dryness and frizz. Switch to silk or satin pillowcases to reduce friction and help your hair retain moisture while sleeping.
By incorporating these hydration tips into your daily hair care routine, you can keep your frizzy hair hydrated, smooth, and manageable.
Styling Tips for Frizzy Hair
Styling frizzy hair can be difficult, but with the right tools and products, you can achieve smooth, polished results. Here are some styling tips to manage frizzy hair:
Begin with a Good Haircut
: A well-cut haircut can make a significant difference in managing frizz. Choose a haircut that suits your hair texture and face shape. Layers can help to reduce bulk and weight in the hair, whereas a blunt cut can control frizz and add definition.
Use a Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner
: Begin your styling routine with a smoothing shampoo and conditioner that will tame frizz and moisturise your hair. Look for products that include hydrating ingredients such as argan oil, shea butter, and keratin.
Apply a Frizz-Control Serum or Cream
: After washing and conditioning your hair, use a frizz-control serum or cream to dampen hair. Focus on the mid-lengths and ends, where frizz tends to be most noticeable. These products help to smooth the hair cuticle and prevent frizz throughout the day.
Blow Dry with a Diffuser
: If you prefer to blow dry your hair, use a diffuser attachment to reduce frizz and enhance the natural texture. Begin by applying a heat protectant spray or serum to damp hair, then use a diffuser on low heat to gently dry it while scrunching it with your fingers.
Air Dry with Twist or Braid
: Allowing your hair to air dry can help reduce frizz, particularly if you have curly or wavy hair. To enhance your natural texture and reduce frizz, twist or braid your damp hair and let it air dry. Once dry, gently unravel the twists or braids to create soft, defined waves.
Use a Wide-Tooth Comb or Detangling Brush
: When styling your hair, use a wide-tooth comb or detangling brush to gently work through knots and tangles. Brushing your hair while it is dry can cause breakage and frizz.
Avoid Over-Brushing
: Brushing your hair too frequently can damage the cuticle and cause frizz. Instead, brush your hair only when it is wet, and gently detangle it with a wide-tooth comb or detangling brush.
Invest in Quality Styling Tools
: Having high-quality styling tools can help you manage frizz effectively. Look for flat and curling irons that are ceramic or tourmaline-coated to help seal the hair cuticle and reduce frizz. To prevent damage from heat styling tools, use a heat protectant spray or serum first.
Finish with a Light Hold Hairspray
: After styling your hair, apply a Light Hold hairspray to help set the style and control frizz throughout the day. Choose a lightweight formula that will not weigh down your hair or make it sticky.
By incorporating these styling tips into your hair care routine, you can reduce frizz and achieve smooth, polished looks that highlight your natural texture.
Choosing the Right Hair Tools
Choosing the right hair tools is critical to achieving your desired hairstyle while minimising damage and frizz. Here are some factors to consider when choosing hair tools:
Consider your hair type and texture when selecting hair tools. For example, if your hair is thick or curly, you may require a more powerful blow dryer or flat iron to properly style it. If you have fine or thin hair, you should use gentler tools that will not cause breakage or damage.
Look for hair tools with adjustable heat settings so you can tailor the temperature to your hair type and styling requirements. Lower heat settings work best for fine or damaged hair, while higher heat settings may be required for thick or coarse hair.
Pay attention to the materials used in hair tools, as they can affect their performance and the health of your hair. Ceramic and tourmaline-coated tools help distribute heat evenly and reduce frizz by sealing the hair cuticle. Titanium tools are lightweight and heat up quickly, making them ideal for thick or coarse hair types. Avoid using metal or plastic tools, as they can cause hot spots and damage to the hair.
Determine the size and shape of the hair tools based on your styling preferences and hair length. For example, smaller flat irons and curling irons are best for short hair or tight curls, whereas larger barrels are better for long hair or loose waves.
Look for hair tools that use advanced technology to protect your hair from damage. For example, ionic technology reduces static and frizz, infrared heat technology penetrates the hair shaft more deeply, and steam technology moisturises the hair while styling.
Consider the ergonomics and usability of the hair tools, particularly if you intend to use them frequently. To make styling more enjoyable, look for lightweight tools with comfortable handles and intuitive controls.
Investigate various brands and read user reviews to get a sense of the quality and performance of the hair tools. Choose reputable brands known for their cutting-edge technology and hair-friendly formulations.
Determine your budget and prioritise features according to your needs and preferences. While high-quality hair tools may be more expensive at first, they typically last longer and produce better results, saving you money in the long run.
By taking these factors into account and selecting hair tools that are appropriate for your hair type and styling needs, you can achieve beautiful, healthy-looking hair without causing damage or frizz.
Techniques for Drying Frizzy Hair
Drying frizzy hair can be a delicate process to avoid exacerbating frizz and keeping it smooth. Here are some ways to dry frizzy hair effectively:
Instead of rubbing your hair vigorously with a regular towel, which can cause friction and frizz, use a microfiber towel or a soft cotton T-shirt to gently blot excess water away. Patting your hair dry with these materials helps to absorb moisture without roughening the hair cuticle.
Before drying, apply a leave-in conditioner or frizz-control serum to damp hair. These products help to seal in moisture, smooth the hair cuticle, and prevent frizz as it dries.
To detangle your hair without causing breakage or frizz, use a wide-tooth comb or a detangling brush. Begin with the ends of your hair and work your way up to the roots, gently removing knots and tangles.
If you prefer to blow dry your hair, use a diffuser attachment to reduce frizz and enhance the natural texture. Set your blow dryer to a low or medium heat setting and hold the diffuser close to your hair, moving it in a circular motion to dry your hair evenly.
Allow your hair to air dry whenever possible to avoid heat damage and frizz. If you are air drying your hair, do not touch or tousle it too much because it can disrupt the cuticle and cause frizz.
Dividing your hair into sections before drying will ensure even drying and reduce frizz. Clip or tie your hair's top layers, and then focus on drying the bottom layers first. Once the bottom layers have dried, remove the top layers and dry them separately.
After blow drying your hair, use a cool shot of air from your blow dryer to help set your style and close the hair cuticle, reducing frizz and increasing shine.
Overdrying your hair can remove moisture and cause frizz. Dry your hair until it is approximately 80% dry, then allow the remaining moisture to air dry naturally. This promotes hydration and prevents frizz.
By gently and effectively drying your frizzy hair, you can reduce frizz and achieve smoother, more manageable locks.
Takeaway: Reduce Frizz in Wavy Hair!
If you have wavy hair, you may be more prone to frizz than those with straight hair. However, there are several steps you can take to reduce frizz and keep your waves looking smooth and defined:
Use a wide-toothed comb or your fingers to detangle your hair, starting from the ends and working your way up. Avoid using a brush, which can cause
breakage
and frizz.
Avoid rubbing your hair with a towel after washing it. Instead, gently squeeze out excess water and use a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt to blot your hair dry.
Apply a leave-in conditioner or styling product to your hair while it's still damp, using your fingers to distribute it evenly.
Avoid using hot tools like blow dryers and flat irons, which can cause damage and frizz. Instead, let your hair air-dry or use a diffuser attachment on a low heat setting.
Sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase, which can help to reduce friction and prevent frizz.
By following these tips and incorporating frizz-fighting products into your hair care routine, you can keep your wavy hair looking smooth and defined. Remember to be gentle with your hair, avoid over-washing and heat styling, and protect it from environmental factors like humidity and sun exposure. With a little patience and care, you can achieve beautiful, frizz-free waves!
