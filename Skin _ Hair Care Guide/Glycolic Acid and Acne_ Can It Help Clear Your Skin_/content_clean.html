While some people may notice a noticeable improvement in their acne, others may notice more minor changes. In order to prevent any irritation or over-exfoliation, it's also crucial to use glycolic acid products correctly and gradually include them in your skincare routine. A dermatologist or other skincare expert should always be consulted if you're considering including glycolic acid in your regimen for treating acne. Based on your particular skin type, issues, and severity of acne, they can offer tailored counseling.</span></p>
<h2><b>How Glycolic Acid Works on Acne</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="glycolic acid acne treatment" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Symptoms_of_period_acne_e697e9b1-4c50-4ea5-9a9d-3082edc4e735_480x480.png?v=1685341638"/></b></p>
<p><span>Glycolic acid treats acne by exfoliating the skin, unclogging blocked pores, and promoting skin renewal. The precise mechanism by which glycolic acid treats acne is described below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Exfoliation</b><span>: A chemical exfoliant called glycolic acid aids in removing the top layer of dead skin cells from the skin's surface. This exfoliation procedure aids in preventing the accumulation of debris, oil, and dead skin cells that can <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/open-clogged-pores">clog pores</a> and contribute to the development of acne.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Unclogging pores</b><span>: One of the main contributors to the emergence of acne is clogged pores. Glycolic acid has the ability to penetrate the skin while also dissolving the bonds that bind clogged pores, surplus oil, and dead skin cells together. By unclogging pores, glycolic acid reduces the likelihood of <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/decoding-acne-purge-vs-breakout">acne breakouts</a> and assists in preventing the growth of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads).</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skin renewal and cell turnover</b><span>: Glycolic acid stimulates skin cell turnover, which refers to the process of shedding old skin cells and replacing them with new ones. Glycolic acid promotes cell turnover, which helps to renew the skin, improve its texture, and reduce the appearance of acne scars and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Anti-inflammatory</b><span>: Glycolic acid has anti-inflammatory properties that can help calm and lessen acne-related redness. Acne-related redness and swelling can be controlled with the aid of glycolic acid, which calms the skin and reduces inflammation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Improved penetration of additional acne-fighting agents</b><span>: When used in conjunction with other acne-fighting agents like <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/a-z-guide-on-benefits-of-using-a-salicylic-acid-face-wash">salicylic acid</a> or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/is-benzoyl-peroxide-good-for-acne">benzoyl peroxide</a>, glycolic acid's exfoliating action also improves the penetration of those agents. This combination of ingredients may boost their ability to target acne-causing bacteria and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/acne-acne-scars">reduce inflammation</a>.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Although glycolic acid can be useful for treating acne, not everyone will have the same effects, and individual outcomes may differ. To prevent potential skin irritation or over-exfoliation, it's also important to use glycolic acid products as indicated, start with lesser doses, and gradually increase usage. It is advised to speak with a dermatologist or other skincare expert before using glycolic acid for acne. Based on your skin type and the severity of your acne, they can assess your particular skin issues, offer personalized advice, and propose an acceptable concentration and frequency of use.</span></p>
<h3><b>Exfoliation and Acne Prevention</b></h3>
<p><span>By removing dead skin cells, clearing clogged pores, and creating a smoother, clearer complexion, exfoliation is essential for acne prevention. Exfoliation aids in acne prevention in the following ways:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Removal of dead skin cells</b><span>: Dead skin cells may build up on the skin's surface, where they may mix with sebum and clog pores. This accumulation can cause comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) to form and aid in the emergence of acne. These dead skin cells are removed through exfoliation, preventing them from accumulating and obstructing pores.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Pore unclogging</b><span>: Exfoliation, especially when using chemical exfoliants like salicylic acid or glycolic acid, can get inside the pores and dissolve the extra oil, dirt, and dead skin cells that clog them. Exfoliation helps to lessen the frequency of acne breakouts by effectively clearing the pores.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Enhanced ingredient penetration for acne treatments</b><span>: Exfoliation leaves the skin with a clear surface so that other acne-fighting ingredients can better penetrate it. Topical retinoids or benzoyl peroxide can target acne-causing bacteria, reduce inflammation, and promote a clearer complexion more effectively after exfoliation by penetrating the skin's deeper layers.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Smoother skin texture</b><span>: Exfoliation promotes skin cell renewal, exposing younger-looking skin. Exfoliation can lessen the visibility of acne scars and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation by enhancing the skin's texture, giving the skin a more even tone.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>The right amount of exfoliation is crucial, though, as excessive exfoliation or the use of abrasive exfoliants can upset the skin's natural balance and cause irritation. The following advice will help you exfoliate safely and effectively:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Select the appropriate exfoliant</b><span>: Look for exfoliants designed especially for skin types with acne or sensitivity. Acne treatment with chemical exfoliants like salicylic acid or glycolic acid is frequently tolerated and productive.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Start gradually</b><span>: Start with a lower concentration or frequency if you're new to exfoliation or using a new product to give your skin time to acclimate. The concentration or frequency should then be gradually increased as your skin becomes more used to it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Obey the guidance</b><span>: To ensure secure and appropriate use, always adhere to the exfoliating product's instructions. Pay attention to the application's recommended usage time and frequency.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Check-in with your skin</b><span>: Keep an eye on how exfoliation affects your skin. Reduce the frequency or intensity of exfoliation if you notice excessive dryness, redness, or irritation. Finding a balance that benefits your skin is crucial.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Protect and moisturize</b><span>: After exfoliating, be sure to rehydrate your skin by applying a suitable moisturizer. In addition, use sunscreen every day to guard against potential sun sensitivity after exfoliation.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>By maintaining clear skin, unclogging pores, and fostering a smoother complexion, regular and mild exfoliation can aid in the prevention of acne. To avoid any irritation or over-exfoliation, it's crucial to customize your exfoliation program to your unique skin type and issues. It is advised to see a dermatologist for individualized guidance and treatment options if you have severe or persistent acne.</span></p>
<h3><b>Glycolic Acid for Post-Acne Scarring</b></h3>
<p><span>The appearance of post-acne scarring can be improved with glycolic acid. The benefits are as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Skin exfoliation and cell turnover</b><span>: Glycolic acid is an <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/aha-vs-bha-in-your-skincare-routine">alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) </a>that exfoliates the skin. By removing the top layer of dead skin cells, glycolic acid encourages skin cell turnover, exposing younger-looking skin beneath. As the younger skin cells gradually replace the damaged ones, this process can help post-acne scars fade over time.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Collagen synthesis</b><span>: Glycolic acid encourages the skin's natural synthesis of collagen. The protein collagen contributes to the elasticity and structure of the skin. Glycolic acid helps to increase the production of collagen, which helps to improve the firmness and texture of the skin and lessen the visibility of some acne scarring types, such as shallow or indented scars.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reduce hyperpigmentation</b><span>: Hyperpigmentation, or an overproduction of melanin in the skin, is frequently present along with post-acne scars. By preventing the production of melanin and fostering a more even skin tone, glycolic acid has brightening properties and can aid in the fading of hyperpigmentation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Smoother skin</b><span>: Glycolic acid can improve the skin's overall refinement and smoothness. This can lessen the appearance of skin that is uneven due to post-acne scarring.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>When utilizing glycolic acid to treat <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/how-to-incorporate-glycolic-acid-into-your-skincare-routine">post-acne scarring</a>, it's vital to keep in mind that varied results may be obtained based on the type and degree of the scars. In order to prevent potential skin irritation or over-exfoliation, glycolic acid should be applied carefully and with caution. Here are a few advice:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Start with a lower concentration of glycolic acid (around 5% or 7%), especially if you have sensitive skin or are new to using it, and then gradually increase it as your skin tolerates it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Always abide by the glycolic acid product's instructions. Pay attention to the application's recommended usage time and frequency.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays because post-acne scars are frequently more vulnerable to skin cancer. Use sunscreen every day with a high SPF to shield your skin from damaging UV rays. When using glycolic acid, sun protection is especially crucial because it can make users more sensitive to the sun's rays.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>It takes time and consistent application of glycolic acid to lessen the visibility of post-acne scars. It might take several weeks or months of consistent use to notice changes. Maintain your skincare regimen with patience and consistency.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>It is best to see a dermatologist if you have severe scarring, deep indentations, or raised scars. They can offer individualized advice and might also recommend additional therapies, like laser therapy or chemical peels, for scarring that is more severe.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>It's important to note that milder post-acne scarring, like hyperpigmentation or shallow indentations, may respond better to glycolic acid. It might be necessary to use a combination of treatments or more involved procedures for scarring that is more severe. Your dermatologist can help you choose the best course of action for your unique scarring concerns.</span></p>

<h3><b>Salicylic Acid and Glycolic Acid: A Dynamic Duo</b></h3>
<p><span>Both salicylic acid and glycolic acid are effective treatments for acne and for enhancing the texture of the skin. They can work as a dynamic pair to treat distinct areas of acne and promote clearer, smoother skin when taken in conjunction with one another. Here's how they operate and how to make good use of them:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Salicylic Acid</b><span>:</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) that penetrates the pores and aids in the exfoliation of the inside walls. It effectively dissolves oil and unclogs pores, thereby preventing acne formation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Salicylic acid has anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce the redness and inflammation associated with acne.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Salicylic acid's capacity to regulate excessive oil production and prevent pore blockages makes it especially advantageous for skin types that are oily and prone to acne.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><b>Glycolic Acid</b><span>:</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) that works on the skin's surface to exfoliate dead skin cells and encourage cell turnover. The appearance of acne scars and hyperpigmentation is diminished, skin tone is evened out, and skin texture is improved.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid can improve the absorption of other skincare ingredients, enabling them to reach deeper layers of the skin and produce better results.</span></p>
</li>
<li>

</ol>
<p><span>Here are some pointers for successfully combining glycolic acid and salicylic acid:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>To reduce the risk of irritation, it is best to start with products that have lower concentrations when combining these acids. Salicylic acid concentrations typically range from 0.5% to 2%, while glycolic acid concentrations for at-home use can be as high as 10%.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Use glycolic acid and salicylic acid alternately to prevent over-exfoliation and potential irritation. For instance, you could alternate using a toner or serum with glycolic acid one day and a cleanser or spot treatment with salicylic acid the next.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Always use products in accordance with the instructions that come with them. Pay close attention to the manufacturer's recommended usage guidelines and any warnings.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>If you choose to use both acids in the same routine, start with glycolic acid products since they work on the skin's surface and salicylic acid products since they penetrate the pores. The order of the layers ensures that each acid can function freely and without interference.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Before combining acids, introduce one at a time into your skincare routine. This allows your skin to adapt and reduces the likelihood of irritation. Begin by using each acid a few times per week, increasing the frequency as your skin tolerates it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Both salicylic acid and glycolic acid can make you more sensitive to the sun. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 to shield your skin from damaging UV rays during the day.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Keep an eye on skin's reaction: Watch your skin's reaction after applying both acids. Reduce your usage frequency or temporarily stop if you notice excessive dryness, redness, or irritation. Due to the variations in everyone's skin, modify your routine as necessary.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Always seek out individualized guidance and recommendations from a dermatologist if you have any worries or inquiries.</span></p>

<h2><b>When to See a Dermatologist</b></h2>
<p><span>Even though many skincare problems can be treated at home with over-the-counter products and self-care methods, there are some situations where seeing a dermatologist is advised. Here are some circumstances where it makes sense to get a dermatologist's professional judgment:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Acne that is persistent or severe</b><span>: It is best to see a dermatologist if your acne is causing significant physical or emotional distress or does not respond to over-the-counter treatments. They can assess the type and severity of your particular acne and suggest the best prescription medications or treatments to help your skin clear up.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Chronic skin conditions</b><span>: If you have a chronic skin condition like eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, or dermatitis that is not adequately controlled by over-the-counter medications, a dermatologist can make a proper diagnosis and develop a personalized treatment plan for you.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Suspected skin cancer</b><span>: If you see any moles, growths, or changes in your skin that might be skin cancer, it's crucial to see a dermatologist right away. They are able to conduct a thorough examination, offer an accurate diagnosis, and, if required, carry out a biopsy or suggest additional treatment.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Chronic skin infections</b><span>: If you have recurring or chronic skin infections like cellulitis, impetigo, or fungal infections, a dermatologist can help identify the underlying cause and offer the best course of action to stop further complications.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hair loss or scalp conditions</b><span>: A dermatologist with expertise in hair and scalp conditions can help you determine the underlying cause of your excessive hair loss, itching, or other scalp conditions like dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis and recommend suitable treatments or lifestyle changes.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Concerns about skin pigmentation</b><span>: If you have concerns about uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation, or melasma that are not improving with over-the-counter products, a dermatologist can examine your condition and offer expert advice on treatment options, including prescription-strength whitening products or procedures like chemical peels or laser treatments.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cosmetic issues</b><span>: If you're interested in addressing specific cosmetic issues like wrinkles, fine lines, scarring, or age spots, a dermatologist can provide you with a variety of treatments like injectables, laser therapy, or other cosmetic procedures to help you achieve your aesthetic objectives.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Allergies or severe skin irritations</b><span>: If you experience an allergic reaction that is severe enough to cause hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing, or if a product or treatment has caused a severe skin rash or burn, you should seek immediate medical attention. A dermatologist can conduct a prompt examination and administer the proper treatment to prevent further complications. </span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>If you have any concerns about your skin, hair, or nails that are not getting better or are causing you a lot of grief, it is always a good idea to see a dermatologist. They may offer personalized advice based on your particular requirements and objectives and have the knowledge to diagnose and treat a variety of skin diseases.</span></p>
