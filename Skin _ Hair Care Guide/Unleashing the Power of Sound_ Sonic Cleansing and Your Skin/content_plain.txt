The Do's and Don'ts of Ultrasonic Exfoliation: Safeguarding Your Skin
Ultrasonic exfoliation can be a highly effective skincare technique when done correctly, but it's essential to follow the do's and don'ts to safeguard your skin. The following advice will help you use ultrasonic exfoliation safely:
Do's:
Before using an ultrasonic exfoliation device, start with clean, dry skin.  Cleaning ensures better exfoliation results by removing makeup, oil, and dirt.
The skin should first be treated with a water-based exfoliating gel or serum before using the ultrasonic device. Water-based products give ultrasonic waves the conductivity they need to successfully penetrate skin.
Move the ultrasonic exfoliation tool slowly and gently over the skin's surface when using it. To avoid causing irritability or discomfort, try not to move too quickly or apply too much pressure.
Focus on exfoliating the areas of skin that need it most—the cheeks, chin, forehead, and nose. Spend more time on areas with rough texture, congestion, or an uneven tone.
Drink plenty of water before and after ultrasonic exfoliation to keep your skin hydrated and aid in the removal of toxins.  Hydration is essential for skin health and cell regeneration.
Following exfoliation, use a hydrating moisturiser to replenish moisture and nourish the skin.  Moisturising helps to restore the skin's barrier function, preventing dryness and irritation.
Clean your ultrasonic exfoliation device after each use to get rid of any product residue or buildup.  Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper maintenance to ensure the device remains hygienic and in good working condition.
Don'ts
:
Avoid using ultrasonic exfoliation over active acne lesions, open wounds, or areas of irritated or inflamed skin. Exfoliating these areas can worsen inflammation and delay healing.
Limit ultrasonic exfoliation to once or twice a week to avoid over-exfoliation, which can lead to skin sensitivity, redness, or irritation. Listen to your skin's needs and adjust the frequency of exfoliation accordingly.
Avoid using the ultrasonic exfoliation device on sensitive areas of the skin, such as the delicate skin around the eyes or lips. These areas are more prone to irritation and may not tolerate the exfoliation process well.
Do not share your ultrasonic exfoliation device with others to prevent the spread of bacteria or other contaminants. Keep your device for personal use only and clean it thoroughly after each use.
Refrain from using ultrasonic exfoliation on sunburned or recently sun-exposed skin. Exfoliating sunburned skin can exacerbate irritation and increase the risk of further damage.
Pay attention to how your skin reacts during and after ultrasonic exfoliation. If you experience any redness, burning, itching, or other adverse reactions, discontinue use immediately and consult a
dermatologist
if necessary.

ceramides
,
niacinamide
, or peptides to help support the skin barrier and improve overall skin health.
Sunscreen
: During the daytime, always finish your skincare routine with a broad-spectrum sunscreen to protect your skin from sun damage and premature aging. Opt for a lightweight, non-greasy sunscreen that won't interfere with the efficacy of your sonic skincare products.
Patch Test New Products
: Before using a new skincare product with your sonic device, perform a patch test on a small area of skin to check for any adverse reactions or sensitivities. If you experience any redness, itching, or irritation, discontinue use of the product and consult a dermatologist if necessary.
