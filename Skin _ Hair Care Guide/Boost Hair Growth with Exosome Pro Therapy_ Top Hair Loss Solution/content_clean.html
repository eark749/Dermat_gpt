<p><span>Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles that are released into body fluids following the fusion of multivesicular bodies and the plasma membrane. Its size varies from 30-150 nanometers. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can be secreted by various cells and are responsible for cell-cell interaction.</span></p>

<p><span>This therapy uses exosomes, which are extracellular vesicles generated from stem cells. They play an important role in cell communication, which is helpful in hair regeneration.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Exosomes can encourage dormant hair follicles, which results in increased hair density.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Exosomes' anti-inflammatory properties contribute to a healthier scalp environment, which is essential for <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hair-regrow-serum%20">hair growth</a>.</span></p>

<p><span>Exosomes then go to other cells and offer instructions to help heal the damage. After exosomes are injected into the wounded region, the healing process is divided into two stages. Firstly, it will reduce inflammation, secondly, it will teach the cells how to react in the future.</span></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Cleanliness</b><span>: Keeping the scalp clean is important to remove dirt, excess oil, and product buildup, which can clog hair follicles and impede growth. Use a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo to avoid stripping the scalp's natural oils. Periodic scalp <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/exfoliation%20">exfoliation</a> removes dead skin cells and promotes cell turnover, keeping the scalp fresh and healthy. Use a mild scalp scraper or brush made specifically for this purpose.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydration and Moisture</b><span>: A <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/dry-scalp">dry scalp</a> can cause irritation and peeling, which can inhibit hair development. Use moisturizing shampoos and conditioners, or apply scalp serums that moisturize the scalp. Drinking plenty of water is also important since it promotes general skin and scalp health.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Balanced Sebum Production</b><span>: An overly <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/oily-scalp">oily scalp</a> can cause dandruff and plugged follicles. Use balancing shampoos to control sebum production, and avoid products that are too heavy or greasy. Regular scalp massages can help to evenly distribute natural oils, avoid buildup, and enhance circulation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Circulation and Stimulation</b><span>: Scalp massages not only feel wonderful, but they help increase blood circulation, ensuring that hair follicles receive the nutrients and oxygen they require for healthy growth.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Nutrient-Rich Diet</b><span>: A diet high in vitamins, minerals, and proteins promotes both scalp health and hair development. Eggs, almonds, spinach, and fish are great options. If your diet is lacking certain nutrients and supplements, such as biotin, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/collagen">collagen</a>, and omega-3 fatty acids, can help with scalp health.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Managing Scalp Conditions</b><span>: Dandruff can cause itchiness, irritation, and hair loss. Anti-dandruff shampoos with chemicals such as ketoconazole, zinc pyrithione, or salicylic acid can help control <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/dandruff">dandruff</a> and improve scalp health.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Harsh Chemicals and Heat</b><span>: Avoid <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/shampoos">shampoos</a> and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/conditioners">conditioners</a> with harsh chemicals like sulfates, parabens, etc., which can irritate your scalp.
