The vitamin B complex is made up of numerous key vitamins that are important for keeping healthy hair. This blog explains how each B vitamin contributes to hair health.
Understanding Vitamin B Complex
The vitamin B complex is a group of eight vitamins that all help with cell metabolism, which means they help your body produce energy to fuel itself. However, some of these eight B vitamins are also known to have hair-related advantages. While vitamins can be obtained through diet, some individuals prefer to take vitamin B supplements to ensure that they receive all of the benefits of the vitamin B complex.
What is Vitamin B Complex?
The vitamin B complex is a set of eight water-soluble vitamins that promote cell growth and metabolism. While a well-balanced and healthy diet can meet your daily requirements, we live in a time when fast and convenient meals may contain fewer vitamins than our bodies require. Supplementing with B vitamins ensures that we get thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), vitamin B6, biotin (B7), folate, and vitamin B12.

Tips for Maximizing the Benefits of Vitamin B Complex
Now that you have learned about the sources of various B vitamins and how much of them you should consume each day, consider these tips to help you get the most out of these nutrients::
Take them in the morning
:
If you have been wondering, "What time of day should I take vitamin B complex supplements?" this is the answer. As previously stated, vitamin B may help boost your energy levels, and you will certainly need more of it in the morning.
Consider taking them with food or a glass of water
:
While vitamin B complex supplements can be taken on an empty stomach, because they are water-soluble vitamins, they should be taken with a glass of water. Particularly if your formula contains vitamin B12, it will be better absorbed with a meal.
Do not take with a vitamin C (ascorbic acid) supplement
:
This is true if you are taking a vitamin B12 supplement or formula containing it. Taking supplements containing these two nutrients together may reduce the amount of vitamin B12 in your body. Take your vitamin B12 or vitamin B complex supplement first, then wait at least two hours before taking the
vitamin C
(ascorbic acid) supplement.
Ask your doctor about vitamin B complex supplements for you
:
It would not hurt to speak with your doctor or
dermatologists
about taking vitamin B complex supplements. They can help you learn more about their benefits, identify specific vitamins you may need based on your current health status, and determine whether you are deficient in certain nutrients.
