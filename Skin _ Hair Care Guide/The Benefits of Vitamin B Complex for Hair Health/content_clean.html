<p><span>Now that you have learned about the sources of various B vitamins and how much of them you should consume each day, consider these tips to help you get the most out of these nutrients::</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Take them in the morning</b><span>:</span> <span>If you have been wondering, "What time of day should I take vitamin B complex supplements?" this is the answer. As previously stated, vitamin B may help boost your energy levels, and you will certainly need more of it in the morning.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consider taking them with food or a glass of water</b><span>:</span> <span>While vitamin B complex supplements can be taken on an empty stomach, because they are water-soluble vitamins, they should be taken with a glass of water. Particularly if your formula contains vitamin B12, it will be better absorbed with a meal.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Do not take with a vitamin C (ascorbic acid) supplement</b><span>:</span> <span>This is true if you are taking a vitamin B12 supplement or formula containing it. Taking supplements containing these two nutrients together may reduce the amount of vitamin B12 in your body. Take your vitamin B12 or vitamin B complex supplement first, then wait at least two hours before taking the <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-vitamin-c3-serum">vitamin C</a> (ascorbic acid) supplement.</span><i><span> </span></i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Ask your doctor about vitamin B complex supplements for you</b><span>:</span> <span>It would not hurt to speak with your doctor or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">dermatologists</a> about taking vitamin B complex supplements. They can help you learn more about their benefits, identify specific vitamins you may need based on your current health status, and determine whether you are deficient in certain nutrients. </span></p>
</li>
</ul>
