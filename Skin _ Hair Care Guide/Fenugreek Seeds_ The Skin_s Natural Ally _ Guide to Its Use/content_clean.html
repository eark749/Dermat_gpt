<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Can I apply fenugreek seeds directly to my skin? </b><span>Yes, fenugreek seeds can be used on the skin. Soak the seeds overnight, then crush them into a paste to use as a mask. However, a patch test should be performed first to rule out any adverse responses.</span></p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Is fenugreek useful for acne? </b><span>Fenugreek has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial characteristics that may <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-nia-serum">help with acne management</a>.
