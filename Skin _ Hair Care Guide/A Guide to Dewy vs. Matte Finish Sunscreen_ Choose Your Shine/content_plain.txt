Selecting sunscreen is important because, in addition to protecting from UV rays, the sunscreen's finish can also affect how you look. Matte and dewy textures accommodate various skin tones and preferences. This blog serves as a decision-making guide for sunscreens with matte or dewy finishes.
Understanding Sunscreen Finishes: Dewy and Matte Explained
The appearance of your skin after applying sunscreen, whether dewy or matte, is referred to as its finish. Here's an explanation for each of these finishes.
Dewy finish, such as appearance, best skin types, ingredients, application, events, and considerations.
Matte finish characteristics include appearance, ideal skin types, ingredients, application, occasions, and considerations.
What Makes a Sunscreen Dewy or Matte?
The formulation and specific ingredients in a sunscreen primarily influence its finish, which can be dewy or matte. Here's what goes into each type of finish:
Dewy Finish Sunscreen:
Moisturizing Ingredients
:
Dewy finish sunscreens frequently include moisturising agents such as glycerin,
hyaluronic acid
, or natural oils (e.g., coconut oil, argan oil). These ingredients hydrate the skin, resulting in a plump and dewy appearance.
Light-Reflecting Particles
:
Some formulations contain light-reflecting particles or
pigments
, which produce a subtle sheen on the skin. These particles scatter light, enhancing the dewy finish's radiant and luminous appearance.
Emollients
: Emollient ingredients such as shea butter and specific fatty acids are commonly found in dewy finish sunscreens. Emollients contribute to a smooth and soft texture, which improves the overall feel and appearance of the skin.
Matte Finish Sunscreen
:
Oil-Absorbing Ingredients
: Oil-absorbing ingredients commonly found in matte-finish sunscreens include silica, kaolin clay, and dimethicone.  These ingredients help control excess oil production on the skin, leading to a matte appearance.
Powders
:
Some matte finish sunscreens incorporate finely milled powders, which contribute to a velvety texture and reduce shine. Powders can also aid in creating a smooth, matte surface on the skin.
Sebum-Controlling Agents
:
Formulations for matte finishes may include sebum-controlling agents that help regulate the skin's oil production. These agents contribute to a matte appearance by minimising excess oil.
Water-Based Formulas
: Matte finish sunscreens may contain a water-based formulation, which provides a lightweight feel without leaving a greasy residue on the skin.
It is worth noting that the difference between dewy and matte finishes is not always black and white, and some sunscreens may fall somewhere in the middle, providing a natural or satin finish. Furthermore, the specific combination and concentration of ingredients in each sunscreen product will influence its overall effect on the skin. When choosing a sunscreen, you should consider your skin type, preferences, and any specific concerns you may have, such as oiliness or dryness.
The Benefits of Dewy Finish Sunscreens
Dewy finish sunscreens provide several advantages, particularly for people with specific skin types or who want a radiant and luminous complexion. Here are some benefits of using dewy finish sunscreens.
Hydration Boost
:
Dewy finish sunscreens frequently include moisturising ingredients such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, or natural oils.  These ingredients help to hydrate the skin, so dewy finishes are ideal for people with dry or normal skin.
Radiant and Luminous Look
:
The dewy finish gives the skin a subtle, natural glow, resulting in a luminous appearance. It improves the overall radiance of the complexion, resulting in a healthy and vibrant appearance.
Enhanced Skin Texture
:
Moisturising agents and emollients in dewy finish sunscreens can help to create a smoother, softer skin texture.  The dewy effect can reduce the appearance of fine lines and uneven skin texture.
Natural and Fresh Appearance
:
Dewy finish sunscreens provide a fresh and natural appearance to the skin, making them suitable for everyday use. They leave the skin looking youthful and dewy, which can enhance its natural beauty.
Versatility with Makeup
:
Dewy finish sunscreens work well as a base for makeup, creating a hydrated canvas for foundation and other products. They contribute to a dewy and luminous foundation look, which is popular in certain makeup styles.
Ideal for Daytime Events
:
The radiant effect of dewy finish sunscreens makes them well-suited for daytime events and casual outings. They can give your skin a healthy and vibrant appearance in natural lighting.
Comfortable Wear
: Dewy finish sunscreens often have a lightweight and comfortable feel on the skin, making them pleasant to wear throughout the day.
Conceals Dryness
:
Individuals with dry skin may benefit from dewy finishes as they help conceal dry patches and prevent the skin from looking dull.
It's important to note that the choice between dewy and matte finish sunscreens ultimately depends on personal preferences, skin type, and the desired aesthetic. While dewy finishes offer these benefits, individuals with oily skin might find that matte finishes better suit their needs by controlling excess shine.
Why Choose a Matte Finish Sunscreen?
Selecting a sunscreen with a matte texture can have several advantages, particularly for people with particular skin types or preferences. You may choose a matte finish sunscreen for a variety of reasons, including oil control, pore minimization, long-lastingness, suitability for all skin types, no grease residue, moisturising powders, photogenic qualities, and everyday adaptability. It's crucial to take your skin type and preferences into account when deciding between sunscreens with a dewy or matte finish. While matte finishes appeal to people who want their skin to look shiny-free, dewy finishes may feel more comfortable and moisturising on those with dryer skin. Furthermore, others use a hybrid method, using dewy finishes for desired extra radiance and matte finishes for specified places.
Tailoring Sunscreen to Your Skin Type
Sunscreen should be tailored to your specific skin type to ensure that you get the best protection while also meeting your skin's unique needs. Here are guidelines for selecting sunscreen based on the various skin types:
Oily Skin:
Choose a sunscreen that is lightweight, oil-free, and non-comedogenic.
Choose a matte finish to control excess oil throughout the day.
Look for sunscreens containing oil-absorbing ingredients such as silica or kaolin clay.
To protect against UVA and UVB rays, apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30.
Dry Skin:
Choose a sunscreen containing hydrating ingredients like glycerin, hyaluronic acid, or natural oils.
Dewy finish sunscreens can provide additional hydration and a luminous appearance.
To avoid further dryness, choose a sunscreen that contains moisturising ingredients.
Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30.
Combination Skin:
Consider a sunscreen that balances hydration without being too oily or heavy.
A satin or natural finish can work well for combination skin.
Look for a sunscreen with a mix of moisturising and oil-controlling ingredients.
Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30.
Sensitive Skin:
Opt for a sunscreen specifically formulated for sensitive skin, free from common irritants and allergens.
Choose a sunscreen with a gentle, hypoallergenic formulation.
Look for mineral sunscreens with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, as they tend to be less irritating.
Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30.
Normal Skin:
Normal skin types have the flexibility to use a variety of sunscreens.
Depending on personal preference, you can choose between matte, dewy, or natural finishes.
Look for a sunscreen with a balanced formulation that suits your needs.
Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30.
By taking into account your skin type and specific needs, you can select a sunscreen that not only provides effective sun protection but also complements your skin's characteristics and improves its overall health and appearance.

Sensitive Skin: Choosing the Right Sunscreen Finish
Choosing the best sunscreen for sensitive skin entails selecting a product with gentle ingredients and a finish that meets your needs. Here are some considerations when choosing the finish of a sunscreen for sensitive skin:
Mineral Sunscreens
: Choose a mineral or physical sunscreen containing zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. These ingredients sit on the skin's surface and are less prone to causing irritation than chemical filters.  Mineral sunscreens often provide a matte or natural finish.
Hypoallergenic Formulations
: Look for sunscreens labeled as hypoallergenic, as they are less likely to cause allergic reactions. Avoid products containing added fragrances, which can irritate sensitive skin.
Physical Sunscreens with Tint
: Tinted physical sunscreens can provide an extra layer of protection by adding a slight tint to the skin. The tint can also help to hide the white cast that is commonly associated with mineral sunscreens.
Fragrance-Free Options
: Choose sunscreens labeled as fragrance-free to minimize the risk of skin irritation. Fragrance-free options are less likely to contain potential allergens that can be harsh on sensitive skin.
Gentle Moisturizing Formulas
: Consider sunscreens with added moisturising ingredients, such as aloe vera, glycerin, or chamomile. These ingredients can help soothe sensitive skin and prevent dryness.
Non-Comedogenic Sunscreens
: Opt for sunscreens labeled as non-comedogenic to avoid clogging pores and potential breakouts. Non-comedogenic formulas are less likely to cause skin congestion, even for those with sensitive skin.
Physical Sunscreens with Dewy Finish
: Some physical sunscreens with a dewy finish can be suitable for sensitive skin. Look for products with added hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid.
All-Mineral Sunscreens
: Choose a sunscreen that relies solely on mineral filters, which tend to be less irritating for sensitive skin. All-mineral sunscreens may provide a matte or natural finish.
Water-Based Formulas
: Water-based sunscreens can be gentle on sensitive skin. They are lightweight and less likely to feel heavy or greasy.
Patch Test New Products
:
Always perform a patch test before applying a new sunscreen to your face. Apply a small amount to a discreet area to check for any adverse reactions.
Broad-Spectrum Protection
:
Ensure that the chosen
sunscreen provides broad-spectrum protection
against both UVA and UVB rays.
It's crucial to pay attention to your skin's needs and select a sunscreen that doesn't irritate it. For individualised advice, speak with a dermatologist if you have any particular allergies or sensitivities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours, or more frequently if you're swimming or perspiring. You should also think about taking further steps to protect yourself from the sun, such finding shade and dressing in protective gear.
Integrating Sunscreen into Your Beauty Routine
Including sunscreen in your beauty regimen is essential to keeping your skin protected and healthy. Here's how to smoothly add sunscreen to your regular skincare and makeup routine, step-by-step:
The morning skincare routine includes
cleansing the face
, applying toner (optional), using serums and treatment products, moisturising, applying sunscreen, and waiting for absorption.
Makeup application includes primer (optional), foundation, concealer, and other makeup.
Throughout the day, reapply sunscreen.
Tips for Successful Integration
:
Make using sunscreen a daily habit, even on cloudy days or when staying indoors. UV rays can penetrate windows, so protection remains necessary.
Layer your products in the following order: cleanser, toner, treatment products, moisturiser, and sunscreen. If you use a separate primer, apply it after the sunscreen.
While some makeup products contain SPF, relying on them alone may not provide adequate sun protection. It is recommended that you use a dedicated sunscreen as the final step in your skincare routine.
Select a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB rays.
Sunscreen effectiveness decreases with time, so reapply every two hours, or more frequently if swimming or sweating.
Consistency is essential for effective sun protection. Make it a habit to apply sunscreen every morning, and consider incorporating it into your evening routine for extra protection during the day.
By incorporating sunscreen into your daily beauty routine, you not only protect your skin from harmful UV rays, but also promote overall skin health and
prevent premature ageing.
Makeup and Sunscreen: Achieving the Perfect Finish
Achieving the perfect finish with makeup and sunscreen requires careful product selection and strategic application.  Here's a step-by-step guide for seamlessly incorporating sunscreen into your makeup routine and achieving a flawless finish:
Prep Your Skin
: Start with a clean canvas by cleansing your face to remove any impurities. Follow with a toner if it's part of your routine. Use a moisturizer suitable for your skin type to provide hydration. Allow the moisturizer to absorb fully before moving on to sunscreen.
Sunscreen Application
:
Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30. Opt for a sunscreen that suits your skin type (matte for oily skin, dewy for dry skin). Dispense an adequate amount of sunscreen (at least a quarter-sized amount) and apply it evenly across your face and neck. Pay attention to areas that are often neglected, such as the ears, neck, and back of the neck. Allow the sunscreen to fully absorb into your skin before applying makeup. This typically takes a few minutes.
Makeup Application
: If you use a makeup primer, apply it after the sunscreen has fully absorbed. Some primers also contain SPF, providing an extra layer of protection. Choose a foundation that complements your skin type and blends well with the sunscreen. Apply the foundation evenly using a makeup sponge, brush, or your fingertips. Apply concealer to cover any blemishes or
under-eye circles
. Continue with other face makeup such as blush, bronzer, and highlighter.
Eye Makeup
:
If you use an eye primer, apply it before eyeshadow to ensure longevity. Apply eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara to complete your eye makeup.
Lips
:
Apply lip balm with SPF or your favorite lipstick. Remember, the lips are also susceptible to sun damage.
Set Your Makeup
:
Set your makeup with a translucent setting powder to reduce shine. Optionally, use a setting spray to lock in your makeup and provide a natural finish.
Reapplication (If Necessary)
:
If you need to reapply sunscreen during the day, consider using a powder or setting spray with SPF for convenient touch-ups over makeup.
Tips for a Flawless Finish
:
Mix a small amount of sunscreen into your foundation for added convenience, especially if you are in a hurry.
Layer your makeup products lightly to avoid a heavy or cakey look.
If you will be spending a lot of time outside, make sure to reapply sunscreen every two hours.
Make sun protection a part of your daily routine, even if you do not wear makeup.
By following these steps and selecting the appropriate products, you can seamlessly incorporate sunscreen into your makeup routine, achieving a flawless finish while protecting your skin from harmful UV rays.
Application Techniques for Different Sunscreen Finishes
The technique for applying sunscreen varies depending on the product's finish. Here are application techniques tailored to the various sunscreen finishes:
Dewy Finish Sunscreen
:
Amount
: Apply an adequate amount of dewy finish sunscreen to ensure complete coverage. Use about a quarter-sized amount on the face and neck.
Warm It Up
: Rub the sunscreen between your fingers to warm it up before applying. This helps with smoother application.
Dab and Blend
:
Dab small dots of sunscreen onto different areas of your face – forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin. Gently blend the sunscreen into your skin using upward and outward motions. Pay attention to blending along the jawline and hairline.
Use a Makeup Sponge
: If you wear makeup, consider using a makeup sponge to blend the sunscreen. It can help achieve an even and natural-looking finish.
Avoid Rubbing Too Much
: Dewy finish sunscreens often contain moisturizing ingredients that can be diluted or compromised with excessive rubbing. Patting and gentle blending work best.
2.Matte Finish Sunscreen
:
Apply in Sections
: Due to the potentially quick-drying nature of matte finish sunscreens, apply them in sections to ensure even coverage.
Spread Quickly
: Quickly spread the sunscreen across different areas of your face to avoid patches or uneven application.
Use Your Fingers
: For matte finishes, using your fingers can work well. The warmth from your fingers can help the product spread evenly.
Blotting Motion
: Consider using a blotting motion rather than rubbing when applying matte finish sunscreen. This helps control shine while ensuring coverage.
3. Powder Sunscreen:
Use a Brush
: Powder sunscreens are commonly applied with a brush. Choose a brush with soft, dense bristles to ensure an even application.
Buffing Motion
: Apply powder sunscreen by buffing it in. To ensure that the product is evenly distributed on the skin, swirl the brush in circular motions.
Reapply as needed
: Powder sunscreens are ideal for reapplication throughout the day. Use a brush to reapply makeup without disturbing it.
4.Tinted Sunscreen
:
Dot and Blend
:
Apply tinted sunscreen by dotting it on various areas of your face. Gently blend the product using your fingers, a makeup sponge, or a brush.
Even Coverage
: Ensure even coverage, especially if the tinted sunscreen serves as a replacement for foundation or BB cream.
Layering
: Tinted sunscreens often provide sheer coverage. If more coverage is desired, consider layering with other makeup products.
Remember that even and thorough application of sunscreen is essential for effective protection. Choose the technique that best suits your desired sunscreen finish and incorporate it into your daily skincare routine.
Sunscreen Reapplication: Keeping Your Skin Protected
Sunscreen reapplication is essential for providing adequate sun protection throughout the day. Here's when, how, and why you should reapply sunscreen:
When to Reapply
:
Every Two Hours
: Reapply sunscreen every two hours, whether you are inside or out. UV rays can penetrate windows, and the effectiveness of sunscreen diminishes over time.
After Swimming or Sweating
: Reapply sunscreen immediately after swimming or sweating, even if the product claims to be water-resistant. Towel drying can remove sunscreen, reducing its effectiveness.
During Prolonged Sun Exposure
: If you're spending extended periods outdoors, consider reapplying sunscreen more frequently, especially if you are sweating or swimming.
How to Reapply
:
Remove Sweat and Oil
: Before reapplying, gently blot or wipe away excess sweat or oil using a clean tissue or blotting paper.
Avoid Disturbing Makeup
: If you're wearing makeup, consider using a powder sunscreen for touch-ups to avoid disturbing your makeup. Alternatively, use a setting spray with SPF for a light reapplication over makeup.
Use Enough Product
: Apply at least the recommended amount of sunscreen for the face and body during reapplication. For the face, a quarter-sized amount is typically recommended.
Don't Forget Often Missed Areas
: Ensure you cover commonly missed areas during reapplication, such as the ears, neck, and the back of the neck.
Consider Portable Options
: Carry a travel-sized or portable sunscreen for on-the-go reapplication throughout the day. Powder sunscreens and sunscreen sticks are convenient options for touch-ups.
You may enhance the health of your skin and protect yourself from the damaging effects of UV radiation by reapplying sunscreen on a frequent and appropriate basis.
Beyond the Finish: Other Important Sunscreen Considerations
Beyond the finish, there are several important considerations when it comes to choosing and using sunscreen effectively. Here are some additional factors to keep in mind:
Choose Adequate SPF:
Select a sunscreen with a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of at least 30. Higher SPFs provide more protection, but the increase in protection is not proportional to the SPF number.
Look for Broad-Spectrum:
Ensure that the sunscreen provides broad-spectrum protection, covering both UVA and UVB rays.
Consider Your Skin Type:
Different skin types have unique needs. Choose a sunscreen that suits your skin type, whether it's oily, dry, sensitive, or a combination.
Opt for Water-Resistant Formulas:
If you're swimming or sweating, choose a water-resistant sunscreen and reapply after the recommended time (usually every 40 or 80 minutes).
Know the Active Ingredients:
Understand the active ingredients in your sunscreen. Chemical (organic) sunscreens absorb UV rays, while physical (mineral) sunscreens reflect them. Some people may have sensitivities to specific ingredients.
Consider Allergies:
If you have allergies or sensitive skin, opt for sunscreens labeled as hypoallergenic, fragrance-free, and designed for sensitive skin.
Apply Enough Sunscreen:
Most people apply too little sunscreen. Use at least a quarter-sized amount for the face and more for the body. Insufficient application reduces the effectiveness of the product.
Follow Reapplication Guidelines:
Reapply sunscreen every two hours or more frequently if swimming, sweating, or wiping your face.
Consider Sunscreen and Makeup Compatibility:
Some makeup products contain SPF, but relying solely on them may not provide sufficient protection. Use a dedicated sunscreen under makeup.
Check Expiration Dates:
Sunscreen effectiveness can decrease over time. Check the expiration date on your sunscreen, and avoid using expired products.
Be Aware of Medication Interactions:
Certain medications can increase sensitivity to the sun. Consult with your healthcare provider to understand how medications may interact with sun exposure.
Adapt for Different Areas:
Consider different sunscreen formulations for various body parts. For example, use a sweat-resistant formula for the body and a more gentle formula for the face.
Use Specific Sunscreens for Children:
Children's skin is often more sensitive. Use sunscreens specifically formulated for kids and follow application guidelines.
Consider Protective Clothing:
Clothing with a UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) rating provides an extra layer of protection against UV rays.
Monitor Your Skin:
Perform regular skin checks and
consult a dermatologist
if you notice any changes in moles or skin conditions.
Avoid Peak Sun Hours:
Limit sun exposure during peak hours (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.) when the sun's rays are strongest.
Protect Your Eyes:
Wear sunglasses that provide UV protection to safeguard your eyes from harmful rays.
Choose Reef-Friendly Sunscreens
: Some sunscreen ingredients can harm marine life, so look for sunscreens labelled reef-friendly.
Make Sunscreen a Daily Habit
: Apply sunscreen every day, whether it is sunny or cloudy, to ensure consistent protection.
By taking these factors into account, you can make more informed decisions and ensure that you are receiving the best sun protection for your specific needs and circumstances.
Broad-Spectrum Protection: Why It Matters
When selecting a sunscreen, broad-spectrum protection is essential since it guarantees that you are protected from UVA and UVB radiation. For complete sun care, which addresses both the short-term risk of sunburn and the long-term risk of premature ageing and skin cancer, broad-spectrum protection is crucial. Always search for "broad-spectrum" sunscreens when choosing one to guarantee that you are protected from UVA and UVB radiation in an even amount.
Mineral vs. Chemical Sunscreens: What's Best for You?
Individual preferences, skin type, and specific needs determine whether to use mineral (physical) or chemical (organic) sunscreens. Here's a breakdown of the characteristics of each type to help you decide which one is best for you:
Mineral Sunscreens
:
Active Ingredients
: Minerals such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide create a physical barrier on the surface of the skin by physically blocking and scattering UV rays.
How They Work
: Mineral sunscreens have a reflective action that deflects UV rays away from the skin. Generally speaking, mineral sunscreens are thought to be kinder to skin, which makes them appropriate for sensitive skin.
Pros
: Protection from UVA and UVB rays that are broad-spectrum. Ideal for skin that is reactive or sensitive, this product is gentle on it. The product begins working as soon as it is applied.
Cons
: Some formulations can leave a white cast on the skin.  This can be thicker and may require more effort to blend.
Ideal For
: Individuals with sensitive or allergic skin. Children are frequently recommended because of their gentle nature. This product is appropriate for skin that has undergone a procedure, such as laser treatment or chemical peel.
Chemical Sunscreens
:
Active Ingredients
:
Avobenzone, Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Oxybenzone, and other chemicals absorb UV rays and convert them into heat, which is then released through the skin.
How They Work
: Chemical sunscreens have an absorbent action, meaning they absorb UV radiation. Typically, they have a lighter and more cosmetically elegant texture.
Pros
: The product absorbs into the skin without leaving a white residue. Often preferred for everyday use under makeup. Formulations and textures are available in a wide range of options.
Cons
: Some people may have skin sensitivities or allergies to certain chemical filters. Chemical sunscreens may take approximately 20 minutes to become effective after application.
Ideal For
: Those who want a sunscreen that blends in with their daily skincare and makeup routine. Lighter textures are better suited to outdoor activities and sports.
The "best" sunscreen is one that you will use consistently. It is critical to find a sunscreen that works well with your daily routine and meets your texture, application, and protection preferences. For best results, use a sunscreen with at least SPF 30 and broad-spectrum protection.
Tinted Sunscreens: Combining Protection with Aesthetics
Because they provide both sun protection and a little coverage, tinted sunscreens are a popular choice for those who prefer a simple skincare routine with a hint of makeup. Sun protection, even skin tone, lightweight coverage, natural finish, multipurpose, mixing in with skin tones, simplicity of application, and adaptability are the advantages of tinted sunscreens. When choosing a tinted sunscreen, it's important to consider your unique skincare needs, preferences, and desired coverage level. Try different formulations to find the perfect tinted sunscreen that fits your lifestyle and style preferences.
