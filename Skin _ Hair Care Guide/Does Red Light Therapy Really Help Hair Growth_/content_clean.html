<p><span>Up to 85% of men and up to 55% of women experience <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-fall-hair-loss">hair loss</a> throughout their lives. The good news is that new medications have emerged to aid hair regrowth. Red light treatment for hair growth is a safe and effective low-light laser therapy (LLLT) that can help increase hair density and health in a variety of alopecia conditions. This therapy has been used for decades, demonstrating its effectiveness in healing wounds and regenerating tissue, reducing pain and inflammation, and healing skin problems. However, it has recently shown encouraging benefits for activating hair follicles for growth, especially in people with <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/androgenetic-alopecia-causes-treatments-and-home-remedies">androgenetic alopecia</a>.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Science Behind Red Light Therapy: Mechanisms and Benefits</b></h3>

<p><span>Red light treatment is an example of LLLT, also known as photobiomodulation. It employs light with precise wavelengths to encourage hair growth. Although "lasers" is in the name, LLLT presently mostly employs non-coherent light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which may create light of various wavelengths with distinct effects on the human body. Red light treatment, as the name implies, uses red or near-infrared light with wavelengths ranging from 630 to 700 nm (660 nm is commonly chosen). They permeate the scalp and improve cell function, which promotes hair development.</span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>How long does it take for red light therapy to promote hair growth?</strong> </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Clarification</b><span>: Red light therapy promotes the body's natural growth processes at the cellular level. In the best situations, consumers have noticed improvements in their hair condition in as little as 16 weeks.</span></p>

</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>RLT alone is sufficient for complete hair restoration.</strong> </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Clarification</b><span>: In most cases, hair regrowth has been documented after 12 to 26 weeks of red light treatment, including decreased hair loss each day and a considerable improvement in hair growth on the head.
