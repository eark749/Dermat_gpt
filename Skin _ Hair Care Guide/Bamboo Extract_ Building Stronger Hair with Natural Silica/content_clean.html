<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Myth 1</b><span>: Bamboo extract can make hair grow faster. </span></p>

<li>
<p><b>Fact</b><span>: While bamboo extract can improve scalp health and produce a conducive environment for <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hair-regrow-serum%20">hair growth</a>, it does not directly speed up hair growth. Genetics and overall health are the primary elements that influence hair growth rate.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Myth 2</b><span>: Bamboo extract may mend split ends. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Fact</b><span>: Bamboo extract, notably its silica concentration, helps strengthen hair and minimize the number of split ends. However, split ends cannot be mended. Trimming is the only efficient method of dealing with split ends.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Myth 3</b><span>: Bamboo extract can thicken hair strands. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Fact</b><span>: Bamboo extract can increase the general health and thickness of hair by strengthening hair follicles and fostering healthier growth. Individual hair strands' thicknesses, however, remain unchanged.</span></p>

</li>
<li>

Consult a healthcare professional or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">dermatologists</a> for accurate diagnosis and treatment of hair loss.</span></p>

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Fact</b><span>: Bamboo extract is lightweight and non-greasy, therefore it is appropriate for all hair types, especially oily hair. However, if a hair care product containing bamboo extract is mixed with heavy oils or silicones, it may cause greasiness. Before using any product, always verify the ingredient list.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Myth 6</b><span>: Bamboo extract is not suited for hairs with <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-colour">hair color</a>. </span></p>
