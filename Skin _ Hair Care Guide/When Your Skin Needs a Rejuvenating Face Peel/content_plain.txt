Persistent Acne and Scar Tissue: How Peels Can Help
Persistent
acne
and scar tissue are difficult to control, but chemical peels can help improve these disorders. Here's how chemical peels can assist with chronic acne and scar tissue:
Chemical peels with salicylic or
glycolic acid
can infiltrate the pores and exfoliate the skin, eliminating dead skin cells, oil, and debris that cause acne breakouts.
Peels assist control oil production by lowering excess sebum, which can block pores and cause acne.
Certain peels have anti-inflammatory properties that can calm redness, swelling, and irritation associated with acne.
Regular use of peels can help prevent future acne breakouts by keeping pores clean and minimizing bacterial growth.
Ageing Signs and Fine Lines: Rejuvenation Through Peeling
Rejuvenating peels can assist in reducing aging symptoms including
fine lines and wrinkles
, resulting in smoother, more youthful skin. Here's how peels can help with aging indicators and how to incorporate them into your skincare routine:
Stimulate Collagen Production
: Chemical peels with alpha hydroxy acids (
AHAs
) or trichloroacetic acid (TCA) can stimulate
collagen
formation, improving skin suppleness and reducing the appearance of fine wrinkles.
Exfoliate Dead Skin Cells
: Peels exfoliate dead skin cells off the skin's surface, revealing fresh, young skin beneath while smoothing out fine wrinkles and rough texture.
Increase Cell Turnover
: Peels promote cell turnover, which can reduce fine wrinkles, enhance skin tone, and provide a more radiant complexion.
Enhance Product Absorption
: Following a peel, skincare products such as serums and
moisturizers
can permeate deeper into the skin, increasing their effectiveness in treating aging indications.

Glycolic Acid Peels: For a Brighter, Smoother Finish
Glycolic acid peels are an effective skincare procedure for brightening and smoothing the complexion. This blog explains what they are and how they work. Glycolic acid is a form of alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) produced from sugarcane. It has the lowest molecular size of all AHAs, allowing it to penetrate deep into the skin. Glycolic acid peels entail applying a glycolic acid solution to the skin, which exfoliates the outermost layer of dead skin cells. This procedure promotes cell turnover and collagen formation, resulting in a more youthful, bright complexion. The benefits of glycolic acid peels are:
Glycolic acid effectively removes dead skin cells, dirt, and excess oils from the skin’s surface, revealing newer and healthier skin underneath.
Regular use of glycolic acid can help smooth out rough skin texture, reducing the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and acne scars.
By promoting cell turnover, glycolic acid helps to fade dark spots, hyperpigmentation, and uneven skin tone, leading to a brighter complexion.
Glycolic acid can penetrate pores to remove impurities, reducing the likelihood of breakouts and blackheads.
his acid stimulates collagen synthesis, which helps to improve skin elasticity and firmness over time.
Salicylic Acid Peels: Targeting Acne and Oil Control
Salicylic acid
peels are a common way to treat acne and decrease excess oil production. In this blog, we'll look at what salicylic acid is, how it works, and how it can help acne-prone skin. Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) produced from willow bark. It is oil-soluble, allowing it to enter deep into the pores for excellent exfoliation and unclogging. Salicylic acid peels include applying a salicylic acid-containing solution to the skin. Salicylic acid acts by reducing the connections between skin cells, promoting mild exfoliation, and unclogging pores. This method helps to remove excess oil, dead skin cells, and debris from the skin's surface. The benefits of salicylic acid peels are:
Salicylic acid effectively enters pores and exfoliates the skin, removing debris, oil, and dead skin cells that are trapped inside.
Salicylic acid is very helpful in treating acne because it reduces inflammation, clears pores, and prevents future breakouts.
It helps to manage oil production, making it ideal for people with oily or mixed skin types.
Salicylic acid unclogs pores by dissolving dirt and excess oil within them, preventing the creation of blackheads and whiteheads.
Regular use of salicylic acid encourages moderate exfoliation, which can enhance skin texture, tone, and clarity.
Lactic Acid Peels: Gentle Solutions for Sensitive Skin
Lactic acid
peels provide mild yet effective remedies for people with sensitive skin. This blog provides a full review of lactic acid, how it works, and its benefits for sensitive skin. Lactic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) generated from milk. It's gentler than glycolic acid, making it an excellent choice for people with delicate or easily irritated skin. Lactic acid peels include applying a lactic acid solution to the skin. Lactic acid works by gently exfoliating the surface layer of dead skin cells, increasing cell turnover and revealing smoother, brighter skin beneath. It also hydrates and strengthens the skin's natural moisture barrier. Lactic acid peels have the following benefits for sensitive skin:
Lactic acid provides gentle exfoliation without causing excessive irritation or redness, making it suitable for sensitive skin types.
Unlike some other acids, lactic acid has humectant properties, meaning it attracts and retains moisture in the skin. This can help hydrate and soften the skin during and after treatment.
Regular use of lactic acid can help smooth out rough skin texture, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Lactic acid can help fade dark spots, hyperpigmentation, and uneven skin tone, resulting in a more radiant complexion.
Lactic acid strengthens the skin's natural moisture barrier, reducing sensitivity and enhancing overall skin health.
The Procedure: What to Expect During and After a Face Peel
A face peel, whether with glycolic acid, salicylic acid, lactic acid, or another type of chemical peel, requires a precise process and post-treatment maintenance to provide the best results with the fewest side effects. Here's what to expect during and after a facial peel:
During the Procedure
:
Before the peel, your skin will be carefully washed to eliminate any makeup, debris, or oils. Some practitioners may use a pre-peel solution to degrease the skin and improve peel penetration.
The peel solution, which contains the chosen acid (e.g., glycolic, salicylic, lactic), will be delicately applied to your skin using a brush or cotton applicator. The solution is placed on the skin for a particular amount of time, which is dictated by the peel's kind and concentration.
During the peel application, you may experience a mild tingling or burning sensation, especially with stronger peels. Your practitioner may use a fan to provide cooling and comfort.
Some peels require neutralization with water or a neutralizing solution to stop the acid's activity and prevent over-exfoliation.
After the peel is completed, your skin may be soothed with a calming serum or moisturizer to reduce any immediate discomfort or redness.
After the Procedure
:
Your skin may appear slightly red or flushed just after the peel. This is normal and should resolve within a few hours to a day, depending on the degree of the peel.
Your practitioner will provide you with precise recommendations for how to care for your skin after the peel. This may involve avoiding sun exposure, using gentle skincare products, and moisturizing regularly.
Depending on the depth of the peel, you may see minor flaking or peeling of the skin in the days following treatment. This is a natural aspect of the skin's renewal process and usually goes away within a few days or weeks.
It is essential to protect your skin from sun exposure following a peel because it will be more vulnerable to UV rays. Use
sunscreen
every day and avoid excessive sun exposure.
Depending on your skin's condition and treatment goals, you may need multiple peel sessions spaced several weeks apart to achieve optimal results.
Preparing Your Skin for a Peel: Essential Steps
Preparing your skin properly before a chemical peel is critical for achieving the best results and minimizing potential adverse effects. Here are some important steps to take when preparing your skin for a peel: consult with a professional, discontinue certain products, use sun protection, gentle cleansing, moisturize regularly, avoid waxing or hair removal, stay hydrated, follow pre-peel instructions, avoid sunburn or irritation, plan for downtime, patch test (if applicable), and communicate with your professional. By following these important steps and suggestions, you will successfully prepare your skin for a chemical peel and provide the groundwork for a favorable treatment outcome. Always prioritize your skin's health and safety by talking with a certified specialist before beginning any peel operation.
The Peeling Process: Techniques and Care
Chemical peel treatments rely heavily on the peeling process and post-peel maintenance to provide the best results while minimizing potential negative effects. Here's all you need to know about the peeling procedure, the procedures utilized during the treatment, and how to care for your skin afterward:
Peel Care Techniques
:
Before applying the peel solution, your skin will be cleansed thoroughly to remove any dirt, oil, or makeup. Some practitioners may also use a degreasing solution to enhance peel penetration.
The peel solution, which contains the desired acid (e.g., glycolic, salicylic, lactic), will be applied evenly to your skin with a brush or cotton applicator. The concentration and length of the application will be determined by the peel type and your skin's sensitivity level.
Some peels, especially stronger ones, may require neutralization with water or a specific neutralizing solution to stop the acid's activity and prevent over-exfoliation.
During the application, your practitioner will monitor your skin's response closely to ensure the peel is working effectively without causing excessive irritation.
Post-Peel Care:
After the peel solution is removed or neutralized, your skin may feel tight or dry. Apply a gentle, hydrating moisturizer to soothe and replenish moisture.
Avoid sun exposure just after a peel because your skin will be more sensitive to UV radiation. To protect your skin from UV damage, apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher every day.
Avoid using harsh skincare products, exfoliants, or makeup for several days after the peel. Use moderate, non-irritating skincare products prescribed by your practitioner.
Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated from within.
Hydration
supports skin healing and recovery post-peel.
Do not pick at or scrub your skin as it begins to peel. Allow the peeling process to occur naturally to avoid irritation and potential scarring.
Your practitioner will provide specific post-peel instructions tailored to your skin type and the type of peel performed. Follow these instructions carefully for the best results and to minimize side effects.
Post-Peel Care: Ensuring the Best Results
Post-peel care is critical for getting the best results and keeping your skin healthy after a chemical peel. Here's a complete guide to caring for your skin after a peel treatment:
Follow your practitioner's instructions
: Always follow the exact post-peel guidelines given by your skincare specialist. They will provide you personalized advise based on the sort of peel you underwent and your skin's specific requirements.
Moisturize regularly
: After a peel, apply a light, moisturizing moisturizer to soothe and nourish the skin. Choose formulations that are non-comedogenic and appropriate for your skin type.
Avoid Sun Exposure
: Protect your skin from direct sunlight and UV rays. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or more every day, even on cloudy days. When spending time outside, reapply sunscreen every two hours and use protective clothing and accessories like hats and sunglasses.
Stay Hydrated
: Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated from the inside. Hydration facilitates skin repair and improves overall skin health.
Gentle Cleansing
: Wash your skin with a moderate, non-foaming
cleanser
. Avoid strong cleansers or washes that may irritate the skin after peeling.
Avoid Exfoliation and Harsh Products
: For at least one week after the peel, do not use exfoliating scrubs, retinoids, or other active skincare products. Allow your skin to heal naturally and without further aggravation.
Do Not Pick at Peeling Skin
: If your skin begins to peel or flake, resist the temptation to pick at it. Allow the skin to shed normally to prevent injury or irritation.
Patience During the Healing Process
: Be patient during the peeling and recuperation phases. It is usual for the skin to go through a rejuvenation period following a peel, and the results will gradually become obvious over time.
Avoid Sweating and Heat
: Limit your exposure to heat sources, such as hot showers, saunas, and steam rooms, for a few days after peeling. Sweating excessively can irritate the skin and delay recovery.
Maintain a Consistent Skincare Routine
: Once your skin has completely recovered, return to the usual skincare routine prescribed by your practitioner. Use gentle cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreens that are appropriate for your skin type to maintain and improve the results of your peel.
Schedule Follow-Up Appointments
:
Schedule follow-up appointments with your skin care specialist for any extra treatments or evaluations that are recommended. Regular maintenance and follow-up treatments can help maximize and extend the advantages of your chemical peel.
Monitor for Adverse Reactions
:
Keep an eye out for any signs of adverse reactions, such as persistent redness, swelling, or discomfort. Contact your practitioner immediately if you experience any concerning symptoms post-peel.
