Tamarillo seed oil, obtained from the seeds of the tamarillo fruit (also known as tree tomato), provides several benefits for attaining glowing skin. This blog explains how we can harness the power of this oil in skincare.
The Science Behind Tamarillo Seed Oil
Tamarillo seed oil, obtained from the seeds of the tamarillo fruit (
Solanum betaceum
), is gaining popularity in skincare because of its outstanding nutrient profile and possible health advantages, which have been confirmed by scientific studies. Here's a more detailed look at the science behind tamarillo seed oil:
Tamarillo seed oil is high in important fatty acids, particularly linoleic (omega-6) and alpha-linolenic (omega-3). These fatty acids are essential for protecting the skin's lipid barrier, retaining moisture, and increasing skin suppleness and elasticity.
It includes high quantities of antioxidants, including vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols). Antioxidants shield the skin from oxidative stress caused by free radicals produced by UV radiation, pollution, and other environmental factors. This protection helps to prevent premature aging symptoms like fine lines,
wrinkles
, and age spots.
Tamarillo seed oil contains phytosterols, which are plant-derived chemicals that have anti-inflammatory properties. Phytosterols soothe and relax irritated skin, making the oil suitable for eczema, dermatitis, and sensitive skin.
Understanding Tamarillo Seed Oil: Composition and Properties
Tamarillo seed oil's mix of fatty acids, antioxidants such as vitamin E, and phytosterols provides numerous skincare benefits, including
moisturization
, anti-inflammatory properties, antioxidant protection, and skin barrier support. Tamarillo seed oil can help promote healthier, more vibrant skin, making it an important ingredient in current skincare formulations.
How Tamarillo Seed Oil Benefits Your Skin: Key Advantages
Tamarillo seed oil provides various significant benefits for skin health and appearance, thanks to its nutrient-dense composition and therapeutic qualities. Here are the main advantages of utilizing tamarillo seed oil in skincare:
Tamarillo seed oil is high in important fatty acids including omega-6 (linoleic acid) and omega-3 (alpha-linolenic acid). These fatty acids serve to maintain the skin's lipid barrier, which prevents moisture loss and improves skin hydration. Regular application of tamarillo seed oil can leave the skin feeling nourished, smooth, and supple.
Tamarillo seed oil has high levels of vitamin E, a strong antioxidant. Vitamin E shields the skin from the oxidative stress generated by free radicals, environmental contaminants, and UV radiation. Vitamin E prevents premature aging by neutralizing free radicals, which cause fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots.
These chemicals in tamarillo seed oil are anti-inflammatory. They soothe and relax sensitive skin, lowering redness, inflammation, and irritation. This makes tamarillo seed oil useful for sensitive skin disorders such as eczema, dermatitis, and rosacea.
Tamarillo seed oil includes phytosterols, which have the same structure as cholesterol and help to improve the skin's lipid barrier. A good skin barrier is critical for regulating moisture levels, defending against environmental aggressors, and fostering general skin health.
Tamarillo seed oil's antioxidant qualities, notably those derived from vitamin E, aid in protecting the skin's collagen and elastin fibres. The preservation of the skin's structural proteins promotes firmness, flexibility, and a younger appearance.
Tamarillo seed oil is lightweight and non-comedogenic, therefore it will not clog pores. It's appropriate for all skin types, including oily, combination, dry, and sensitive skin. Its balanced fatty acid structure and calming effects make it a useful ingredient in skincare products.
Comparing Tamarillo Seed Oil with Other Natural Oils
Comparing tamarillo seed oil to other natural oils might help you better grasp its unique qualities and benefits in skincare. Here's a comparison of some popular natural oils:
1. Tamarillo Seed Oil vs. Argan Oil
Tamarillo seed oil is derived from the seeds of the tamarillo fruit (
Solanum betaceum
), whereas argan oil is obtained from the kernels of the argan tree (
Argania spinosa
).
Tamarillo seed oil is high in linoleic acid (omega-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (omega-3), which provide great moisture and skin barrier support. Argan oil is high in oleic acid (omega-9) and contains linoleic acid, making it nutritious and moisturizing to the skin.
Both oils include antioxidants, with argan oil particularly high in vitamin E. Tamarillo seed oil also contains vitamin E, which provides comparable antioxidant protection against free radicals and environmental damage.
Tamarillo seed oil contains phytosterols, which have anti-inflammatory qualities and are good for calming sensitive or irritated skin. Argan oil is valued for its ability to moisturize and soften the skin, making it ideal for dry or aging skin.
2. Tamarillo Seed Oil vs. Rosehip Seed Oil
Tamarillo seed oil is derived from the tamarillo fruit, whereas rosehip seed oil is taken from rosehip fruit seeds (
Rosa canina
).
Tamarillo seed oil has a balanced ratio of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, whereas rosehip seed oil is strong in both linoleic acid (omega-6) and linolenic acid (omega-3). Rosehip oil is known for its skin regeneration capabilities, which aid in improving skin tone and texture.
Both oils are abundant in antioxidants, but rosehip seed oil is especially high in
vitamin C
, which brightens the skin and promotes collagen synthesis. Tamarillo seed oil contains vitamin E, which has similar antioxidant advantages for protecting the skin from free radicals.
Tamarillo seed oil is good for moisturizing, reducing inflammation, and strengthening the skin barrier. Rosehip seed oil is widely utilized for its anti-aging properties, scar reduction, and general skin vibrancy.
3. Tamarillo Seed Oil vs. Jojoba Oil
Tamarillo seed oil is obtained from tamarillo fruit seeds, whereas jojoba oil is taken from jojoba plant seeds (
Simmondsia Chinensis
).
Tamarillo seed oil contains more omega-3 fatty acids than jojoba oil, which is primarily constituted of monounsaturated fats (such as oleic acid) and is structurally comparable to human sebum.
Both oils include vitamin E, and jojoba oil has extra antioxidant benefits. Tamarillo seed oil's antioxidants help to prevent aging and protect the skin.
Jojoba oil is well-known for its moisturizing characteristics and ability to regulate oil production, making it ideal for all skin types, particularly oily and
acne
-prone skin. Tamarillo seed oil has a balanced fatty acid profile and soothing characteristics that help to keep sensitive skin hydrated and quiet.

cleanser
that is suitable for your skin type. This eliminates impurities, excess oil, and makeup, allowing your skin to better absorb the benefits of tamarillo seed oil.
Toning (Optional)
: Use a toner if it is part of your skincare regimen. Toning helps to regulate the pH of your skin and improves the absorption of subsequent skincare products.
Applying Tamarillo Seed Oil
: Apply a small amount of tamarillo seed oil to your fingertips. Typically, a few drops are sufficient to cover your entire face. Warm the oil between your palms before applying. This allows the oil to distribute more easily and improves absorption. Gently apply or massage tamarillo seed oil onto your face and neck. Use upward, circular motions to achieve even dispersion and circulation.
Absorption
:
Allow tamarillo seed oil to soak into your skin for a few minutes. It's lightweight and should absorb rapidly, leaving no oily behind.
Follow with Moisturizer (Optional)
: If preferred, apply your regular moisturizer to seal in the moisture and enhance hydration. This procedure is particularly useful if you have dry skin or live in a dry region.
Nighttime Routine (Optional)
: Use tamarillo seed oil as the final step in your skincare routine. Its antioxidant capabilities might help repair and revitalize your skin overnight.
Frequency
: Tamarillo seed oil can be used in the morning and evening as part of your skincare regimen. Adjust the frequency according to your skin's demands and reaction to the oil.
Spot Treatments (Optional)
: For targeted treatment, apply a little thicker layer of tamarillo seed oil to specific areas of concern, such as dry regions or those prone to inflammation or irritation.
Storage
:
To keep your tamarillo seed oil fresh and potent, store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. To prevent oxidation, ensure that the bottle is tightly sealed.

Best Practices for Storing Tamarillo Seed Oil
To keep tamarillo seed oil fresh, potent, and useful for skincare, it must be stored properly. Here are some good procedures for keeping tamarillo seed oil:
Choose the Right Container
: Tamarillo seed oil should be kept in a dark glass bottle, preferably amber or cobalt blue. This sort of bottle protects the oil from light, which can promote oxidation and reduce its quality. To avoid oxidation, ensure that the bottle has a tight-sealing top or dropper.
Store in a Cool, Dark Place
: Keep tamarillo seed oil in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Excessive heat can damage and shorten the oil's shelf life. Keep the storage space dry, as moisture can degrade the quality of the oil over time.

Allow chilled tamarillo seed oil to reach room temperature on its own. Avoid heating it quickly, as this can alter its qualities.
Avoid Exposure to Air and Light
: To avoid oxidation, keep the bottle well-packed when not in use. Exposure to air can cause the oil to become rancid more quickly.
Check for Spoilage
: Periodically inspect the oil for any changes in smell or color. If it develops a sour or unpleasant odor, or if the color darkens dramatically, it may be time to replace it.
Shelf Life
: Tamarillo seed oil has a shelf life of around 1-2 years when stored properly. Use it within this timeframe to ensure maximum freshness and effectiveness.
