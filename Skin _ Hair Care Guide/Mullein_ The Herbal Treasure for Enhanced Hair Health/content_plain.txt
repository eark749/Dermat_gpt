Mullein, sometimes referred to as Verbascum thapsus in science, is a very adaptable herb with many health advantages, some of which may be beneficial for hair health. Mullein has been applied topically to support hair development and scalp health, however, its historical applications in respiratory health are more well-known. We'll look at a few potential ways mullein could improve hair health in this blog.
Unravelling the Benefits of Mullein for Hair
Let us look more deeply into the specific benefits of mullein for hair health:
Mullein contains a variety of nutrients that are good for your hair, including vitamins (like vitamin A, C, and E) and minerals (like calcium, magnesium, and iron). These nutrients nourish the hair follicles, resulting in healthy hair growth and overall hair strength.
Mullein oil, derived from the plant's flowers and leaves, has high emollient properties.  When applied to the scalp and hair, mullein oil moisturizes and hydrates, preventing dryness and brittleness. This can result in softer and more manageable hair.
Mullein is anti-inflammatory and antiseptic, making it useful for soothing and calming scalp conditions like dandruff, eczema, and psoriasis. A healthy scalp environment is essential for promoting hair growth and
minimising hair loss.
While scientific evidence is limited, some anecdotal reports suggest that mullein may promote hair growth. This could be due to its purported ability to improve scalp circulation, which then nourishes the hair follicles and promotes hair growth.
The regular use of mullein-infused products or oils may help strengthen the hair shaft, reducing breakage and split ends.  Furthermore, mullein's conditioning properties can give hair a natural shine, leaving it looking healthy and vibrant.
Mullein is a natural alternative to commercial hair care products that is both gentle and effective. It is free of harsh chemicals and artificial ingredients, making it ideal for people with sensitive scalps or skin.
Mullein can be used in a variety of
hair care products
, including infused oils, herbal teas, and as an ingredient in homemade hair masks and rinses. This adaptability enables individuals to tailor their hair care routine to their specific needs and preferences.
While mullein shows promise for promoting hair health, it is important to remember that individual responses may vary, and more scientific research is needed to fully validate its efficacy. As with any herbal remedy, conduct a patch test before using mullein products extensively, and
consult
with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions.
Understanding Mullein: Composition and Hair Care Properties
Mullein, scientifically known as Verbascum thapsus, is a biennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, but it has become widely naturalised in other regions, including North America. While mullein is traditionally used to treat respiratory issues, its properties also make it useful for hair care.
Composition
:
Mullein contains saponins, which are natural compounds known for their cleansing properties. These compounds can help remove dirt, excess oil, and product buildup from the scalp and hair, resulting in a clean and healthy environment for hair growth.
Flavonoids are antioxidants found in mullein that help protect the scalp and hair follicles from oxidative stress caused by free radicals. This can help to keep the scalp healthy and protect the hair strands.
Mullein contains mucilage, which is a gel-like substance with emollient properties. Mucilage moisturises and hydrates the scalp and hair, preventing dryness while improving texture and manageability.
Mullein contains a variety of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin A, C, E, calcium, magnesium, and iron. These nutrients nourish the hair follicles, stimulate healthy hair growth, and strengthen the hair strands.
Hair Care Properties
:
Mullein oil and extracts can moisturise the scalp and hair, reducing dryness and improving overall hair health. Regular moisturising can improve hair softness, flexibility, and shine.
The emollient properties of mullein help condition the hair, leaving it feeling soft, smooth, and manageable. Mullein-infused hair care products can be especially useful for people who have dry or
damaged hair.
Mullein has anti-inflammatory properties that can relieve irritated scalp conditions like dandruff, eczema, and psoriasis.  By calming inflammation and reducing itching and redness, mullein promotes a healthier scalp environment for optimal hair growth.
The nutrients present in mullein, including vitamins and minerals, nourish the hair follicles and strengthen the hair shafts. This can help reduce breakage, split ends, and hair loss, leaving your hair stronger and more resilient.
Mullein's saponin content makes it ideal for cleansing the scalp and hair without removing too many natural oils. This gentle cleansing action can help to maintain the scalp's natural balance and encourage healthy hair growth.
The Role of Mullein in Promoting Hair Growth
While scientific research on mullein's specific effects on hair growth is limited, anecdotal evidence and its known properties indicate that mullein may promote hair growth via several mechanisms:
Scalp Health
: Mullein contains anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that can soothe and heal the scalp. Inflammation or infections can impede hair follicle function, so maintaining a healthy scalp environment is critical for optimal growth.
Improved Circulation
: Massaging mullein oil or extracts into the scalp can help increase blood flow to the hair follicles.  Increased circulation brings more oxygen and nutrients to the follicles, promoting health and hair growth.
Nutrient Nourishment
: Iron, calcium, magnesium, and other minerals, as well as vitamins A, C, and E, are abundant in mulein and are essential for the health of hair. These nutrients support healthy hair growth, fortify the hair shafts, and nourish the follicles that produce new hair.
Conditioning and Moisturising
: Mullein's emollient qualities prevent dryness and brittleness by hydrating the scalp and hair. Well-moisturized hair is less likely to break, allowing it to grow longer and healthier over time.
Reduction of Scalp Conditions
: Mullein's anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties can help with scalp conditions like dandruff, eczema, and psoriasis, which can impede hair growth.  By reducing inflammation and promoting scalp health, mullein may indirectly support hair growth.
Environmental Protection
: Mullein contains antioxidants that protect the scalp and hair follicles from free radicals and other environmental stressors.  This protection can help prevent premature hair loss and promote healthy hair growth.
Mullein Oil: A Potent Solution for Hair and Scalp Health
Mullein oil is an
effective solution
for improving both hair and scalp health. Here's why.
Moisturising Properties
: Mullein oil has a high emollient content, making it an excellent moisturiser for the scalp and hair. Regular application of mullein oil can help hydrate the dry scalp and hair, preventing issues like flakiness and itchiness.
Scalp Soothing
: Mullein oil has anti-inflammatory properties that can help relieve itchy scalp conditions like dandruff, eczema, and psoriasis. It soothes inflammation and reduces redness, promoting a healthier scalp environment that encourages hair growth.
Nutrition
: Mullein oil is high in essential nutrients such as vitamins A, C, and E, as well as calcium and magnesium. These nutrients nourish the hair follicles, strengthen the hair shafts, and stimulate healthy hair growth.
Hair Conditioning
: Mullein oil is a natural conditioner that leaves hair soft, smooth, and manageable. It improves hair texture and adds a natural shine, enhancing the overall appearance.
Hair Growth Stimulation
: While scientific evidence is limited, anecdotal reports indicate that mullein oil may stimulate hair growth. By improving scalp health, moisturising the hair, and nourishing the follicles, mullein oil creates a favorable environment for hair growth.
Antioxidant Protection
: Mullein oil contains antioxidants that shield the scalp and hair follicles from free radicals and environmental stresses. This protection prevents premature hair loss and helps to keep the scalp and hair in good condition.
Natural Ingredients
: Mullein oil is a chemical-free hair and scalp treatment. It is free of harsh additives and synthetic ingredients, making it ideal for people with sensitive scalps or skin.
To use mullein oil for hair and scalp health, massage a small amount into your scalp and hair, concentrating on the roots and ends. Leave it on for at least 30 minutes, or overnight for the best results, before washing it off with a gentle
shampoo.
You can also add a few drops of mullein oil to your regular conditioner or DIY
hair masks
for added nourishment. As with any new product, a patch test is required before using mullein oil extensively, especially if you have sensitive skin or allergies. If irritation develops, discontinue use immediately.
Integrating Mullein into Your Hair Care Regimen
Including mullein in your hair care routine can be a rewarding way to reap its potential benefits for scalp and hair health. Here's how you can add mullein to your routine.
Mullein-Infused Oil Treatment
:
Prepare mullein-infused oil by steeping dried mullein leaves or flowers in carrier oil such as olive oil or coconut oil for several weeks. Once ready, massage the infused oil into your scalp and hair, paying special attention to the roots and ends. Leave the oil on for at least 30 minutes, preferably overnight, to allow nutrients to penetrate the hair follicles and moisturise the scalp. Wash out the oil using a gentle shampoo and conditioner.
Mullein Herbal Rinse
: Brew a strong mullein tea by steeping dried mullein leaves or flowers in hot water for about 30 minutes. Allow the tea to cool, then strain out the leaves or flowers. After shampooing and conditioning your hair as usual, use the mullein tea as a final rinse. Pour it over your scalp and hair, making sure to distribute it evenly. Leave the herbal rinse in your hair for a few minutes before rinsing it out with cool water.
Mullein-infused shampoo and Conditioner
: Look for commercial hair care products that contain mullein extract or oil as an ingredient. These products can provide the benefits of mullein conveniently and are easy to incorporate into your existing hair care routine. Alternatively, you can add a few drops of mullein oil to your regular shampoo or conditioner to enhance its nourishing properties.
DIY Hair Masks
: Create your own hair mask by mixing mullein oil with other natural ingredients such as honey, yogurt, avocado, or banana. Apply the mask to damp hair, focusing on the lengths and ends. Leave the mask on for 20-30 minutes before rinsing it out with lukewarm water and shampooing as usual.
Regular Use
: Consistency is key when integrating mullein into your hair care regimen. Aim to use mullein-infused products or treatments regularly to experience the full benefits over time. Monitor the condition of your scalp and hair to assess any improvements and adjust your routine as needed.
Always perform a patch test before using mullein products extensively, especially if you have sensitive skin or allergies. Additionally, consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing scalp conditions. With regular use and proper care, mullein can be a valuable addition to your hair care arsenal, promoting healthier, more vibrant hair.
DIY Mullein Hair Treatments for Home Use
Making DIY mullein hair treatments at home is an excellent way to capitalise on the herb's potential benefits for hair and scalp health. Here are a few simple recipes to try:
Mullein Infused Oil
: Combine dried mullein leaves or flowers in a clean glass jar. Cover the mullein with a carrier oil like olive, coconut, or jojoba. Seal the jar tightly and keep it in a cool, dark place for 4-6 weeks, shaking occasionally. After the infusion, strain the mullein through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth. Transfer the infused oil to a clean storage container. To use, massage the mullein-infused oil into your scalp and hair for at least 30 minutes, preferably overnight, before washing with shampoo.
Mullein Herbal Rinse
: Brew a strong mullein tea by steeping dried mullein leaves or flowers in hot water for 30 minutes. Allow the tea to cool before straining out the leaves or flowers. After shampooing and conditioning, apply mullein tea to your scalp and hair as a final rinse.  Leave the herbal rinse in your hair for a few minutes before rinsing it out with cool water.
Mullein and Honey Hair Mask
: In a small bowl, combine 2-3 tablespoons of mullein oil and 1 tablespoon of raw honey. Optional: Add a few drops of essential oils such as lavender or rosemary for fragrance and extra benefits. Apply the mixture to damp hair, concentrating on the lengths and ends.  Leave the mask on for 20-30 minutes before rinsing it off with lukewarm water and shampooing normally.
Mullein Scalp Treatment
: In a bowl, combine equal parts mullein oil and aloe vera gel. Add a few drops of tea tree oil for its antiseptic properties, if desired. Part your hair and apply the mixture to your scalp, massaging gently.  Leave the treatment on for 15-20 minutes before rinsing it off with cool water and shampooing normally.
Mullein and Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse
: Mix equal parts mullein tea (brewed as described above) and apple cider vinegar in a bowl.  After shampooing your hair, apply the mixture to your scalp and hair as a final rinse. Allow it to sit for a few minutes before rinsing it under cool water.
Best Practices for Using Mullein in Daily Hair Care
There are several advantages for the health of your scalp and hair when you include mullein in your regular hair care regimen. Here are some tips for incorporating mullein into your regular hair care routine:
Select High-Quality Mullein Products
: Whenever possible, choose premium, organic mullein-infused products or ingredients.  This ensures that you are getting the most potent and pure form of mullein for the best results.
Perform Patch Tests
: Before using any new mullein product extensively, conduct a patch test to rule out any allergic reactions or sensitivities.  Apply a small amount of the product to a small area of the skin (for example, the inner forearm) and wait 24 hours to see if any adverse reactions occur.
Start Slowly
: If you are new to using mullein in your hair care routine, take it slowly to give your scalp and hair time to adjust.  Begin by using mullein-infused products or treatments once or twice a week, and gradually increase the frequency as needed.
Tailor to Your Needs
: Customise your mullein hair care routine based on your specific hair type and concerns. For example, if you have dry hair, you may benefit from applying moisturising mullein treatments more frequently, whereas those with oily hair may prefer lighter formulations.
Focus on Scalp Health
: Your scalp's health has a direct impact on the condition of your hair.  Massage mullein oil or treatments into your scalp to improve circulation, reduce inflammation, and create a healthy scalp environment for optimal hair growth.
Use Gentle Products
: Select gentle shampoo and conditioner formulas that will not strip your hair of natural oils.  Look for products that are free from harsh sulfates, parabens, and artificial fragrances, as these can irritate the scalp and dry out the hair.
Be Consistent
: When it comes to using mullein in your daily hair care routine, consistency is key.  Regular use of mullein-infused products or treatments can produce the best long-term results, so stick to your routine and be patient with the process.
Protect Your Hair
: Avoid excessive heat styling and exposure to harsh chemicals or environmental stressors that can harm your hair.  Use heat protectant sprays when using hot styling tools, and wear a hat or protective headgear when exposed to the sun or harsh weather conditions.
Eat a Balanced Diet and Stay Hydrated
: Keep in mind that healthy hair begins on the inside.  Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, and eat a healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids to nourish your hair from within.
Monitor Your Results
: Keep track of your hair's response to mullein treatments over time. If you notice any improvements or changes in your hair and scalp health, stick to your routine. However, if you have any adverse reactions or concerns, change your routine and consult with a healthcare professional if necessary.
Following these best practices and mindfully incorporating mullein into your daily hair care routine will result in healthier, more vibrant hair in the long run.
Customising Mullein Applications for Various Hair Types
Customising mullein applications for different hair types allows you to address specific needs while maximising the herb's benefits. Here's how you can customise mullein treatments for different hair types:
Dry Hair
: Use mullein-infused oil as a pre-shampoo treatment to moisturise and nourish your dry hair. Choose a thicker mullein oil formulation or add hydrating ingredients like honey or avocado to DIY hair masks. Incorporate mullein-infused conditioner into your regimen to add moisture and softness to dry hair strands.
Oily Hair
: Focus mullein-infused treatments on the scalp to avoid weighing down the hair with excess oil. Use a lighter mullein oil formulation or dilute it with a carrier oil such as grapeseed oil to improve absorption. Consider adding a few drops of essential oils with astringent properties like tea tree or lemon to balance oil production on the scalp.
Fine or Thin Hair
: Use mullein treatments sparingly to prevent weighing down fine or
thin hair.
Choose a lightweight mullein-infused conditioner or rinse to prevent buildup and maintain volume.  Mullein applications should be concentrated on the scalp to promote hair follicle health and growth without adding unnecessary weight to the hair shafts.
Thick or Coarse Hair
: Use mullein treatments liberally to provide deep hydration and nourishment. Consider leaving mullein-infused oil treatments on overnight to get deep into the hair shafts and condition dry or damaged areas. Use mullein-infused products with rich, creamy textures to help tame frizz and add definition to thick or coarse hair textures.
Curly or Wavy Hair
:
Use mullein treatments to enhance curl definition and reduce frizz in curly or wavy hair. Incorporate mullein-infused leave-in conditioners or styling products to maintain moisture and shape throughout the day. Consider combining mullein with other ingredients like shea butter or argan oil to enhance curl definition and improve manageability.
Color-Treated Hair
:
Choose mullein-infused treatments that are gentle and color-safe to avoid stripping or fading hair color. Look for mullein products designed specifically for color-treated hair, or make your own treatments with ingredients known to preserve colours, such as coconut oil or hibiscus extract. Before using mullein treatments on color-treated hair, perform a patch test to ensure compatibility and avoid unwanted colour changes.
Customising mullein applications to suit different hair types allows you to effectively address specific concerns while also reaping the benefits of this versatile herb for healthier, more beautiful hair.
Beyond Hair Growth: The Holistic Impact of Mullein
Mullein's benefits go far beyond hair growth and include a variety of holistic health effects. Here are some other ways mullein can improve your well-being:
Mullein has a long history of use in traditional medicine to treat respiratory ailments like coughs, bronchitis, and asthma.  Its expectorant and soothing properties help to relieve congestion, inflammation, and improve respiratory comfort.
Mullein contains anti-inflammatory compounds, which make it useful for reducing inflammation throughout the body.  This may help with conditions like arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and skin inflammation.
Mullein is high in antioxidants, which help to neutralise free radicals and improve immune function. Incorporating mullein into your diet or using it in herbal teas may help strengthen your body's natural defenses against infections and illness.
Mullein has long been used to ease gastrointestinal discomfort and promote digestive health. Its mild laxative and anti-inflammatory properties may help relieve indigestion, bloating, and constipation symptoms.
Mullein has emollient properties, making it useful for skincare.  It can moisturise dry skin, soothe irritation, and aid in the healing of minor wounds or skin conditions like eczema and dermatitis.
Mullein oil has traditionally been used as a natural treatment for earaches and infections. Its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties have the potential to alleviate ear canal pain and inflammation.
The antimicrobial qualities of mulein can aid in the fight against specific kinds of fungi and bacteria. It can be taken internally to support immune system function generally, or topically to prevent or treat skin infections.
Mullein has mild sedative properties that can help you relax and reduce stress. Drinking mullein tea or using mullein-infused bath products may help to relax the mind and body, promoting overall well-being.
Mullein has diuretic properties that can help the body's natural detoxification processes by increasing urination and flushing toxins from the kidneys and bladder.
Mullein, according to some herbalists, may have hormone-balancing properties, particularly in women who have irregular menstrual cycles or menopausal symptoms. However, more research is required in this field.
Before using mullein, as with any other herbal remedy, consult a healthcare professional, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications. Also, be aware of potential allergic reactions and begin with small doses to determine your tolerance. Overall, including mullein in your holistic health routine can provide numerous benefits to your body, mind, and spirit.
Soothing Scalp Issues with Natural Mullein Remedies
Soothing scalp issues with natural mullein remedies can be an effective and gentle way to address various concerns. Here are some ways mullein can help alleviate scalp problems:
Mullein Oil Scalp Massage
: Warm the mullein oil slightly and apply it directly to your scalp. Gently massage the oil into your scalp in circular motions. Leave the oil on for at least 30 minutes or overnight for maximum benefits. Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo to remove the oil.
Mullein Tea Rinse
: Leave dried mullein leaves or flowers in hot water for 30 minutes to steep them into a strong mullein tea. Allow the tea to cool completely before straining out the leaves or flowers.  After shampooing, apply the mullein tea to your scalp and hair as a final rinse. Leave the tea on for a few minutes before rinsing it out with cool water.
Mullein and Aloe Vera Scalp Mask
: In a bowl, combine equal parts mullein oil and fresh aloe vera gel.  Optionally, add a few drops of tea tree oil for its antimicrobial properties. Apply the mixture to your scalp, focusing on any areas of irritation or inflammation. Leave the mask on for 20-30 minutes before rinsing it out with lukewarm water and shampooing as usual.
Mullein and Apple Cider Vinegar Scalp Tonic
: In a bowl, combine equal parts mullein oil and raw apple cider vinegar. Add a few drops of lavender essential oil for extra soothing effects. Apply the tonic to the scalp with a cotton ball or spray bottle. Leave it on for 15-20 minutes before rinsing off with cool water.
Mullein and Coconut Oil Scalp Treatment

Place the cloth on your scalp and leave it there for 15-20 minutes. Repeat this process several times per week to provide soothing relief.
These organic mullein treatments can relieve dandruff, irritation, itching, and dryness in the scalp. For an accurate diagnosis and course of therapy, you should see a dermatologist or other healthcare provider if your scalp issues worsen or continue.
The Antioxidant Benefits of Mullein in Hair Care
Mullein provides antioxidant benefits in hair care, which can help to promote healthier hair and scalp. Here's how it is done:
Mullein contains antioxidants such as flavonoids and phenolic compounds, which help to neutralise free radicals.  Free radicals can harm hair follicles, resulting in hair loss, premature greying, and general hair damage.  By scavenging free radicals, mullein protects the hair follicles and supports overall hair health.
Through the reduction of oxidative stress, the antioxidants in mullein can improve scalp health.  Dandruff, irritation, and inflammation can result from an unhealthy scalp environment that is marked by oxidative stress. By reducing oxidative damage, mullein antioxidants support a healthy scalp, which is essential for optimal hair growth.
Split ends and breakage can result from free radicals weakening the hair shaft. The antioxidants in mulein aid in fortifying the hair shaft, increasing its resilience to harm. As a result, the hair becomes stronger, more resilient, and less prone to split ends.
Environmental elements that can cause oxidative stress to hair include pollution, UV rays, and severe weather.  By acting as a barrier against environmental harm, mullein antioxidants help to maintain the health and vibrancy of hair.
Oxidative stress speeds up ageing, causing greying and thinning hair to appear earlier than it should. By neutralising free radicals, mullein antioxidants help slow down the aging process, maintaining the youthful appearance and vitality of the hair.
Embracing Sustainable and Herbal Hair Care with Mullein
Using mullein for sustainable and herbal hair care is a great way to prioritise both your hair and the environment. Here's how to incorporate mullein into a sustainable and herbal hair care regimen:
Cultivate Your Own Mullein
: If the weather permits, grow mullein in your garden or outdoor space. Mullein is a hardy biennial plant that thrives in a variety of environments, making it relatively easy to grow. By growing your own mullein, you reduce the environmental impact associated with transportation and packaging.
Wildcraft Responsibly
: If you prefer to harvest mullein in the wild, do so in a responsible and ethical manner. Only harvest from areas where mullein is abundant, and obtain permission if harvesting on private land. Harvest sustainably, leaving enough plants behind to ensure future growth and reproduction.
Support Sustainable Brands
: Look for hair care brands that value sustainability and use ethically sourced ingredients, such as mullein. Choose products that are packaged in recyclable or biodegradable materials and manufactured with environmentally friendly practices.
DIY Herbal Hair Care
: Make your own herbal hair care products from mullein and other natural ingredients.  Mullein-infused oils, herbal rinses, masks, and treatments can be made at home using recipes available online and in herbal remedy books. Making your own products gives you control over the ingredients and reduces your reliance on commercial products containing potentially harmful chemicals.
Reduce Water Consumption
: Minimise the frequency with which you wash your hair. Mullein-infused dry shampoos and herbal rinses can help refresh and cleanse the scalp in between washes, eliminating the need for water. When washing your hair, take shorter showers and collect the water in a basin to use for watering plants or other purposes.
Choose Multi-Purpose Ingredients
: Look for ingredients that can perform multiple functions in your hair care regimen. Mullein oil, for example, can be used to treat the scalp, condition the hair, and style the hair, eliminating the need for multiple products and packaging.
Share Knowledge
: Share your knowledge and enthusiasm for sustainable and herbal hair care with others. Educate friends and family on the benefits of mullein and other herbal remedies for hair health, and encourage them to incorporate more sustainable practices into their daily routines.
By embracing sustainable and herbal hair care with mullein, you not only improve the health of your hair but also contribute to a healthier planet and a more conscious approach to personal care.

Mullein can be added to a variety of hair care products, including oils, shampoos, conditioners, herbal rinses, and masks. Choose formulations that are consistent with your hair goals and preferences.  For example, if you have dry hair, use moisturising mullein-infused oils or deep
conditioning masks.
Experiment with various mullein treatments to see which works best for your hair. DIY mullein treatments can be made with oils, teas, or herbal extracts and customised with additional ingredients such as essential oils, herbs, or carrier oils to meet your specific needs.
Depending on your hair type and condition, you may need to adjust the frequency of mullein treatments. Those with dry or damaged hair may benefit from more frequent use, whereas those with oily hair may prefer less frequent application to avoid weighing it down.
When adding mullein to your regimen, remember to pay attention to the condition of your scalp. For the best possible hair growth and general health of the hair, a healthy scalp is necessary. To nourish and calm the scalp, try applying herbal rinses or treatments laced with mullein.
