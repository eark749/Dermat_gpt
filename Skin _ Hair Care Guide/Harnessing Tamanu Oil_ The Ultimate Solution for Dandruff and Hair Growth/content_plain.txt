Tamanu oil is a natural oil extracted from the nuts of the tamanu tree (Calophyllum inophyllum), which grows in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. Because of its potentially therapeutic characteristics, it has traditionally been used for a variety of skin and hair care applications. While tamanu oil has grown in popularity as a possible treatment for dandruff and hair growth, it is crucial to emphasise that scientific research on its precise effects for these purposes is limited.  While tamanu oil has antibacterial and nourishing characteristics that may help with dandruff and hair development, there isn't enough scientific proof to back up these claims. If you decide to use tamanu oil, do so with caution and as a supplement to a broader hair and scalp care routine.
Introduction to Tamanu Oil
Tamanu oil is a natural oil obtained from the nuts of the tamanu tree (Calophyllum inophyllum), which grows in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Because of its possible health and beauty benefits, this oil has been used for generations in traditional medicine and skincare. Tamanu oil is known for its dark green color and distinct nutty aroma. While tamanu oil has garnered recognition for its potential qualities, the scientific study of its numerous applications is still in its early stages. Tamanu oil is produced from the nuts of the tamanu tree in several steps. Sun-drying the nuts, splitting them open to reveal the kernel, and then cold-pressing or expeller-pressing the kernel to extract the oil are the general stages. This oil extraction method aids in the preservation of the oil's inherent qualities. However, it is critical to approach its use with an understanding of its properties and potential benefits, as well as awareness of your own skin's specific needs and reactions.
Origins and Extraction of Tamanu Oil
Tamanu oil is made from the nuts of the tamanu tree (Calophyllum inophyllum), which grows in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Several processes are involved in the oil extraction process to produce the precious oil from the tamanu nuts. This blog provides an overview of tamanu oil's origins and extraction process:
Origins
: The tamanu tree, also known scientifically as Calophyllum inophyllum, is a tropical evergreen tree endemic to Tahiti, Fiji, Indonesia, and Madagascar. It grows well in sandy soils and thrives in coastal areas. The tree bears small, fragrant white blossoms and green fruit, which eventually provide the tamanu nuts from which the oil is extracted.
Extraction Process
: Tamanu oil extraction includes numerous phases, and traditional methods are frequently utilised to retain the oil's natural qualities. The following is a broad summary of the extraction process, which includes collecting and drying, cracking, sun drying, cold pressing or expeller pressing, filtration, bottling, and storage.
Nutrient Composition of Tamanu Oil
Tamanu oil is well-known for its distinct nutrient profile, which comprises a wide range of fatty acids, antioxidants, and bioactive substances. These components add to the oil's potential skin and hair care advantages. While the specific nutrient composition varies depending on factors such as the source and extraction process, the following are some of the main components commonly present in tamanu oil:
Fatty Acids:
Oleic Acid

Tamanu Oil for Dandruff: How it Works
Because of its particular blend of fatty acids, antioxidants, and bioactive components, tamanu oil is thought to have potential benefits for treating dandruff. While scientific research on the precise effects of tamanu oil on dandruff is scarce, the oil's characteristics suggest many ways in which it could help with dandruff:
Antifungal and Antimicrobial Properties
: Tamanu oil includes chemicals with antibacterial and antifungal effects, such as calophyllolide and calophyllic acid. The yeast-like fungus Malassezia overgrows on the scalp, which frequently results in dandruff.  These antimicrobial capabilities may aid in the control of this fungus and the reduction of dandruff symptoms.
Anti-Inflammatory Effects
: Scalp itchiness and irritation are frequent side effects of dandruff.  The anti-inflammatory properties of tamanu oil, attributed to substances like xanthones, may help lessen itching and redness brought on by dandruff.
Health of the Scalp and Moisturization
: Scalp dryness can make dandruff worse.  Tamanu oil includes fatty acids such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, which can help moisturise and prevent flakiness on the scalp. Furthermore, keeping a healthy scalp can help create an environment that is less favorable to dandruff production.
Support for Scalp Healing
: Tamanu oil has traditionally been used for wound healing, and its constituents, such as calophyllolide, may aid in skin cell regeneration. Tamanu oil may aid in the healing process if dandruff has caused minor skin irritation or inflammation.
Using Tamanu Oil for Dandruff:
The following is an example of how you could use tamanu oil in your routine if you are thinking about using it to treat dandruff:
Dilution
: Tamanu oil should be mixed with a carrier oil, such as coconut or jojoba oil, to lessen its concentration and stop irritation because it is frequently very potent.
Patch Test
: Before applying the diluted tamanu oil to your entire scalp, test a small area of skin for any adverse reactions or allergies.
Application
: Gently massage the diluted tamanu oil mixture into your scalp. Concentrate on the areas where dandruff is most noticeable.
Leave-in Time
: Leave the oil on your scalp for 30 minutes to an hour. You can also leave it on overnight if you are at ease.
Shampoo
: To remove the oil, use a mild, sulfate-free shampoo. Make sure to thoroughly rinse your hair to remove any oily residue.
Frequency
: Depending on your hair and scalp's needs, you can use tamanu oil as a scalp treatment a few times per week or as directed by a healthcare professional.
Anti-Dandruff Properties of Tamanu Oil
Tamanu oil is thought to have characteristics that may aid in the treatment of dandruff and its related symptoms. While scientific research on the precise effects of tamanu oil on dandruff is scarce, its components suggest multiple methods by which it may possess anti-dandruff properties:
Antifungal and Antimicrobial Effects
: Tamanu oil includes chemicals with antibacterial and antifungal effects, such as calophyllolide and calophyllic acid. These qualities could be especially beneficial in treating the yeast-like fungus Malassezia, which is commonly associated with dandruff. Tamanu oil may help reduce dandruff symptoms by inhibiting the growth of Malassezia.
Anti-Inflammatory Properties
: Dandruff is frequently accompanied by scalp inflammation, resulting in itching and flakiness. Tamanu oil includes bioactive chemicals such as xanthones, which are thought to have anti-inflammatory properties. Tamanu oil may help reduce scalp irritation and itching caused by dandruff by lowering inflammation.
Scalp Nourishment and Hydration
: Scalp dryness can aggravate dandruff. Tamanu oil's fatty acid composition, which includes oleic acid and linoleic acid, helps hydrate the scalp and prevent flakiness. A well-moisturized scalp is less prone to dandruff-causing excessive shedding of dead skin cells.
Skin Barrier Enhancement
: The components of tamanu oil may help to improve the skin's barrier function. A thicker skin barrier can shield the scalp from environmental irritants and allergens that can aggravate dandruff symptoms.
Wound Healing Properties
: Tamanu oil has long been used to treat wounds. Compounds in the oil, such as calophyllolide, may aid in skin cell regeneration, potentially facilitating the healing of minor irritations or lesions caused by dandruff scratching on the scalp.
While the anti-dandruff benefits of tamanu oil appear promising, it's important to realise that individual responses can differ. If you have a persistent or severe dandruff problem, it is best to consult a dermatologist or healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalised treatment suggestions. Tamanu oil can be used as part of a comprehensive approach to dandruff management, but it should not be used in place of medically approved treatments.
Effectiveness of Tamanu Oil Against Dandruff
Dandruff is a common scalp condition that is caused by a variety of factors, including an overgrowth of the yeast-like fungus Malassezia, dry scalp, inflammation, and others. The qualities of tamanu oil may theoretically treat some of these underlying causes, but it is important to note that individual responses to natural medicines can vary greatly. Keep the following points in mind if you're thinking about using tamanu oil for dandruff:

Personal Response
: Some people may find relief from dandruff by adopting natural therapies such as tamanu oil, while others may not see any change. Your skin type, the underlying reason for your dandruff, and your body's response to treatment might all be factors.

Frequency:
You can incorporate tamanu oil treatments into your hair care routine based on your hair's needs. This could happen once a week or as frequently as you would like.
Hair Mask
: You can also make a hair mask using tamanu oil and other nourishing ingredients like yoghurt, honey, or mashed avocado for a more intensive nourishing treatment. After applying the mask to damp hair, wait about 30 minutes before rinsing it out.
Healthy Lifestyle
: Keep in mind that your overall lifestyle has an impact on the health of your hair.  Eating a well-balanced diet, staying hydrated, and managing stress can all help to keep your hair healthy.
Professional Advice
: If you have particular hair issues, such as extreme dryness, breakage, or thinning, talk to a dermatologist or hairstylist for individualised guidance and suggestions.
