<p><b></b><span>Achieving an inner glow, as seen in celebrities, requires a combination of physical and mental well-being, self-care, and self-assurance. The latest trend among celebrities is to take bare-skin selfies. They usually pull off stunning "no-makeup" looks that make us want to love our bare skin as well.  Everything that makes your skin exclusive, including its imperfections, makes you different from everyone else around you. Nothing can make you love your skin more than it is in its natural state. This blog will provide us with some tips to help you achieve your inner glow.</span></p>
<h2><b>Skin glow of celebrities: Analysed <br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="Skin glow of celebrities: Analysed" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_3_-_2023-11-06T121750.301_480x480.png?v=1699253286"/></div>
<p><span>Many celebrities' radiant and perfect skin looks to be the product of a combination of variables, including genetics, skincare routines, professional makeup, and lifestyle choices. Celebrities, without a doubt, have an entire team to make them seem the way they do in public, most of the time all dolled up. Their employment necessitates that they always wear cosmetics, especially when they are in the public spotlight. However, celebrities all across the world are suddenly defying this rule. Genetics, skincare regimen, professional treatments, balanced food, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hyaluronic-skinbooster-serum">hydration</a>, physical activity, sleep, minimal sun exposure, makeup artistry, camera and lighting in photoshop, post-production, and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">dermatologist</a> consultation are some of the factors that contribute to celebrities' skin radiance.</span></p>
<p><span>It's essential to realise that professional styling, cosmetics, lighting, and photo manipulation can all have an impact on how people see celebrity skin. While celebrities' skin may be healthy and bright, the expectations for perfection in the entertainment industry are frequently exceedingly high. Anyone may achieve celebrity-level skin radiance with good skincare practises, a healthy lifestyle, and self-care. While you may not have the same resources as celebrities, you can still improve the health and appearance of your skin by maintaining a consistent skincare routine, eating a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and protecting your skin from sun damage.</span></p>
<h3><b>Hollywood vs. natural glow: A comparison</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Hollywood vs. natural glow: A comparison" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/117_c8b6bc1c-8799-45fd-8a18-dffaafd1dbbc_480x480.png?v=1699963671"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>The "Hollywood glow" and the "natural glow" are two techniques to achieving radiant and healthy-looking skin. Here's a side-by-side comparison:</span></p>
<h4>
<b>Hollywood Glow</b><span>:</span>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Enhanced Appearance</b><span>: The Hollywood glow is frequently achieved through the use of makeup, lighting, and professional styling to achieve a highly polished and flawless appearance. It is very common at red-carpet events and photoshoots.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Makeup</b><span>: To achieve the Hollywood glow, high-quality makeup products such as foundation, concealer, highlighters, and powders are typically used to create a smooth and luminous complexion.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Professional Techniques</b><span>: Makeup artists use a variety of techniques, such as contouring, highlighting, and strobing, to draw attention to the high points of the face, add dimension, and achieve a radiant appearance.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Lighting</b><span>: In the entertainment industry, professional lighting setups such as ring lights and softboxes are used to ensure that the skin looks flawless and glowing on camera.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Photo Editing</b><span>: Photos and videos are frequently retouched in post-production to improve the appearance of the skin by removing imperfections and blemishes.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>High-Definition Cameras</b><span>: Celebrities are frequently photographed with high-definition cameras that reveal every detail. The Hollywood glow has been optimised for such high-resolution images and videos.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<b>Natural Glow</b><span>:</span>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Natural Glow</b><span>: The natural glow emphasises genuine beauty and healthy skin.  It is about enhancing your skin's natural radiance rather than relying on makeup and lighting tricks.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skincare</b><span>: Achieving a natural glow begins with a solid skincare regimen that focuses on <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-foaming-face-wash">cleansing</a>, moisturising, exfoliating, and protecting the skin from environmental damage. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Healthy Lifestyle</b><span>: The natural glow is a result of a balanced diet, consistent exercise, drinking plenty of water, and getting enough sleep. Your skin demonstrates how well your body is nourished on the inside.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Minimal Makeup</b><span>: To achieve a natural glow, wear little to no makeup, or a "no makeup" look that draws attention to your best features without being overly dramatic. Such cosmetics include light mascara, lip balm, and tinted <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hydrasoothe-moisturiser">moisturisers</a>.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Minimal Editing</b><span>: Since the goal of natural glow photos is to capture the subject just as they are, with an emphasis on embracing imperfections, little photo retouching is usually necessary.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Daily Appearance</b><span>: The natural glow is appropriate for daily living and is not just for special occasions or picture shoots.  It is all about being at ease and self-assured in your own flesh.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Depending on the situation and your own preferences, both the Hollywood glow and natural glow have their uses. The idea is to strike a balance that works for your lifestyle while also making you feel confident and gorgeous. Some people enjoy the polished appearance of the Hollywood glow for special events, while others prefer a natural glow in everyday life. Finally, the choice between the two ways comes down to personal preference and the desired impact.</span></p>
<h3><b>Famous celebrity skincare routines </b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Famous celebrity skincare routines" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/118_e9679d4e-707a-4741-9cf8-0ad501e785a5_480x480.png?v=1699963634"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Many celebrities are known for having beautiful and glowing skin, and some have revealed information about their skincare routines and favorite products. Remember that what works for one person may not work for another and that skincare routines should be personalised to a person's skin type and issues. A physician or skincare professional should be consulted for a personalised skincare routine that fits your unique needs. Furthermore, regardless of the products and routines you use, consistency is essential to maintaining good skin.</span></p>
<h3><b> The role of diet in celebrity skin health</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="The role of diet in celebrity skin health" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/119_1f521fe6-7c25-4013-ba49-1e8b286b7965_480x480.png?v=1699963596"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Diet is important for celebrity skin health, just as it is for everyone else's. What celebrities consume can have a direct impact on the appearance, vibrancy, and overall health of their skin. Here's how diet affects the health of celebrities' skin:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Nutrient Intake</b><span>: A balanced diet full of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants is a common diet among celebrities. These nutrients are essential for maintaining a healthy complexion, preventing premature aging, and helping to repair and protect the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydration</b><span>: Maintaining adequate hydration is crucial for good skin.  Celebrities who want to keep their skin hydrated from the inside out usually drink a lot of water, herbal teas, and other hydrating drinks.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Fruits and Vegetables</b><span>: Rich in vitamins and antioxidants, celebrities frequently eat a wide range of fruits and vegetables. These foods support healthy, radiant skin by reducing oxidative stress.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Lean Proteins</b><span>: High-quality protein sources include fish, poultry, lean meats, and plant-based foods like nuts and legumes. These sources of amino acids are necessary for the synthesis of collagen and the preservation of skin elasticity.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Healthy Fats</b><span>: Avocados, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish like salmon are some of the foods that celebrities eat that are high in healthy fats. These fats are essential for skin health because they help to maintain the lipid barrier and protect the skin from external damage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Limiting Sugar and Processed Foods</b><span>: Celebrities frequently avoid or limit their intake of high-sugar and processed foods, which can contribute to inflammation, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-the-ultimate-nia-10-niacinamide-serum">acne</a>, and premature skin aging.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Omega-3 Fatty Acids</b><span>: Foods high in <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/omega-3-fatty-acid-skin-benefits">omega-3</a> fatty acids, such as fatty fish and flaxseeds, can help reduce inflammation and improve skin health.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Collagen-Boosting Foods</b><span>: Some celebrities consume collagen-boosting foods such as bone broth and foods high in <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-vitamin-c3-serum">vitamin C</a>, which is required for collagen synthesis.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Anti-Inflammatory Foods</b><span>: Celebrities may consume anti-inflammatory foods such as turmeric and green tea, which can help manage skin conditions and reduce redness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Supplements</b><span>: Some celebrities may take skin-health supplements such as vitamin C, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/vitamin-e-skincare-benefits">vitamin E</a>, and omega-3 fatty acids, particularly if their diet lacks adequate amounts of these nutrients.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It is worth noting that celebrities frequently have access to nutritionists and personal chefs who can assist them in planning and preparing well-balanced meals tailored to their specific needs. While a celebrity's diet can be motivating, it is important to remember that the principles of healthy eating apply to everyone.  Maintaining a balanced diet rich in nutrient-rich foods, staying hydrated, and avoiding processed and sugary foods can all help to improve skin health and overall well-being.</span></p>

<h2><b>How to get glowing skin like the celebrities<br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="How to get glowing skin like the celebrities" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_3_-_2023-11-06T122255.990_480x480.png?v=1699253598"/></div>
<p><span>The celebrities have something in common that makes them glow the way they do. All the celebrities who dare to pull off no-makeup looks are the ones who radiate from the inside out. They don't achieve this look overnight. They achieve it with consistency and determination. Along with a good skincare routine, healthy food habits, eight hours of sleep, and sufficient water intake, you can surely achieve the celebrity skin you have been longing for. But sometimes it’s not possible to wholly achieve your skincare goals even after doing all these things diligently. This is because your state of mind has a significant role to play in that. It's essential to take time for yourself. It could mean going to the beach, soaking yourself in the sun, gardening, doing yoga, or binge-watching a series on Netflix. If this is what you have wanted to do for a long time, take the time to do it! Don't procrastinate. This might be precisely what your skin needs.</span></p>
<h3><b>Topical treatments vs. natural remedies </b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Topical treatments vs. natural remedies" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/116_b60ebbef-3fe4-44e2-8ef7-188043e0aff1_480x480.png?v=1699962090"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Topical treatments and natural cures are two techniques of skincare that can be selected based on personal preferences and skin issues. Each strategy has advantages and disadvantages:</span></p>
<h4>
<b>Topical Treatments</b><span>:</span>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Efficacy</b><span>: Topical treatments frequently contain active substances that have been clinically evaluated and shown to be useful in treating certain skin conditions. They can offer tailored remedies for issues such as acne, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-skin-renewer-retinol-serum">fine lines and wrinkles</a>, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">hyperpigmentation</a>, and others.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consistency</b><span>: Topical treatments are available in a variety of formulas, including creams, serums, and gels, making it easier to stick to a consistent skincare programme.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Quick Results</b><span>: Some topical treatments may produce relatively quick results, which can be advantageous for those seeking rapid skin improvement.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Dermatologist Recommendations</b><span>: Dermatologists frequently prescribe or recommend topical treatments for a variety of skin conditions, ensuring that you receive the most appropriate and effective treatment options.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Customization</b><span>: Topical treatments enable you to address individual needs by being suited to your particular skin type and concerns.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<b>Natural Remedies</b><span>:</span>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Minimal Chemical Exposure</b><span>: Natural remedies typically use natural ingredients, reducing exposure to potentially harmful chemicals commonly found in commercial skincare products.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Minimal Side Effects</b><span>: People with sensitive or reactive skin may find that natural remedies are less likely to cause side effects and are gentler on the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>DIY Options</b><span>: Many natural remedies can be made at home, making them a more cost-effective and sustainable option for skincare.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Holistic Approach</b><span>: Natural remedies frequently align with a holistic approach to health and beauty, emphasising overall well-being, a healthy lifestyle, and natural ingredients.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Prevention and Maintenance</b><span>: Natural treatments can help prevent common skin problems like dryness and inflammation as well as provide general skin maintenance.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>The importance of hydration for radiant skin</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="The importance of hydration for radiant skin" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/115_901a1335-f69e-4193-b3e0-3f66da6ec111_480x480.png?v=1699962626"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>In order to achieve and maintain healthy, glowing skin, proper hydration is crucial. The following are some main arguments for why maintaining adequate hydration is essential for the health and appearance of your skin:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Moisture Barrier</b><span>: The stratum corneum, the outermost layer of your skin, serves as a barrier to stop moisture loss. This barrier works best to keep your skin hydrated and shield it from the elements when it is properly hydrated.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydrated Skin Glows</b><span>: Skin that is well-hydrated looks more youthful, smooth, and glowing. Proper hydration gives your skin a natural glow and helps to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Prevents Dryness</b><span>: Dry, flaky, and itchy skin can result from dehydration. Adequate hydration helps to prevent these problems and keeps the skin smooth and comfortable.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reduces Dullness</b><span>: Dehydrated skin can appear dull and lifeless. Hydrated skin reflects light more effectively, making it appear more vibrant and youthful.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Even Skin Tone</b><span>: Proper hydration can aid in the maintenance of an even skin tone as well as the reduction of redness and blotchiness. It can also help with the recovery of skin conditions such as <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/eczema">eczema</a> and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/rosacea">psoriasis</a>.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Faster Wound Healing</b><span>: Hydrated skin heals faster and more effectively. Moisture promotes the skin's natural healing processes and aids in the repair of damage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Improved Elasticity</b><span>: Hydrated skin is more elastic and resilient.  It can withstand stretching and movement better, lowering the risk of stretch marks and sagging.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Wrinkle Prevention</b><span>: Hydrated skin is less likely to develop fine lines and wrinkles. Maintaining proper moisture levels helps to keep skin elasticity and flexibility.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reduces Acne</b><span>: Despite popular belief, even oily and acne-prone skin requires hydration. Hydrated skin is less likely to produce excessive oil to compensate for dehydration, lowering the risk of acne breakouts.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sun Protection</b><span>: Skin that is properly hydrated is more resistant to UV damage. It can withstand the sun's harmful rays and reduce the risk of <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-sunprotect-sunscreen-spf-50">sunburn</a> and skin aging.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><b>Skin-friendly foods to incorporate</b></h4>
<p><span>Skin-friendly meals can assist you in achieving and maintaining healthy, vibrant skin. Here are some nutrient-dense foods that can help with skin health:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Berries (blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries), leafy greens (spinach and kale), carrots, and tomatoes are examples of fruits and vegetables.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Salmon, mackerel, and sardines are examples of fatty fish.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Almonds, walnuts, and flaxseeds are examples of nuts and seeds. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Avocado is high in healthy fats and vitamin E, both of which help to keep the skin moisturised and protected.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Oatmeal, quinoa, and brown rice are examples of whole grains.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Chicken, turkey, and tofu are examples of lean proteins.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Dairy or dairy substitutes such as Greek yoghurt and fortified plant-based substitutes (e.g., almond or soy yoghurt)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Green tea, for example, is high in antioxidants and polyphenols, which protect the skin from damage and inflammation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Staying hydrated is essential for maintaining skin moisture and overall health.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Dark chocolate (70% cocoa or higher) is an example of cocoa.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Turmeric has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that can help your skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Oranges, grapefruits, and lemons are examples of citrus fruits.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Eggs contain biotin and protein, which help to maintain healthy skin,healthy hair, and nails.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Red and yellow bell peppers are high in vitamin C and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/the-power-of-beta-carotene-in-skincare">beta-carotene</a>, both of which are good for skin health.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Papaya contains papain, an enzyme that can aid in the removal of dead skin cells and the improvement of skin texture.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Incorporating these skin-friendly items into your diet will improve the appearance and overall health of your skin. Remember that a varied and balanced diet rich in a variety of nutrients is essential for glowing and healthy skin. Individual nutritional needs may also differ, so seek personalised guidance from a healthcare practitioner or a qualified dietitian.</span></p>
<h2><b>Consult dermatologists for expert advice<br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="Consult dermatologists for expert advice" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_3_-_2023-11-06T122747.217_480x480.png?v=1699253885"/></div>
<p><span>The trendiest one out of all the looks celebrities wear remains where they flaunt their nourished skin without any makeup. That's their most authentic self, and it's inspiring. Everyone reading this article would agree that a dewy-fresh look is way better than a glammed-up face full of makeup. Celebrities somehow carry that look like a boss! It's a myth that they never seem troubled by skin problems like acne, pigmentation, uneven spots on the skin, aging, hair fall, etc. Like all other human beings, celebrities also struggle with the basic skin problems mentioned above. They just choose to take care of their skin, have access to the best-in-class skincare products and treatments, and follow their skincare regimens consistently. Consistency is the key to achieving anything. Be consistent with your skincare, and you too will indeed have the skin of your dreams—the kind your favorite celebrity has! Celebrity-like skin is possible, but you must work hard to get it.</span></p>
<h3><b>Skin Assessment</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Skin Assessment" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/81_b7b3b9d7-8034-4428-bf8c-edee066b93b1_480x480.png?v=1699950080"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>A skin assessment is an examination of your skin's state and health. It is often performed by a dermatologist or a skincare specialist and can assist in determining your skin type, identifying any specific skin concerns or disorders, and providing personalised skincare and treatment recommendations. A skin assessment typically consists of the following steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Skin Type Identification</b><span>: The evaluation begins with determining your skin type, which can be normal, dry, oily, combination, sensitive, or mature. Your skin type influences skincare recommendations.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skin Concerns</b><span>: You will discuss any specific skin concerns you have, such as acne, rosacea, hyperpigmentation, eczema, or signs of ageing. This information allows the professional to tailor recommendations to your specific needs.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Medical History</b><span>: You'll tell us about your medical history, including any previous or present skin disorders, allergies, medications, and previous skincare treatments.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Lifestyle and Habits</b><span>: The professional may inquire about your daily skincare routine, diet, water intake, sun exposure, smoking habits, and stress levels. Lifestyle choices can have a significant impact on the health of your skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Examination</b><span>: The professional will examine your skin to determine its overall condition. They may use specialised tools to examine the texture, hydration levels, elasticity, and signs of damage or aging on your skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Recommendations</b><span>: The dermatologist or skincare professional will make personalised recommendations based on the information gathered during the assessment. This could include skincare product recommendations, treatments, lifestyle changes, and sun protection. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Treatment Plan</b><span>: If you have specific skin concerns, the professional may develop a treatment plan for you that may include prescription medications, topical treatments, procedures, or a customised skincare routine.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Preventive Measures</b><span>: You will be advised on preventive measures to maintain the health of your skin, such as sun protection, healthy diet choices, and stress management.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Follow-Up Appointments</b><span>: Depending on your skin concerns, you may be scheduled for follow-up appointments to monitor progress and, if necessary, adjust the treatment plan.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>To receive an accurate evaluation and customised recommendations, it is crucial to speak with a licenced dermatologist or skincare specialist.  You can preserve and gradually enhance the look and health of your skin with regular skin examinations.</span></p>
<h3><b>Is makeup really effective? </b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Is makeup really effective?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/114_a66a8f37-91ad-433f-bc1a-f0ad3ef88736_480x480.png?v=1699962734"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Makeup can be extremely effective in enhancing your appearance, concealing flaws, and creating the desired look. It is a treat to the eyes to see so many celebrities posting pictures of themselves without any makeup on. Celebrities are now not scared of posting content on social media where they are not pretending to be someone else. Some share a naturally glowing face post a workout, some share a post-pregnancy look, some share a sun-kissed one, and some of them share a well-moisturised one. Celebrities are no longer conscious of flaunting their natural looks without makeup. Fresh faces are in as celebrities are on a spree to ditch their foundation and powder. No makeup looks are going viral. Celebrities like Sonam Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor have taken the media and their fans by surprise by showing that celebrities are not perfect. They have beautifully embraced their imperfections.</span></p>
<h3><b>Skin glow is really skin deep </b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Skin glow is really skin deep" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/113_ebbcbc5d-3050-4937-b253-6bbe10c43742_480x480.png?v=1699962768"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>The expression "skin deep" is frequently used to emphasise that a person's beauty and genuine essence extend beyond outward appearance. It implies that the traits that genuinely characterise a person, such as character, personality, kindness, and inner beauty, are more essential than superficial characteristics such as skin color. While a healthy and glowing complexion is attractive, it does not determine a person's worth or character.</span></p>
<p><span>Celebrity red carpet-looks have always been a thing! But what we don’t know is that a lot of work goes into making them look the way they do on the red carpet.  Instead of trying to achieve a celebrity's red-carpet look, try achieving the one in which celebrities show their truest selves in front of the camera - the one without any makeup on. There's absolutely nothing wrong with makeup. On the contrary, there is something compelling about using the right kind of makeup - the one that suits you, be it the perfect red lipstick or well-done smokey eyes. But loving your true self pretty much has the same power, or maybe more.</span></p>
<h3><b>Healthy mind leads to healthy skin </b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Healthy mind leads to healthy skin" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/112_b8553f59-3fa3-46ea-835a-36aad1ea33ee_480x480.png?v=1699962798"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Your state of mind has a significant role to play in how you look. A calm mental space makes you feel good, reflecting a glow on your face. On the other hand, if you're stressed, haven't slept well, have been consuming too much caffeine, and haven't been working out, it will show on your face. You'll probably look dull and tired. Therefore, it's vital to be happy on the outside and on the inside. If you're in a good place mentally, it most certainly shows on your skin. You'll look well-rested and radiant. That glow everyone runs after doesn't only come with makeup or exercise. It can only be achieved with a whole lot of consistency and effort.</span></p>
<p><span>The link between a healthy mind and a healthy body is widely known. Your mental and emotional wellness can have a big impact on the health and appearance of your skin. Stress reduction, balanced hormones, better sleep, confidence and self-esteem, emotional balance, good lifestyle choices, reduced skin-picking and scratching, improved healing, and preventative actions are some of the ways a healthy mind can contribute to healthy skin.
