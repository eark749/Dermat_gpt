If hair fall is a concern or worry for you, then your grandmother's old routine of a coconut oil massage can be the answer - as long as it's done right! Using coconut oil for hair growth has been prevalent for centuries. Since it comes from dried and raw coconuts, it is one of the best ways to reduce hair fall naturally and at home.
Many individuals use coconut oil as a popular and natural solution to increase hair development and maintain hair health. While it may not be suitable for everyone, there is some anecdotal and little scientific data that suggests coconut oil can be beneficial to hair. This blog explains how to use coconut oil for possible
hair growth
benefits.
What is virgin coconut oil?
Virgin coconut oil for hair is far different from regular coconut oil. The major difference between the two lies in the processes of extraction and manufacturing. Virgin coconut oil is obtained from fresh coconut milk. This makes it effective for reducing hair fall and other types of hair damage. Since virgin coconut oil is made using cold-pressed technology, it helps eliminate the need for heating before application. This helps retain the chemical composition and natural goodness of regular coconut oil. If you are using virgin coconut oil, care should be taken not to expose it to sunlight, as it can alter its composition and structure.
Does coconut oil reduce hair fall?
Dermatologists agree that if you have thinning or even
damaged hair
, then applying coconut oil to your hair and scalp can be extremely helpful. Coconut oil penetrates your hair shafts with no risk of protein loss. Thus, it helps to nourish and strengthen the hair structure. It also helps to lower friction, thus preventing hair fall due to hair damage and breakage.
It is important to note that the effectiveness of coconut oil for hair loss varies from person to person. Some people may find great benefits, while others may not see any major improvements. Furthermore, using coconut oil for hair loss should be part of a comprehensive hair care regimen that includes a healthy diet, proper hair care practises, and addressing any underlying health conditions that may be contributing to hair loss.
It is advisable to speak with a dermatologist or other healthcare provider if you are experiencing excessive hair loss or have concerns about hair fall. They can offer recommendations for suitable treatments or interventions and assist in identifying the underlying causes of your hair loss.
How to apply coconut oil on hair and scalp
Coating the hair in coconut oil after washing helps make the hair smoother and softer. But for best results, experts recommend to apply coconut oil for hair fall in the following ways:
What You Will Need
: Virgin or extra virgin coconut oil, A small bowl or container for warming the oil (optional), and a wide-tooth comb (optional)
Steps:
Choose the Best Coconut Oil
: Look for high-quality virgin or extra virgin coconut oil. These coconut oils have been minimally processed and thus retain more of their natural nutrients.
Warm the Coconut Oil (Optional)
: Coconut oil is solid at normal temperature, but you can gradually warm it to a liquid form if you want. Place the container of coconut oil in a basin of warm water or microwave it for a few seconds. Take care not to overheat the oil, as this can ruin some of its therapeutic properties.
Section Your Hair (Optional)
: If you have long or thick hair, sectioning it can help with even oil distribution.  Make manageable sections with clips or hair ties.
Apply to Scalp
: Apply the coconut oil to your scalp with your fingers.  Begin by parting your hair and applying the oil directly to your scalp, working it into the roots. You can also use a small brush or an applicator bottle for precise application.
Massage the Scalp
: Apply a small amount of coconut oil to your scalp by making circular movements with your fingertips.  Massage your scalp to increase blood circulation and hair growth. Massage for a further 5-10 minutes.
Apply to Hair
: After you have covered your scalp, work the remaining coconut oil through the length of your hair. If your hair is especially dry or damaged, concentrate on the ends.
Comb Through (Optional)
: Use a wide-tooth comb to distribute the oil evenly through your hair and detangle any knots.  This step is optional, but it can help ensure that the oil is distributed evenly.
Wrap Your Hair (Optional)
: To keep the oil from dripping and to allow it to penetrate your hair and scalp, wear a shower cap or a warm, damp towel over your head.
Leave it on
: Leave the coconut oil on your hair and scalp for at least 30 minutes, but you can also leave it on overnight for a more intensive treatment.  Consider using a towel or a hair wrap to protect your pillow while sleeping.
Shampoo and Rinse
: After the specified time, thoroughly
shampoo
your hair to remove the oil.  You may need to shampoo more than once to remove all of the oil. If desired, apply conditioner after.
Towel Dry
: Gently towel dry your hair, then style as usual. After using coconut oil, you may notice that your hair feels softer and appears shinier.
You can use coconut oil as a hair treatment once a week or as needed, depending on the condition of your hair and your preferences. You may notice changes in the texture, strength, and overall health of your hair and scalp over time.
Your "Magic Elixir": Coconut oil for hair loss
Coconut oil is indeed a Magic Elixir for your hair. The benefits of coconut oil for hair can never be ignored, and it is one of the best moisturisers for your hair. The before and after results of using coconut oil are truly surprising. Applying coconut oil will help to maintain the natural shine of your hair. While it may not be suitable for everyone, there are several reasons why coconut oil is thought to be beneficial for those wishing to address hair loss or promote hair growth:
Nourishment
: Lauric acid, one of the medium-chain fatty acids found in coconut oil, can enter the hair shaft and supply vital nutrients.  This nutrient helps fortify hair, reducing its vulnerability to breakage and loss.
Hair Protein Loss
: Research has indicated that coconut oil can help hair retain more protein. Hair is mostly made up of a protein called keratin, so preventing protein loss can help maintain structural integrity and reduce damage.
Moisturization
: The ability of the oil to moisturise and condition the hair and scalp can help to prevent
dry scalp
, flakiness, and breakage, all of which contribute to hair loss.
Improved Scalp Health
: A healthy scalp is necessary for hair growth.  By reducing
dandruff
, itchiness, and inflammation, coconut oil can help maintain scalp health.
Antifungal Properties
: If left untreated, fungal infections on the scalp can lead to hair loss. Coconut oil's antifungal properties can help combat these infections.
Increased Blood Circulation
: Massaging coconut oil into the scalp can increase blood circulation, potentially stimulating hair follicles and encouraging hair growth.

The Nutritional Profile of Coconut Oil
Coconut oil is mostly made up of fats and is a good source of a variety of fatty acids. The nutritional profile of coconut oil per 1 tablespoon (about 14 grammes) is as follows:
Calories
: 120 calories
Fats
: Coconut oil is primarily composed of fats. Approximately 12 grammes of saturated fat (nearly 90% of total fat content). The saturated fat in coconut oil is mostly made up of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), the most prominent of which is lauric acid.
No Protein or Carbohydrates
: Coconut oil contains very little protein and carbohydrates.
Vitamins and minerals
: Coconut oil contains very few vitamins and minerals. It has trace amounts of
vitamin E
and
vitamin K
.
Phytonutrients
: Coconut oil may contain trace amounts of
antioxidants
, such as phenolic compounds, which have health benefits.
Because of its high-fat content, particularly saturated fat, coconut oil is high in calories. While part of the saturated fats in coconut oil is medium-chain fatty acids, which are metabolised differently than long-chain fatty acids present in many animal fats, you should still limit your consumption of coconut oil. When used in moderation, coconut oil can be a healthy choice, but excessive intake can lead to weight gain and potentially negative effects on heart health.
Consider using coconut oil as a cooking oil in moderation or as a flavor enhancer in various dishes when incorporating it into your diet. Furthermore, while coconut oil has some health benefits, it should be part of a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-rich foods.
Addressing Common Misconceptions about Coconut Oil for Hair
Coconut oil has grown in popularity as a natural hair care solution; however, there are several common misconceptions regarding its use that must be addressed:
Coconut Oil for All Hair Types
: While coconut oil is beneficial to many hair types, it may not be appropriate for everyone. People with fine or
thin hair
may find that coconut oil weighs it down and makes it look greasy. It is important to evaluate your hair type and its requirements.
Overnight Treatments Are Always Better
: It's usual to leave coconut oil on your hair overnight, but it's not for everyone. Some people may find that applying the product for a shorter period of time, such as 30 minutes to a few hours, delivers the same advantages without leaving their hair overly oily.
Coconut Oil is a Cure-All for Hair Loss
: Coconut oil can help strengthen and repair hair, but it is not a cure for hair loss caused by genetics or medical conditions. If you are experiencing significant
hair loss
, you should see a doctor right away.
Coconut Oil Can Repair Split Ends
: Coconut oil can temporarily hide split ends by adding moisture and smoothing the hair. It cannot, however, repair or permanently repair split ends. Split ends are best addressed through regular haircuts.
More is Better
: Using too much coconut oil can make your hair look greasy and weighed down. Begin with a small amount and gradually increase based on your hair's needs and type.
Coconut Oil Can Replace Conditioner
: While coconut oil is a great natural conditioner, it may not be suitable for everyone as a sole replacement for traditional
hair conditioner
. Both are beneficial to many different hair types.
Immediate Results
: Some people may not see immediate results from coconut oil. The key is consistency, and it may take several applications to see improvements in hair health and appearance.
One-Size-Fits-All
: What works for one person may not work for another. The effectiveness of coconut oil for hair varies depending on individual factors such as hair type, condition, and specific needs.
Addressing All Hair Issues
: Coconut oil is not a panacea for all hair problems. While it can help with dryness, damage, and dandruff, it may not be the best solution for every hair problem.
Coconut Oil in Traditional Hair Care Practices
Coconut oil has been used in traditional hair care practises in numerous cultures for ages. Its diverse and natural features make it a popular choice for supporting healthy and beautiful hair. Traditional uses of coconut oil for hair care include hair conditioning, hair growth, dandruff management, preventing hair damage, lice treatment, natural hair styling, hair masks,
sun protection
, and traditional hair oiling rituals. While coconut oil is a diverse and natural solution for hair care, its effectiveness as a
hair oil
varies from person to person. What works for one person could not work for another, depending on hair type and personal needs.
When incorporating coconut oil into your hair care routine, keep your hair type, problems, and preferences in mind. In order to obtain and retain the intended effects, you must also be consistent in your usage. If you have specific hair concerns or problems, a dermatologist or hair care professional can provide tailored advice and recommendations.
Benefits of coconut oil for hair

sensitive skin
, and it will also allow easy scalp care.

And yes, it prevents hair loss
! Massaging your hair shaft using warm coconut oil can be highly beneficial for preventing hair loss, and it will ensure that the hair is in good condition. Coconut oil is also rich in nutrients that promote good hair health.
Utilising coconut oil is crucial when following a well-rounded hair care regimen that takes into consideration the needs and types of your particular hair. While coconut oil is beneficial to many people, its effectiveness varies from person to person. Furthermore, consistency in application is frequently critical to achieving and maintaining the desired results for your hair.
Other hair oils vs. coconut oil for hair growth
Unlike sunflower oil and mineral oil, coconut oil acts mainly through Lauric acid, which is absorbed deeper into the scalp. So, coconut oil is much more effective when it comes to preventing protein loss and promoting healthy hair growth. In fact, coconut oil proved just as effective on bleached, UV-exposed, or sun-damaged hair.
Step #1: Heating coconut oil for hair helps!
Many people consider heating coconut oil before applying it to the scalp. Applying coconut oil to your hair after heating aids in moisturising your hair follicles and promoting healthy hair growth. Furthermore, it also helps prevent any unwanted buildup across the scalp. Heated coconut oil also contains the necessary fatty acids and vitamins. They provide additional nourishment to the scalp by penetrating through the hair's cuticle, thus making it stronger.
How to heat coconut oil for hair
: Put a teaspoon of oil in a bowl and heat it with hot tap water. Make sure not to overheat the coconut oil, as doing so will destroy the fatty acids. Heating coconut oil before applying it to your hair can be advantageous for a number of reasons, including:
Improved Penetration
: Coconut oil is generally solid at ambient temperature, however, warming it can turn it into a liquid. This makes it easy to apply and distribute evenly throughout your hair and scalp, ensuring that the oil can penetrate and moisturise efficiently.
Improved Absorption
: The beneficial nutrients in warmed coconut oil can be better utilised because the hair shaft and scalp can absorb them more readily.
Relaxing Experience
: Gently warming and massaging warm coconut oil into your scalp and hair can be a soothing and relaxing experience that promotes well-being and reduces stress.
Make sure the warmed coconut oil is at a comfortable temperature before applying it to your hair and scalp. It should be warm but not hot enough to burn your skin or scalp. Always test a small area of skin with a patch test to ensure it is not overly hot or unpleasant.
Step #2: Apply coconut oil on hair
Applying coconut oil to your hair is a popular and natural way to nourish and condition your hair. The best way to apply coconut oil is from the midsection of the hair to prevent any damage. If you want to promote hair growth, it is advisable to use small amounts of coconut oil and massage it using your fingertips.
Apply coconut oil to your scalp and massage thoroughly.
Use a wide-toothed comb to distribute the coconut oil evenly and thoroughly.
Leave it on for about 30 minutes, or even overnight, before finally washing it off with a mild shampoo.
If you have dry hair, then using a combination of heated olive oil with coconut oil will help reduce hair dryness. You can also combine coconut oil with lemon juice, honey, or yoghurt to maximize the results for healthy hair growth.
For best results, you should use coconut oil for your hair and scalp twice a week, or even every night if you want!
You can use coconut oil as a hair treatment once a week or as needed, depending on the condition of your hair and your preferences. You may notice changes in the texture, strength, and overall health of your hair and scalp over time.
Step #3: Wash it off using a mild shampoo
Yes, you should use a gentle shampoo to remove the coconut oil from your hair and scalp. When using coconut oil for hair growth, you must use a mild shampoo. If you have used coconut oil as a hair mask, you must use a mild shampoo. You can wrap a shower cap around it to prevent the oil from damaging your pillow. To get rid of coconut oil, you should consider rinsing your hair a few times. As a result, you will end up having silky and soft hair. Here are the steps for properly removing coconut oil from your hair:
Shampoo Selection
: Select a mild, sulfate-free shampoo that is appropriate for your hair type.  Sulfate-free shampoos are gentler on the hair and scalp, and they do not remove as many natural oils.
Warm Water Rinse
: Before using shampoo, rinse your hair with warm water.  The warm water softens and emulsifies the coconut oil, making it easier to remove.
Apply Shampoo
: Lather a small amount of your preferred mild shampoo in your hands.  Massage the shampoo gently into your scalp and through the length of your hair.  Focus on the areas where you applied the coconut oil.
Thoroughly Rinse
: Rinse your hair with lukewarm water, making sure to remove all of the shampoo and oil.  If your hair still feels oily or greasy after the first wash, you may need to repeat this step.
Conditioner (Optional)
: If you normally use conditioner, apply it only to the ends of your hair.  Avoid applying it to your scalp or hair roots, as they may contain residual coconut oil.
Final Rinse
: After allowing the conditioner to sit for a minute or two, rinse your hair with cool or lukewarm water one last time.  Close the hair cuticles with cool water to make your hair look shinier.
Towel Dry
: Gently pat your hair with a towel to remove excess moisture.  Rubbing too vigorously can cause hair breakage.
Style as Normally
: Style your hair as usual, whether by air-drying, blow-drying, or using other styling tools.
After rinsing with coconut oil, you may notice that your hair feels softer, smoother, and shinier. The oil treatment can help enhance the overall health and appearance of your hair. This method can be used as part of your hair care routine, but the frequency of application should be determined by your specific hair needs and preferences.
Combining Coconut Oil with Other Essential Oils

see a dermatologist
. They can diagnose your condition, recommend appropriate treatments, and ensure that it is not a more serious scalp disorder.
While coconut oil can help many people with dandruff and scalp issues, it may not work for everyone. The outcome depends on the underlying causes of the scalp condition. Furthermore, including coconut oil in a comprehensive hair care routine, along with proper hygiene and a balanced diet, can contribute to a healthier scalp and hair.
Importance of Using Unrefined, Pure Coconut Oil
When opposed to refined coconut oil, using unrefined, pure coconut oil, also known as virgin or extra virgin coconut oil, has several significant advantages. Here are some of the main reasons why unrefined, pure coconut oil is recommended for a variety of applications, including hair and skin care:
Preservation of Nutrients
: Unrefined coconut oil is processed as little as possible, which helps to maintain the natural nutrients found in coconuts. It keeps its natural flavor and aroma, as well as its nutritious value, which includes vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. These nutrients can help your hair and skin.
High Lauric Acid Content
: Unrefined coconut oil is high in lauric acid, a medium-chain fatty acid with antimicrobial properties.  Lauric acid is known for its ability to fight bacteria, viruses, and fungi, making it useful for maintaining skin and scalp health.
Effective Moisturization
: The natural composition of unrefined coconut oil makes it an excellent moisturiser for the skin and hair.  It helps to retain moisture, prevents dryness, and promotes softness and smoothness.
Better Hair Condition
: Unrefined coconut oil has the ability to enter the hair shaft and supply vital nutrients, strengthening the hair, lowering protein loss, and minimising damage.  It is especially helpful for people whose hair is brittle, dry, or damaged.
Gentle on the Skin
: Unrefined coconut oil is less likely to irritate skin or trigger allergic reactions because of its purity.  It is frequently used as a natural treatment for a variety of skin conditions, including sensitive skin.
Antioxidant Properties
: Antioxidants found in unrefined coconut oil aid in the fight against free radicals, which can cause damage and aging to the skin. These antioxidants may lessen the appearance of
wrinkles and fine lines
while also promoting healthy skin.
Natural Flavour and Aroma
: The unrefined coconut oil keeps the distinctive flavor and aroma of coconuts.  This can be advantageous if coconut oil is being used in cooking or if cosmetic products contain its natural scent.
Various Uses
: Unrefined coconut oil is multipurpose and can be used for cooking, skin and hair care, and even as an essential oil carrier.
No Chemical Additives
: Chemical additives, bleaching agents, or deodorising procedures that are sometimes used in the refinement of other coconut oils are absent from unrefined coconut oil.  It is regarded as a more organic and unadulterated choice.
It's essential to remember that the label "virgin" or "extra virgin" for coconut oil is not standardised like it is for olive oil, therefore it might differ between companies. Look for reliable manufacturers that expressly declare their coconut oil is unprocessed, cold-pressed, or extracted using a mechanical technique to ensure you are obtaining a pure, unrefined product. When you use unrefined coconut oil for your hair, skin, or cooking, you may maximise the natural characteristics and nutrients it contains.
Best Practices for Storing Coconut Oil
Coconut oil must be stored properly to maintain its quality and prevent it from becoming rancid. Keep it sealed, store it in a cool place, avoid refrigeration, prevent contamination, check for spoilage signs, use smaller containers, keep it away from strong odors, use a dark container, label the container, rotate stock, and buy high-quality brands. Proper storage and management of coconut oil can help retain its quality and prevent deterioration. When stored properly, coconut oil can have a long shelf life, often 1 to 2 years or more, depending on numerous conditions. To ensure you're utilising a fresh and safe product, be on the lookout for signs of spoilage and discard any coconut oil that has gone bad.
Do's and Don’ts: Coconut Oil Hair Treatment
There are specific do's and don'ts to keep in mind when using coconut oil for hair care to achieve the greatest results and minimise any complications. Here are some pointers to keep in mind:
Do's
:
Start with Clean, Dry Hair
: Make sure your hair is clean and dry before applying coconut oil. This allows the oil to enter deeper into the hair and scalp.
Use Unrefined, Pure Coconut Oil
: For the greatest benefits for your hair, use unrefined, pure coconut oil (extra virgin or virgin).  It is less processed and still has its original qualities.
Warm the Coconut Oil
: Before using, slowly reheat the coconut oil until it becomes liquid.  This guarantees even coverage and facilitates distribution.
Split Your Hair
: To ensure that you can apply the oil evenly and reach every part of your scalp and hair, split your long or thick hair into sections.
Massage into Scalp
: Apply the coconut oil to your scalp with circular motions using your fingertips.  This may aid in enhancing blood flow and encouraging hair development.
Focus on the Ends
: If your hair is dry and damaged, pay particular attention to the ends of it.  Breakage and split ends can both be avoided with the use of coconut oil.
Cover Your Hair
: To help the oil absorb more fully, you can cover your hair with a warm towel or shower cap after you have applied it.  If you want an intense treatment, you can leave it on overnight or for at least thirty minutes.
Shampoo Completely
: To completely remove the coconut oil, use a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo.  It is possible that you will need to shampoo twice to remove all of the oil.
Apply on a regular basis
: For best results, use coconut oil as a hair treatment on a regular basis, ideally once a week or as needed based on the condition and preferences of your hair.
Don'ts
:
Don't Apply to Wet Hair
: Coconut oil works best on dry hair. Wet hair can form a barrier that prevents the oil from penetrating efficiently.
Don't Overheat the Oil
: When warming coconut oil, take care not to overheat it, since it can become too hot to comfortably apply. Warm it gradually in short intervals over a double boiler or in the microwave.
Don't Use Excessive Amounts
: For hair treatment, you don't need to use a lot of coconut oil. A little goes a long way, and using too much might make it difficult to remove.
Don't Leave It On Too Long
: While overnight treatments might be useful, putting coconut oil on your hair for long periods of time, especially in hot conditions, can cause oiliness and make your hair seem greasy. Find a time frame that works for you.
Do not forget to Shampoo
: Shampooing your hair is essential for thoroughly removing the coconut oil. If you don't, you will look greasy and unwashed.
Do not Ignore Allergies
: If you have allergies or sensitivities to coconut or coconut oil, avoid using it on your hair or skin.  Perform a patch test if you're unsure about potential allergies.
Do not Forget About Your Hair Care Routine
: While coconut oil can be beneficial, it is not a replacement for your regular hair care routine.  Continue to use your regular shampoo and conditioner.
You can make the most of your coconut oil hair treatment and enjoy the benefits it provides for your hair and scalp by following these dos and don'ts.
