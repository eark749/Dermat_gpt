Excessive hair loss can be a worry, but there are things you can do to overcome this problem and promote healthy hair. This blog helps you understand the possible causes and effective treatments.
Understanding the Causes of Severe Hair Fall
Most healthy people shed up to 100 strands of hair each day. As part of the hair growth cycle, new strands emerge to replace those removed.
Alopecia
(hair loss) is when you shed more strands and fewer or none grow back. There are various types of
hair loss
, and it can affect adults of any gender, including children. You may lose hair on your head or all over your body.
Common Reasons for Extreme Hair Loss
Numerous factors can contribute to hair loss. The most prevalent are the following:
Hereditary hair loss due to genetics.
A scalp infection caused by fungi.
Tight ponytails, hair extensions, and braids are examples of hairstyles that pull the hair tightly.
Haircare products that include bleach and perms that may damage hair owing to processing.
Hormonal changes (for example, pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause).
Medical treatment (for example, chemotherapy and certain medications).
Nutritional deficiencies (the most important thing is the deficiency of iron and protein).
Stressful events (like having surgery or losing a loved one).
Thyroid disease.
Medical Conditions That Cause Hair Fall
Hormonal Imbalances
: Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can cause hair loss. Thyroid hormones regulate
hair growth
, and abnormalities can disrupt the cycle. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal condition in women that causes hair thinning. Hormonal changes during menopause, particularly a drop in estrogen levels, can cause hair loss.
Autoimmune Diseases
: Autoimmune illness targets hair follicles, causing patchy hair loss on the scalp and other parts of the body. Lupus-related hair loss can be spotty or widespread. Another autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland and can result in hair thinning and loss.
Nutritional Deficiencies
: Low iron levels can cause hair thinning and loss. Iron is required to produce hemoglobin, which transports oxygen to the hair follicles. Vitamin D plays a vital role in the hair follicle cycle, and its deficiency can lead to hair loss. Biotin is needed for healthy hair growth.
Chronic Illnesses
: Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to poor blood circulation and limit oxygen supply to the scalp, resulting in hair loss. Chronic renal disease can cause nutrient and hormone imbalances that influence hair growth, resulting in hair loss. Liver diseases can affect the balance of hormones and nutrients, resulting in hair thinning and loss.
Scalp Infections and Conditions
: Fungal diseases, such as tinea capitis (scalp ringworm), can cause patchy hair loss. These infections are treated with antifungal medicines. The common scalp condition characterized by irritation,  flaking, and itching,, which can lead to hair thinning. A persistent skin ailment that creates red, scaly
spots
on the scalp and might result in temporary hair loss.
Stress-Related Conditions
: A condition in which considerable stress causes a large number of hair follicles to enter the resting phase (telogen), causing hair loss. Hair loss is usually transitory and may be reversed after the underlying stress is treated. A psychological disease marked by a compulsive need to pluck out one's hair, resulting in visible hair loss.
Medications and Treatments
: Cancer treatments, which target rapidly dividing cells such as hair follicles, can cause hair loss. Side effects of medications such as warfarin and heparin include hair thinning and loss.  Hormonal contraceptives can cause
hair thinning
or loss, particularly in women who are genetically predisposed to hair loss.
Genetic Conditions
: This genetic disorder is also responsible for male or female pattern
baldness
, which is the most common cause of hair loss.
