<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Hormonal Imbalances</b><span>: Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can cause hair loss. Thyroid hormones regulate <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hair-regrow-serum%20">hair growth</a>, and abnormalities can disrupt the cycle. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal condition in women that causes hair thinning. Hormonal changes during menopause, particularly a drop in estrogen levels, can cause hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Autoimmune Diseases</b><span>: Autoimmune illness targets hair follicles, causing patchy hair loss on the scalp and other parts of the body. Lupus-related hair loss can be spotty or widespread. Another autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland and can result in hair thinning and loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Nutritional Deficiencies</b><span>: Low iron levels can cause hair thinning and loss. Iron is required to produce hemoglobin, which transports oxygen to the hair follicles. Vitamin D plays a vital role in the hair follicle cycle, and its deficiency can lead to hair loss. Biotin is needed for healthy hair growth.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Chronic Illnesses</b><span>: Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to poor blood circulation and limit oxygen supply to the scalp, resulting in hair loss. Chronic renal disease can cause nutrient and hormone imbalances that influence hair growth, resulting in hair loss. Liver diseases can affect the balance of hormones and nutrients, resulting in hair thinning and loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Scalp Infections and Conditions</b><span>: Fungal diseases, such as tinea capitis (scalp ringworm), can cause patchy hair loss. These infections are treated with antifungal medicines. The common scalp condition characterized by irritation,  flaking, and itching,, which can lead to hair thinning. A persistent skin ailment that creates red, scaly <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">spots</a> on the scalp and might result in temporary hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Stress-Related Conditions</b><span>: A condition in which considerable stress causes a large number of hair follicles to enter the resting phase (telogen), causing hair loss. Hair loss is usually transitory and may be reversed after the underlying stress is treated. A psychological disease marked by a compulsive need to pluck out one's hair, resulting in visible hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Medications and Treatments</b><span>: Cancer treatments, which target rapidly dividing cells such as hair follicles, can cause hair loss. Side effects of medications such as warfarin and heparin include hair thinning and loss.  Hormonal contraceptives can cause <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-thinning">hair thinning</a> or loss, particularly in women who are genetically predisposed to hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Genetic Conditions</b><span>: This genetic disorder is also responsible for male or female pattern <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/bald-patches">baldness</a>, which is the most common cause of hair loss.</span></p>
