<p><span>Babies, particularly new-born, are still adjusting to their harsh surroundings. As a result, their skin is extra sensitive and reacts quickly to even the slightest discomfort. For example, irritants such as soap, shampoo, and diapers can cause a rash or breakout. As a result, their skin requires special attention.</span></p>
<p><span>However, please keep in mind that every baby's skin is unique, and you should consult with your paediatrician if you have any concerns about your baby's skin. Here are seven essential steps for a gentle and effective baby skincare routine:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Use gentle, fragrance-free products</b><span>: Choose mild, fragrance-free products that are specifically designed for babies’ delicate skin. Look for products that are labelled "hypoallergenic" and "non-comedogenic."</span></p>

<li>
<p><b>Bath your baby in lukewarm water</b><span>: Fill a small baby bathtub or sink with lukewarm water (around 100 degrees Fahrenheit) and avoid hot water. Don't bathe your baby for too long or too frequently.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Be mindful of the soap</b><span>: Use a gentle </span>soap designed for babies<span> and sparingly. Don't use any products that can dry out the baby's skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Gently pat your baby's skin dry</b><span>: Avoid rubbing your baby's skin dry with a towel, which can be harsh on their delicate skin. Instead, use a soft towel and gently pat your baby's skin dry.</span></p>

<p><span>Diaper rash is a common skin irritation that affects many babies and young children. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including prolonged exposure to wet or dirty diapers, friction, and the use of certain chemicals or materials. One of the most important ways to prevent </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/top-5-diaper-rash-creams">diaper rash</a><span> is by ensuring that your child's diaper is changed regularly.</span></p>
<p><span>When a baby's diaper is wet or soiled, the moisture and bacteria in the diaper can irritate the skin and lead to a rash. To prevent this from happening, it is recommended that parents change their baby's diaper every two to three hours, or more often if the diaper is wet or soiled.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to changing the diaper regularly, it's important to make sure that the diaper area is clean and dry before putting on a new diaper. This can be done by gently wiping the area with a soft, damp cloth or using a baby wipe, and then patting the skin dry with a clean towel.</span></p>
<p><span>Other tips for preventing diaper rash include using a </span>diaper cream<span> or ointment to protect the skin, avoiding tight-fitting diapers or clothing, and giving your baby some time without a diaper to allow the skin to breathe. If your baby does develop a diaper rash, there are many over-the-counter creams and ointments that can help to soothe and heal the skin.</span></p>
<p><span>In summary, regular diaper changes are essential to preventing diaper rash. By keeping the diaper area clean and dry, using protective creams or ointments, and giving your baby some time without a diaper, you can help to keep your child's skin healthy and free from irritation.</span></p>

<p><span>Babies have delicate skin that is more sensitive to the sun's harmful rays than adult skin. Sunburn in childhood can increase the risk of skin cancer later in life, so it is important to protect babies from the sun. Here are some safe sun protection tips for babies:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Keep babies out of direct sunlight</b><span>: Infants should be kept out of direct sunlight, especially during peak hours between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. If possible, try to plan outdoor activities for early morning or late afternoon.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Dress babies in protective clothing</b><span>: Dress babies in lightweight, long-sleeved clothing and long pants to protect their skin from the sun. Choose clothes made from tightly woven fabric that provides good coverage. Hats with wide brims can protect their face, neck, and ears.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use sunscreen with caution</b><span>: Sunscreen can be used on babies six months or older, but it should be applied sparingly and with caution. Choose a </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/the-necessity-of-sunscreen-for-infants">sunscreen</a><span> with an SPF of at least 30 and look for one that is labelled "broad spectrum" to protect against both </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/uva-vs-uvb-rays-what-s-the-difference">UVA and UVB rays</a><span>. Apply sunscreen 15 minutes before going outside and reapply every two hours or after swimming or sweating.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Stay in the shade</b><span>: Seek out shaded areas such as under trees, umbrellas, or covered strollers. Shade can reduce UV exposure by up to 60%.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use sunglasses</b><span>: Protect your baby's eyes with sunglasses that have 100% UV protection. Look for glasses that wrap around their face and have an elastic strap to keep them in place.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Be aware of reflections</b><span>: Water, sand, and snow can reflect sunlight and increase UV exposure. Be mindful of this and take extra precautions when near these reflective surfaces.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Remember, the best way to protect your baby from the sun is to limit their exposure and cover up with protective clothing. If you are unsure about how to safely protect your baby from the sun, consult your paediatrician.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span>As the weather warms, make sure your baby is protected from the sun's damaging UV rays. Dress them in light, long-sleeved clothing with a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses. Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher to exposed skin and reapply as needed.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>To avoid skin feeling too oily in warm weather, switch from heavier winter moisturisers to lighter, non-greasy formulas. Look for gentle moisturisers that are safe for your baby's sensitive skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Springtime allergens like pollen can exacerbate skin conditions such as eczema. Keep an eye out for any signs of allergy-related skin reactions and consult with your pediatrician if needed.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<b>Summer</b><span>:</span>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Hot weather can lead to dehydration, which can affect your baby's skin. Ensure they stay well-hydrated by offering breast milk, formula, or water frequently, especially if you're spending time outdoors.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Try to avoid being outdoors during the peak hours of the sun (usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.). Seek shade whenever possible, and dress your baby in lightweight, breathable clothing that covers their skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Give your baby cool baths to help regulate their body temperature and soothe their skin. Avoid using hot water, as it can further dehydrate the skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<b>Fall:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>As the weather cools, the air becomes drier, which causes dry skin. Increase the frequency with which you moisturise your baby's skin to keep it hydrated and free of dryness and irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Dressing your baby for outdoor activities should take into account temperature fluctuations. Layering clothing helps them stay comfortable as the weather changes throughout the day.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Windy conditions can be harsh on your baby's sensitive skin. To protect against windburn, apply a barrier cream or petroleum jelly to any exposed areas, such as your face.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<b>Winter</b><span>:</span>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>To protect your baby from the cold, dress him or her in warm, layered clothing. Make sure they wear a hat and mittens to keep their extremities warm.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Indoor heating can dry out the air, causing dry skin. Use a humidifier in your baby's room to add moisture to the air and keep the skin from becoming dry and irritated.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Limit your bath time to 5-10 minutes and use lukewarm water to prevent your skin from drying out. Following a bath, gently pat your baby's skin dry and immediately apply moisturiser to lock in moisture.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><span>Comprehensive baby care encompasses all aspects of your child's well-being, from head to toe. Here's a breakdown of important care tips for each area.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Head</b><span>:</span> <span>Gently massage your baby's scalp with baby oil before bath time to help loosen flakes. Use a soft brush to gently remove scales, and shampoo with a mild baby shampoo. Use a mild baby shampoo to wash your baby's hair, and gently comb out any tangles with a soft brush or comb. Avoid using adult hair care products, as they may be too harsh for your baby's delicate scalp.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Face</b><span>:</span> <span>Use a soft washcloth or cotton pad dampened with warm water to gently clean your baby's face. Be especially careful around the eyes, nose, and mouth. Apply a gentle baby moisturizer to your baby's face after cleaning to help keep their skin soft and hydrated.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Eyes</b><span>:</span> <span>Use a clean, damp washcloth to wipe away any discharge from your baby's eyes. Be gentle and avoid rubbing the eyes, as this can cause irritation.If your baby's eyes appear red, swollen, or have excessive discharge , consult a pediatrician, as this may indicate an eye infection.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Ears</b><span>:</span> <span>Use a soft, damp washcloth to gently clean the outer part of your baby's ears. Avoid inserting anything into the ear canal, as this can damage the delicate structures inside. If you notice excessive earwax buildup, consult a pediatrician for guidance on safe removal methods.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Nose</b><span>:</span> <span>Use a bulb syringe or nasal aspirator to gently clear your baby's nasal passages if they have congestion or a stuffy nose.

<p><span>Gentle <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/baby-haircare">hair care</a> is essential for your baby's sensitive scalp and hair. Here are some strategies for maintaining a gentle and nurturing hair care routine:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Choose a gentle, tear-free baby shampoo designed specifically for infants. Look for hypoallergenic products that are free of harmful chemicals, fragrances, and dyes.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Babies typically do not require frequent hair washing. Aim to wash your baby's hair 2-3 times per week to avoid stripping away natural oils and drying out the scalp.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Before you shampoo your baby's hair, wet it with lukewarm water. Avoid using hot water because it can be too harsh on the scalp and hair follicles.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Apply a small amount of baby shampoo to your baby's scalp with your fingertips. Avoid harsh scrubbing, which can irritate the scalp.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>After shampooing, thoroughly rinse your baby's hair with warm water to get rid of any soap residue. Pour water over their head using a gentle cup or your hand, being careful not to make direct contact with their eyes.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>After bathing, gently pat your baby's hair with a soft towel to remove excess water. Avoid rubbing or wringing their hair, as this can cause breakage and tangles.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Use a wide-tooth comb or a soft brush designed for babies to gently detangle your baby's hair. Start from the ends and work your way up to the roots, being careful not to pull or tug on the hair.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Whenever possible, allow your baby's hair to air dry naturally after bathing. Avoid using heat styling tools such as hair dryers or curling irons, as they can damage your baby's delicate hair.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Consider using gentle hair accessories such as soft headbands, scrunchies, or clips to keep your baby's hair out of their face while protecting their sensitive scalp.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>As your baby's hair grows, trim any wispy ends or split ends to keep their hair healthy and prevent tangles.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Keep an eye out for symptoms of scalp irritation or conditions like cradle cap. If you notice redness, flakiness, or unusual patches on your baby's scalp, consult your paediatrician for advice.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>By incorporating these gentle hair care strategies into your baby's routine, you can help keep their scalp and hair healthy, clean, and comfortable while avoiding unnecessary irritation or discomfort.</span></p>
<h3><b>Importance of baby nail care for overall health</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Importance of baby nail care for overall health" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Importance_of_baby_nail_care_for_overall_health_480x480.jpg?v=1714827644"/></div>
<p><span>Baby nail care is an important aspect of overall health and well-being for the following reasons:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Babies' nails grow quickly and can be sharp, increasing the risk of accidental scratches to their delicate skin, especially on the face and body. Trimming their nails on a regular basis can help reduce the risk of skin injuries.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Babies may inadvertently scratch themselves, causing skin breaks that could become infected. Keeping their nails short and clean reduces the chance that harmful bacteria will enter these tiny wounds, lowering the risk of infection.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Long nails can cause discomfort in babies, especially if they accidentally scratch themselves or others. Trimming their nails helps them stay comfortable and irritation-free.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Babies frequently explore their surroundings with their hands, which raises the risk of nail-related injuries like snagging or tearing. Regular nail care helps to avoid such injuries and promotes safe exploration.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Keeping your baby's nails clean helps them develop good hygiene habits from a young age. Clean nails are less likely to contain dirt, bacteria, or other debris that can cause infections.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Babies may inadvertently scratch themselves while sleeping, which can disrupt their sleep patterns and cause discomfort. Short, well-groomed nails reduce the risk of sleep disturbances caused by scratching.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Long nails increase the risk of accidental eye injuries when babies rub their eyes with their hands. Trimming nails on a regular basis reduces this risk and protects their sensitive eyes.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Teaching your baby proper nail care at a young age promotes independence and self-care skills as they get older. It also instills good grooming habits that will help them throughout their lives.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Remedies for baby heat rash and skin soothing</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Remedies for baby heat rash and skin soothing" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Remedies_for_baby_heat_rash_and_skin_soothing_480x480.jpg?v=1714823401"/></div>
<p><span>Heat rash, also known as prickly heat or miliaria, develops when sweat ducts become clogged and sweat becomes trapped beneath the skin, causing redness, irritation, and tiny bumps. Here are some remedies and skin-soothing techniques to help relieve baby heat rash.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Keep the Skin Cool and Dry: </b><span>Dress your baby in lightweight, breathable clothing made from natural fibers like cotton. Avoid overdressing your baby, especially in hot and humid weather. Use air conditioning or fans to maintain a comfortable temperature indoors. Keep your baby's sleeping area cool and well-ventilated.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Frequent Baths: </b><span>Give your baby lukewarm baths to help cool the skin and remove sweat and irritants. Avoid using harsh soaps or scrubbing the affected area, as this can further irritate the skin. Pat your baby's skin dry gently with a soft towel after bathing. Avoid rubbing, as this can exacerbate irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Keep the Skin Moisturized: </b><span>Apply a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer to your baby's skin to help soothe irritation and keep it hydrated. Look for moisturizers containing ingredients like aloe vera or oatmeal, which have soothing properties.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid Irritating Products: </b><span>Avoid using products that may further irritate your baby's skin, such as scented lotions, perfumes, or harsh detergents. Choose mild, hypoallergenic skincare products specifically formulated for babies with sensitive skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Oatmeal Baths: </b><span>Adding colloidal oatmeal to your baby's bathwater can help soothe irritated skin and reduce inflammation. Use a muslin bag or clean sock to contain the oatmeal and prevent it from making a mess in the bath.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cool compresses</b><span>: Place cool, damp washcloths or gauze pads on the affected areas to reduce inflammation and relieve itching and discomfort. Ice packs and very cold compresses should be avoided because they are too harsh on your baby's sensitive skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Keep Your Baby Hydrated</b><span>: Give your baby plenty of breast milk or formula to help him stay hydrated, especially in hot weather. If your baby is older and eating solid foods, provide water in between meals to avoid dehydration.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consult a Paediatrician</b><span>: If your baby's heat rash persists or worsens despite home remedies, or if you notice signs of infection, such as pus or increased redness, see your paediatrician for further evaluation and treatment.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>By using these remedies and skin-soothing techniques, you can help your baby's heat rash and relieve discomfort and irritation.</span></p>

<p><b>Environmental Care</b><span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Make sure your baby's cot meets safety standards, including a firm mattress, a fitted sheet and no soft bedding or toys that could cause suffocation. To reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), follow the safe sleep guidelines.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Keep your baby's living spaces well-ventilated and free from indoor pollutants. Avoid smoking indoors and use an air purifier if needed to improve air quality.</span></p>

<p><span>Choose non-toxic, eco-friendly cleaning products and avoid using harsh chemicals or pesticides in your home. Opt for organic or natural materials whenever possible for bedding, clothing, and toys.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Create a sensory-rich environment for your baby by introducing toys, books, music, and colorful objects that stimulate their senses and encourage exploration.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Seasonal Care</b><span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Dress your baby in layers to regulate their body temperature according to the weather. Use lightweight, breathable fabrics in summer and add extra layers in winter to keep them warm and comfortable.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Protect your baby's delicate skin from the sun's harmful UV rays by dressing them in lightweight clothing that covers their arms, legs, and head. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher on exposed skin, and seek shade during peak sun hours.</span></p>

</li>
<li>
<p><span>Be aware of temperature changes indoors and outdoors, and dress your baby accordingly to keep them comfortable. Use fans, air conditioners, or heaters as needed to keep your home at a comfortable temperature.</span></p>

<h3><b>Protecting baby skin in cold weather</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Protecting baby skin in cold weather" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Protecting_baby_skin_in_cold_weather_480x480.jpg?v=1714827675"/></div>
<p><span>Protecting your baby's skin from cold weather is critical to avoiding dryness, irritation, and discomfort. Here are some ways to keep your baby's skin healthy and moisturised during the colder months:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Dress your baby in multiple thin layers rather than a single thick layer. This allows you to adjust their clothing as needed to keep their body temperature comfortable both indoors and out.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Choose soft, natural fabrics like cotton and wool to keep your baby warm without irritating their skin. Avoid synthetic materials that can trap moisture, resulting in overheating or chafing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Dress your baby in hats, mittens, and booties to protect his or her skin from cold temperatures and wind. Ensure that these accessories fit snugly but not too tightly to allow for proper circulation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Indoor heating can dry out the air, causing dry skin. Use a humidifier in your baby's room to moisten the air and keep their skin from becoming dry and irritated.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>While bathing is necessary to keep your baby clean, keep it to 5-10 minutes and use lukewarm water rather than hot. Avoid using harsh soaps or bubble baths, as these can deplete the skin's natural oils and cause dryness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Apply a gentle, fragrance-free moisturiser to your baby's skin after bathing and throughout the day to help seal in moisture and prevent dryness. Pay special attention to areas prone to dryness, such as your face, hands, and feet.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>While it is important to keep your baby warm in cold weather, avoid overheating, which can cause sweating and skin irritation. Dress your baby in breathable layers, and remove excess clothing if they become too warm.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Even in cold weather, the sun's UV rays can damage your baby's skin. When spending time outside, protect any exposed skin with a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Keep your baby hydrated by giving him breast milk, formula, or water on a regular basis, especially in heated indoor environments with dry air.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>If your baby's skin becomes excessively dry, irritated, or develops a rash despite your best efforts to protect it, see a paediatrician for further evaluation and treatment options.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>By following these guidelines, you can help protect your baby's skin from the harsh effects of cold weather and keep it healthy, hydrated, and comfortable throughout the winter season.</span></p>
<h3><b>Eco-friendly baby skincare solutions</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Eco-friendly baby skincare solutions" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Eco-friendly_baby_skincare_solutions_480x480.jpg?v=1714827899"/></div>
<p><span>Using eco-friendly baby skincare solutions benefits both your baby's delicate skin and the environment. Here are some environmentally friendly options to consider: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Look for baby skincare products that contain organic and natural ingredients. These products are free of harsh chemicals, synthetic fragrances, and artificial dyes, making them safer for your baby's skin and the environment.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>To reduce waste and environmental impact, choose baby skincare products that are packaged in biodegradable or recyclable materials. Look for brands that value sustainable packaging practices.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Choose skincare products with minimalist formulas that use fewer ingredients and avoid unnecessary additives. This reduces the environmental impact of production and disposal while lowering the risk of skin irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Consider creating your own baby skincare products with simple, natural ingredients from your kitchen, such as coconut oil, shea butter, olive oil, and beeswax. DIY skincare gives you control over the ingredients and reduces packaging waste.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Instead of disposable wipes, opt for reusable washcloths made of organic cotton or bamboo. Washcloths are gentle on your baby's skin and can be washed and reused, which reduces waste and saves money over time.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Support eco-friendly and sustainable baby skincare companies that prioritise ethical sourcing, environmentally friendly manufacturing processes, and clear labelling. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Limit the amount of water used when bathing your baby. Fill the bathtub only with the amount of water needed, and consider using a water-saving showerhead or bath bucket.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Choose multi-functional baby skincare products, such as a gentle cleanser that can also be used as shampoo or a moisturising balm that works as a nappy rash cream. This reduces the number of products you need to purchase and helps to reduce waste.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Empty baby skincare containers should be disposed of responsibly and recycled whenever possible. Consider upcycling containers for other uses, such as storage or organisation, to help them last longer and reduce landfill waste.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>By incorporating these eco-friendly baby skincare solutions into your daily routine, you can prioritise your baby's health while also reducing your environmental impact. Making conscious decisions about what products you use and how you dispose of them can benefit both your baby's future and the health of the planet.</span></p>

<p><span>Bathe your baby less frequently in cold and dry climates to avoid stripping their skin of natural oils. Use lukewarm water and a gentle, moisturising baby cleanser, and keep the bath time to 5-10 minutes.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Apply a rich, emollient moisturiser to your baby's skin after bathing and throughout the day to help retain moisture and prevent dryness. Pay special attention to areas prone to dryness, such as your face, hands, and feet.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Dress your baby in layers for warmth and insulation in cold weather. Use soft, breathable fabrics like cotton and wool, and layer up as needed to keep them comfortable indoors and out.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Protect your baby's skin from cold winds and low temperatures by covering them with hats, mittens, and booties. Make sure these accessories fit snugly, but not too tightly, to allow for proper circulation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Use a humidifier in your baby's room to moisten the air and keep their skin from becoming dry and irritated. Cleaning the humidifier on a regular basis will help to prevent mould and bacteria growth.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>By tailoring your baby's skincare routine to the weather, you can help keep their skin healthy, comfortable, and well-protected in any setting. Pay attention to your baby's cues and check their skin for signs of irritation or dryness; if you have any concerns, consult a paediatrician.</span></p>
