What is an Eczema Flare-up?
Eczema flare-up refers to a sudden and intense worsening of eczema symptoms, which include redness, itching, swelling, dryness, and skin irritation. It can be triggered by various factors, such as stress, environmental factors (like hot or cold weather), exposure to irritants or allergens, hormonal changes, or infections.
During a flare-up, the skin may become inflamed and itchy, causing discomfort and pain. Scratching the affected areas can further damage the skin and increase the risk of infection. Therefore, it's essential to manage eczema flare-ups promptly and effectively with proper medical treatment and self-care measures, such as keeping the skin moisturized, avoiding triggers, and using topical medications or oral medications as prescribed by a healthcare provider.
Understanding Eczema Flare-up Symptoms
Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic skin ailment that causes inflammation, dryness, itching, and, in severe cases, blistering or leaking of the skin. Eczema flare-ups vary in severity and duration, but they usually involve a worsening of symptoms. Some common signs of eczema flare-ups:
Itching (Pruritus)
: Itching is a common symptom of eczema and is often severe and persistent during flare-ups. The need to scratch might be overwhelming, causing more skin discomfort and serious consequences.
Redness (Erythema)
: During a flare-up, the affected skin may become red or inflamed, indicating that the body's immune system is responding to inflammation by increasing blood flow to the area.
Dryness
: Eczema flare-ups often cause the skin to become excessively dry and rough to the touch. The skin may appear scaly or flaky, and it may feel tight or uncomfortable.
Rash:
Eczema flare-ups can cause a rash with small, raised bumps or patches of inflamed skin. These rashes can range in size and distribution, depending on the individual and the severity of the flare-up.
Swelling (Edema)
: In some cases, the affected skin may become swollen or puffy during an eczema flare-up, particularly if there is significant inflammation present.
Cracking or Crusting
: Severe eczema flare-ups can cause the skin to crack or develop crusts, especially in areas where the skin is repeatedly scratched or rubbed.
Oozing or Weeping
: In severe situations, eczema flare-ups can cause the production of tiny blisters or vesicles that ooze fluid before crusting over. This can increase the likelihood of infection and additional skin injury.
Pain or Discomfort
: Eczema flare-ups can cause pain and discomfort, especially if the skin becomes cracked, blistering, or infected. The itching sensation may also cause discomfort and distress.
Sleep Disturbances
: Itching and discomfort associated with eczema flare-ups can disrupt sleep patterns, leading to fatigue and irritability.
Psychological Impact
: Eczema flare-ups can have a significant psychological impact on individuals, causing stress, anxiety, and depression due to the chronic nature of the condition and its impact on daily life.
It's important to note that eczema symptoms can vary greatly from person to person and alter over time. Eczema flare-ups can also be caused by a variety of causes, including environmental irritants, allergies, stress, hormone changes, and specific diets. Managing eczema frequently entails identifying and avoiding triggers, applying emollients and moisturisers to keep the skin hydrated, and according to a healthcare professional's recommended treatment plan, which may include topical corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or other drugs. If you or someone you know is having eczema symptoms, you should get medical attention for correct diagnosis and treatment.
Triggers of Eczema Flare-ups
Eczema flare-ups can be triggered by a variety of factors, which can vary from person to person. Identifying and avoiding these triggers is an essential part of managing eczema and reducing the frequency and severity of flare-ups. Here are some common triggers of eczema flare-ups:
Allergens are substances that can trigger an allergic reaction in susceptible individuals. Common allergens that may exacerbate eczema include pollen, pet dander, dust mites, mold, and certain foods (such as eggs, dairy, nuts, and shellfish).
Irritants are substances that can irritate the skin and exacerbate eczema symptoms. Common irritants include harsh soaps, detergents, fragrances, household cleaners, and personal care products containing alcohol or other drying ingredients.
Dry air can strip moisture from the skin, leading to dryness and increased sensitivity. Cold, dry weather in the winter months can exacerbate eczema symptoms, as can indoor heating systems that reduce humidity levels.
Hot weather and excessive sweating can exacerbate eczema symptoms by increasing skin irritation and moisture loss. Tight-fitting clothing, synthetic fabrics, and heavy blankets can trap heat and sweat against the skin, further aggravating eczema flare-ups.
Stress is known to trigger or worsen eczema symptoms in many individuals. Emotional stress, anxiety, and depression can weaken the immune system and disrupt the skin's barrier function, making it more susceptible to inflammation and flare-ups.
Hormonal changes can influence eczema symptoms, particularly in women. Fluctuations in hormone levels during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause can trigger or exacerbate eczema flare-ups in some individuals.
Physical irritation of the skin, such as friction from scratching, rubbing, or wearing rough clothing, can exacerbate eczema symptoms and lead to flare-ups. It's essential to avoid scratching or rubbing affected areas to prevent further irritation and damage to the skin.
Certain foods may cause eczema flare-ups in some people, especially those with food allergies or sensitivities. Dairy products, eggs, nuts, wheat, soy, and shellfish are among the most common trigger foods. Keeping a food journal might help you discover potential triggers and make nutritional changes.
Environmental factors such as pollution, smoke, and exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or artificial sources (e.g., tanning beds) can exacerbate eczema symptoms and trigger flare-ups in some individuals.
Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections can exacerbate eczema symptoms and trigger flare-ups, particularly if the skin's barrier function is compromised. Eczema-related infections are most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria and herpes simplex viruses.
Contact dermatitis occurs when the skin comes into contact with a substance that causes irritation or an allergic reaction. Common irritants and allergens that can trigger contact dermatitis and exacerbate eczema include nickel, latex, certain plants (e.g., poison ivy), and topical medications.
Certain medications, including antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and beta-blockers, might cause or worsen eczema symptoms in certain people. If you feel that a drug is causing your eczema flare-ups, visit your doctor for advice.
Eczema Flare-ups: Causes
Eczema is a chronic skin condition that causes dry, itchy, and inflamed skin. While the exact cause of eczema is unknown, it is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Eczema flare-ups occur when the skin becomes more irritated and inflamed, leading to symptoms such as itching, redness, and rash. Here are some common causes of eczema flare-ups:
Environmental Triggers:
Exposure to irritants like soaps, detergents, perfumes, and cleaning products can trigger eczema flare-ups. Allergens like pollen, dust mites, and pet dander can also trigger eczema.
Stress:
Emotional stress can weaken the immune system and trigger eczema flare-ups. Stress can also lead to scratching and itching, which can worsen eczema symptoms.
Weather:
Changes in temperature and
humidity
can cause the skin to become dry and itchy, triggering eczema flare-ups. Cold, dry weather in particular can be a trigger for some people.
Food Allergies:
Certain foods can trigger eczema in some people. Common food triggers include dairy products, nuts, and eggs.
Hormonal Changes:
Hormonal changes during puberty,
pregnancy
, and menopause can trigger eczema flare-ups.
Skin Infections:
Skin infections like impetigo,
herpes simplex
, and fungal infections can cause eczema flare-ups.
It's important to identify your personal triggers and avoid them as much as possible to reduce the frequency and severity of eczema flare-ups.
Environmental Factors Contributing to Eczema Flare-ups
Environmental factors influence skin moisture, irritation, and immunological responses, all of which contribute significantly to eczema flare-ups. Here are some environmental elements that can cause eczema flare-ups:
Low humidity levels in the air can cause dry skin, which is a major trigger for eczema flare-ups. Dry air, especially in winter or arid locations, can cause the skin to lose moisture more quickly, resulting in increased dryness and irritation.
Extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, can worsen eczema. Cold weather can dry up the skin, whilst warmer weather can cause excessive sweating and discomfort. Rapid temperature variations, such as switching between heated indoor and chilly outdoor situations, can also cause flare-ups.
Indoor heating systems, particularly those that use forced air or central heating, can reduce humidity levels in the air, leading to dry skin and exacerbating eczema symptoms. Similarly, air conditioning can dry out the air and contribute to skin dehydration.
Pollen, dust mites, cat dander, mould, and grass can all cause allergic reactions in people with eczema, resulting in flare-ups. These allergies can be found both indoors and outdoors, and their prevalence varies by season and geographic area.
Airborne irritants such as smoke, pollution, and chemical fumes can irritate the skin and trigger eczema flare-ups. Exposure to cigarette smoke, vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, and indoor air pollutants can exacerbate symptoms in susceptible individuals.
Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun can aggravate eczema symptoms in some individuals. While moderate sun exposure may have anti-inflammatory effects on the skin, excessive exposure to UV radiation can lead to sunburn, skin dryness, and irritation, worsening eczema symptoms.
Hard water, chlorinated water, and other water contaminants can strip the skin of its natural oils and disrupt the skin barrier, leading to dryness and irritation. Frequent bathing or swimming in water with poor water quality can exacerbate eczema symptoms in sensitive individuals.
Rough or scratchy textiles, synthetic materials, and tight-fitting clothing can irritate the skin, resulting in eczema flare-ups. To reduce friction and irritation, consider soft, breathable fabrics and loose-fitting garments.
Certain occupations or work settings may expose people to environmental variables that aggravate eczema symptoms. For example, healthcare professionals, food handlers, cleaners, and hairdressers may come into contact with irritants, allergens, or harsh chemicals that irritate the skin and cause flare-ups.
Traveling to different climates or environments can expose individuals to new environmental triggers that may exacerbate eczema symptoms. Changes in humidity, temperature, water quality, and air quality can all affect the skin and contribute to flare-ups.
Genetic Predispositions and Eczema Flare-ups
Genetic predispositions influence the onset and severity of eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis. While genetics do not fully determine eczema, people with a family history of the condition, allergies, or asthma are more likely to get it. Here's how hereditary variables might cause eczema flare-ups:
Genetic Mutations
: Certain genetic abnormalities or changes can make an individual more susceptible to eczema. Mutations in genes that control skin barrier function, immunological response, and inflammation can damage the skin's protective barrier, making it more susceptible to irritation and inflammation, resulting in eczema flare-ups.
Filaggrin Gene Mutation
: The filaggrin gene is essential for maintaining the skin barrier's integrity. Mutations in the filaggrin gene are linked to poor skin barrier function, which can result in increased water loss, dryness, and sensitivity to irritants and allergens. Individuals with filaggrin gene mutations are more likely to develop eczema and have more severe flare-ups.
Immune Dysregulation
: Genetic factors can influence how the immune system responds to environmental triggers, allergens, and infections, resulting in immunological dysregulation and skin inflammation. Dysfunctional immune responses can worsen eczema symptoms and lead to recurring flare-ups.
Atopic Triad
: Eczema is one of three linked allergy disorders known as the atopic triad, together with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and asthma. Individuals with a family history of eczema are more likely to acquire additional atopic illnesses, indicating a common genetic predisposition to allergic diseases.
Polygenic Inheritance
: Eczema is classified as a complex genetic illness caused by numerous genes rather than a single gene mutation. Polygenic inheritance indicates that numerous genetic variables contribute to an individual's vulnerability to eczema, and the interaction of these genes with environmental factors influences the likelihood of acquiring the condition and having flare-ups.
While genetic predispositions play an important role in eczema, environmental factors can also initiate and worsen flare-ups. Environmental factors such as allergens, irritants, environment, stress, and lifestyle can combine with genetic vulnerabilities to cause eczema symptoms. Understanding both genetic and environmental variables is critical for controlling eczema and lowering the frequency and severity of flare-ups. If you have a family history of eczema or other allergy problems, you must be proactive in managing your skin's health and avoiding potential triggers. Working closely with a healthcare practitioner, such as a dermatologist or allergist, can aid in the development of a tailored treatment plan to control eczema symptoms and improve overall skin health.
Eczema Flare-ups: Treatment
Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic skin condition characterized by itchy, red, and inflamed skin. While there is no cure for eczema, there are several treatments that can help manage symptoms and reduce flare-ups. Here are some treatment options for eczema flare-ups:

Medical Treatments for Eczema Flare-ups
Medical therapies for eczema flare-ups are intended to reduce inflammation, alleviate itching, restore skin barrier function, and prevent secondary infections. Treatment options are determined by the degree of symptoms, individual preferences, and medical history. Below are some popular medical treatments for eczema flare-ups:
Topical Corticosteroids
: Topical corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs that are applied directly to the skin to alleviate inflammation and itching. They come in a variety of strengths and formulations, ranging from moderate to strong, and are primarily used for short-term treatment of eczema flare-ups. To reduce the risk of adverse effects such as skin thinning or steroid rebound, follow your healthcare provider's instructions for frequency and duration of treatment.
Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors
: Topical calcineurin inhibitors, including tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel), are nonsteroidal medicines that reduce inflammation and immunological reactions in the skin. They are used to treat mild to moderate eczema and are especially beneficial in sensitive areas like the face and groyne, where corticosteroids may be less effective.
Topical Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) Inhibitors
: Crisaborole (Eucrisa) is a topical medicine that inhibits the enzyme phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4), which is involved in inflammation. It is used to treat mild to moderate eczema and helps alleviate itching and inflammation.
Topical Calcineurin Inhibitor with Corticosteroid Combination Therapy
: Some treatments combine a topical calcineurin inhibitor and a low-potency corticosteroid to give anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. This combo therapy may be beneficial in lowering inflammation and alleviating symptoms in those with moderate to severe eczema.
Systemic Corticosteroids
: Severe eczema flare-ups that do not respond to topical therapies may require the use of oral or injectable corticosteroids. Systemic corticosteroids, on the other hand, are normally used for short-term treatment since they carry the risk of major side effects such as adrenal suppression, osteoporosis, and increased susceptibility to infections.
Antihistamines
: Oral antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or cetirizine (Zyrtec), may be recommended to relieve itching and help improve sleep during eczema flare-ups. While antihistamines do not directly treat eczema, they can provide symptomatic relief from itching and discomfort.
