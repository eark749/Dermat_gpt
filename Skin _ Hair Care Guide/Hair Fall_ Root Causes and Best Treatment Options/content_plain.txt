Hair fall, or hair loss, can be caused by several factors, including genetics and lifestyle decisions. Understanding the underlying reasons is important in determining the most effective treatment options. In this blog, we'll look at some frequent causes and recommended therapies.
The Basics of Hair Growth and Hair Fall
What can you do to help thinning hair grow back if you find additional hair in your shower drain or more strands than normal on your hairbrush? Hair regrowth may be possible in some cases of
hair loss
, including female pattern hair loss (FPHL). To restore thinning hair, be gentle with it, reduce stress, and increase your iron and protein consumption.
Hair Growth Cycle: Anagen, Catagen, and Telogen Phases
Hair grows everywhere on our skin except on the palms and soles of our feet, our eyelids, and belly buttons, yet many hairs are so fine that they are nearly invisible.  Hair is composed of keratin, a protein produced in hair follicles in the outer layer of the skin. As follicles develop new hair cells, old cells are pushed out through the skin's surface at a rate of approximately 6 inches every year. The visible hair is made up of dead keratin cells.
The normal adult's head contains 100,000 to 150,000 hairs and loses up to 100 of them each day; spotting a few stray hairs on your brushes is not a necessary reason for concern. At any given time, around 90% of the hair on a person's scalp is growing. Each follicle has a unique life cycle that can be impacted by age, disease, and a range of other variables. The life cycle is separated into three stages:
Anagen active
hair growth
that typically lasts between 2 and 8 years.
Catagen transitional hair growth that lasts two to three weeks.
Telogen is a resting phase that lasts approximately 2 to 3 months; at the end of the resting phase, the hair is shed and replaced by new hair, and the growing cycle begins again.
Normal Hair Shedding vs. Hair Loss
It is essential to understand the distinction between them to determine when there is a more serious hair loss issue. Shedding is a normal part of the hair growth cycle. On average, people shed 50-100 hairs per day. During the hair growth cycle, hairs enter a resting phase known as the telogen stage. At the end of this 3-4-month period, part of your hair will fall out. Hairs on a typical scalp are in various phases of the hair development cycle at any one time. As a result, when you lose some hair, the rest grows or becomes dormant. In a healthy person's scalp, around 85% of the hair follicles are actively growing, with the remaining 15% considered resting.
Hair shedding is normal, but excessive shedding can be problematic. A stressful incident or shock to your system might trigger telogen effluvium, which is a transient hair loss condition characterized by excessive shedding of resting (telogen) hair. Alopecia, or long-term hair loss, is more serious. Hormonal imbalances, medical disorders, genetics, and drugs are all potential causes. There are several types of hair loss, including
androgenetic alopecia
(male and female pattern
baldness
), scarring alopecia (permanent hair loss caused by scarring of hair follicles), traction alopecia (consistently pulling at hair roots), and
alopecia areata
(an autoimmune disorder).
A correct diagnosis is essential for determining treatment. For example, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of scarring alopecia can prevent hair follicle scarring, allowing for hair regrowth. Understanding the difference between hair shedding and hair loss is critical for implementing effective strategies. While shedding is a normal part of the hair growth cycle, chronic or excessive loss can signal an underlying problem that requires care. If you suspect considerable hair loss, see a
dermatologist
for a complete exam.
Signs of Excessive Hair Fall
The signs and symptoms of hair loss can include:
This is the most prevalent form of hair loss, which occurs as people age. Men's hairline on the forehead frequently recedes. Women's hair often has a broader portion. Receding hairlines (facial fibrosing alopecia) is an increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women.
Some people lose hair in circular or spotty bald areas on their heads, beard, or brows. Before hair loss, your skin may feel irritated or unpleasant.
Hair might loosen in response to a physical or mental trauma. Handfuls of hair may fall out when combing or washing your hair, or even with a gentle tug. This form of hair loss typically results in overall hair thinning, however, it is transitory.
Some illnesses and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can cause hair loss all over the body. Hair normally grows back.
This is indicative of ringworm. It may be accompanied by broken hair, redness, swelling, and, on occasion, leaking.
Root Causes of Hair Fall
Several factors contribute to hair loss. The cause of your hair loss can determine whether your hair:
The fallout can be sudden or gradual.
Thins
It may regrow on its own.
Requires surgery for regeneration.
Immediate care is required to avoid permanent hair loss.
1. Genetic Factors: Androgenetic Alopecia
Androgenetic alopecia, often known as male-pattern baldness or female-pattern baldness, is a genetic disorder that causes hair loss in a distinct pattern. This form of hair loss is governed by genetics and hormones, specifically androgens, which regulate hair development.
2. Hormonal Imbalances: Thyroid Issues, PCOS, and Menopause
Thyroid Issues
:
Symptoms include hair loss,
dry skin
, weariness, weight gain, and cold sensitivity. Low thyroid hormone levels can delay hair development, making it thin and brittle. This might harm the scalp and brows. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy (such as levothyroxine) can help restore normal hormone levels and promote hair growth over time.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
: Irregular menstrual periods, hirsutism (excess body hair),
acne
, weight gain, and hair thinning (androgenic alopecia). Elevated amounts of androgens (male hormones) can cause scalp hair thinning and excessive facial and body hair growth.
Menopause
: Hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, weight gain, and hair thinning. During menopause, low levels of estrogen and progesterone can cause a relative rise in androgens, causing hair follicles to shrink and resulting in hair thinning and loss.
3. Nutritional Deficiencies: Iron, Vitamin D, and Protein
Iron
: Hemoglobin is made up of iron, a mineral. Hemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells that is important for carrying oxygen throughout the body. For healthy hair growth, the hair follicles require oxygen delivered through the scalp's microscopic blood capillaries. Numerous studies have found a link between iron deficiency (a lack of iron in the blood) and hair loss, especially in telogen effluvium (acute or chronic) and androgenetic alopecia.
Vitamin D
: The sun helps the body generate vitamin D. A lack of vitamin D can exacerbate reactional hair loss (acute telogen effluvium), particularly in the autumn.
Protein
: Adequate protein intake is therefore essential in providing the amino acids required for proper hair development. Protein shortages can induce hair loss, exacerbate all types of hair loss, and have a negative impact on all hair loss treatments.
4. Stress and Its Impact on Hair Health
If you lose more than the average 80-100 strands of hair every day, you may be experiencing stress-related hair loss. If you observe bald patches on your scalp, this could be an indication of Alopecia Areata. If you've felt the impulse to pull out your hair, it could be stress-related trichotillomania.
5. Medical Conditions: Alopecia Areata, Scalp Infections, and Autoimmune Diseases
Alopecia Areata
: Alopecia areata is a disease that happens when the immune system attacks hair follicles and causes hair loss. Hair follicles are the structures in the skin that form hair. While hair can be lost from any part of the body, alopecia areata usually affects the head and face.
Scalp Infections
: Fungus or bacteria can enter the scalp through damaged skin or hair follicles, causing infection. Ringworm, folliculitis, and impetigo are among the possible causes. Bacteria cause some common infections, including folliculitis and impetigo. Others, like ringworms, are fungal.
Autoimmune Diseases
: Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease. It happens when a person's immune system attacks their hair follicles, leading to hair loss. There also appears to be an association between alopecia areata and other autoimmune diseases, such as vitiligo, lupus, and
atopic dermatitis
(a kind of
eczema
).
6. Medications and Treatments: Chemotherapy, Antidepressants, and Birth Control Pills
Chemotherapy employs potent drugs that target rapidly growing cancer cells. The medications also harm other rapidly growing cells in your body. These include cells in the hair roots. Chemotherapy may result in hair loss across your body, not only on your scalp.
Some antidepressants may induce hair loss as a side effect. The specific process is unknown, however, it is thought that these drugs can alter the hair growth cycle, resulting in excessive shedding (telogen effluvium).
Hormones found in birth control tablets can alter hair growth and shedding. Hormonal imbalances caused by the use or withdrawal of birth control tablets might result in hair loss. Some women may develop hair thinning as a result of androgens found in certain birth control tablets. Women who are genetically predisposed to androgenetic alopecia may be more vulnerable to these hormonal alterations.
7. Environmental Factors: Pollution and UV Radiation
UV
radiation, a well-known external cause of
aging
, has been linked to a variety of health problems due to its high energy level. In polluted surroundings, a large amount of particulate matter adheres to the hair surface and harms the scalp, resulting in hair loss.
8. Effective Dietary Changes for Hair Health
Vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid are also essential for your hair. Vegetarians and vegans frequently consume insufficient quantities. B6-rich foods include bananas, potatoes (both white and sweet), and spinach. Meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products are major sources of vitamin B12.
9. Importance of a Balanced Diet
A good diet can help keep your hair thick and lustrous. What you consume can also help prevent hair loss. If you are not getting specific nutrients from your diet, you may notice the impact in your hair. Essential fatty acids, particularly omega-3s, are essential for maintaining healthy skin, hair, and nails.
10. Foods Rich in Protein for Stronger Hair
Eggs are high in protein and biotin, both of which are vital ingredients for healthy hair development. Eating adequate protein promotes hair development since hair follicles are primarily composed of protein.
11. Essential Vitamins and Minerals: Biotin, Zinc, and Omega-3 Fatty Acids
Biotin (Vitamin B7)
: Biotin is required for the production of keratin, a protein that forms the framework of hair, skin, and nails. Sources include eggs, nuts, seeds, salmon, sweet potatoes, and spinach. It promotes hair development, increases hair strength, and decreases hair thinning.
Zinc
: Zinc plays an important role in DNA and RNA creation, which is required for optimal follicle health and hair development. It also aids in the normal operation of the oil glands surrounding the hair follicles. Sources include meat, seafood, legumes, seeds, nuts, dairy products, eggs, and whole grains. It prevents hair loss, stimulates cell reproduction and tissue growth, and keeps oil-secreting glands linked to hair follicles.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
: Omega-3 fatty acids supply important proteins and nutrients to hair follicles and skin, promoting healthy hair development and lowering inflammation that can cause hair loss. Sources include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, and sardines), flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, and plant oils. Promotes hair growth, adds gloss and luster, decreases scalp irritation, and protects against
dry scalp
and flaky scalps.
12. Hydration and Its Role in Hair Health
Insufficient water might disrupt the natural hair growth cycle. Hair follicles may undergo a resting period, reducing the pace of hair growth. This might lead to sluggish or slow hair growth over time. Well-hydrated hair reflects light, resulting in a natural shine and gloss.
Medical Treatments for Hair Fall
Dermatologists who specialize in hair loss and scalp problems have treated thousands of patients with various forms of hair loss. They frequently recommend medicine to assist prevent future hair loss and, when possible, to regenerate hair.
1. Topical Treatments: Minoxidil
Topical minoxidil prevents hair thinning and promotes new hair growth. Alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks healthy tissues, including the hair follicles, telogen effluvium, a condition in which hair falls out all over the scalp due to an interruption in the body's cycle of hair production, anagen effluvium, or rapid hair loss resulting from medical treatment, hypotrichosis, a rare condition in which very little hair grows on the scalp and body, and some forms of cicatricial, or scarring, alopecia can benefit from this medication.
2. Oral Medications: Finasteride and Spironolactone
Oral finasteride is a prescription medication that treats male pattern hair loss, also known as androgenetic alopecia. Finasteride reduces hair loss and promotes new hair growth by suppressing the body's synthesis of a hormone that destroys hair follicles. This drug is given orally once per day and works best when taken at the same time every day. Finasteride begins to act after four months, but you may not see considerable hair growth for up to a year. Your dermatologist will assess this development after six months to determine whether to continue therapy. If the medicine is effective, treatment can be continued for as long as new hair growth is required. If you stop using the medicine, you may have hair loss again.
Spironolactone is an aldosterone receptor agonist or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). This means that spironolactone reduces the production of androgens, or testosterone hormones, which are primarily responsible for hair loss.
3. Hormone Therapy for Hair Loss
Hormone replacement treatment (HRT) can delay or even prevent hair loss in certain women. It's difficult to forecast who will profit. Body-identical estrogen and progesterone are preferred.
4. Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy
Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections can help cure male pattern baldness by reducing hair loss and encouraging new hair growth. PRP can also help stimulate hair growth following a transplant.
Hair Transplant Surgery: FUE and FUT Methods
If you're thinking about getting a hair transplant to restore your lost hair, you're not alone. According to recent studies, around 85% of men and 40% of women are affected by hair loss, and hair restoration provides the opportunity for a fuller head of hair. Follicular unit excision (FUE) and follicular unit transplantation (FUT) are two prominent hair transplant procedures. Both types of transplants can restore your hair, giving you naturally thicker, fuller locks, but there are some significant differences.
FUE hair transplant
: The FUE hair transplant process is the more advanced of the two. Individual follicles from the back of your scalp are used for hair grafting. This is done with tiny punches before the grafted hair follicles are carefully put in small holes formed at the recipient site (where your new hair will develop). After the procedure is completed, your scalp will be bandaged for several days. After falling out, your transplanted hair will begin to grow back within three to four months.
FUT hair transplant
: The FUT (Follicular Unit Transplantation, or linear strip excision) procedure extracts hair grafts by cutting a strip of skin from the rear of the scalp. This strip is usually a few inches long. After the donor site (from which the strip was obtained) has been sewn up, the strip can be divided into smaller portions using a surgical tool. These smaller parts are then implanted into the recipient site, where the process of hair restoration begins. After transplantation, the follicles will fall out and be replaced with permanent follicles for three to four months.
Natural Remedies and Home Treatments
Reduce stress
:
Your emotional and physical well-being may have an impact on your hair. Telogen effluvium is a kind of hair loss that is commonly caused by emotional or physical stress. You may simply remove handfuls of your hair by combing, running your hands through it, or shampooing.
Make Dietary Changes
: A lack of certain nutrients in your diet can lead to hair loss. Hair loss is one of the most prevalent symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. You may develop iron deficiency anemia if you do not consume enough iron in your diet.
Consider Supplements
: A natural supplement designed to promote hair growth can be beneficial. Biotin and folic acid supplements, for example, are frequently used to treat hair loss.
Use a Topical Treatment
: You may want to talk to your doctor about starting Rogaine (minoxidil), a topical treatment for hair loss.
Essential Oils
: According to research, essential oils are a natural and economical alternative treatment for hair growth.  Massaging pumpkin seed, rosemary, or tea tree oil into your scalp before bedtime may promote hair development.
Be Gentle with Your Hair
: Using harsh chemicals or pulling on already fragile hair can easily damage it. If your hair is falling out or thinning, you should be gentle with it.
Limit Bleaching or Coloring Your Hair
: Coloring your hair too frequently damages it and may exacerbate hair loss. Avoid lightening your hair because bleaching typically uses a lot of peroxide, which can harm your hair. Instead, choose a dye that is close to your natural
hair color
.
Avoid Excessive Heat Styling
: Heat, like bleach and dye, damages already fragile hair and may contribute to hair loss. Avoid blow-drying your hair. Instead, let your hair dry naturally or wrap it in a microfiber towel to absorb water.
Treat Dandruff
:
Dandruff
usually affects the scalp, causing little chunks of dry skin to flake off. Dandruff can not directly cause hair loss, but it can create scalp itching, which exacerbates the condition.
Aloe Vera for Scalp Health:
You can apply raw aloe vera gel directly to your hair and scalp. Apply it with your hands to your scalp, hair, and ends. To help lock in moisture, rub in a few drops of castor oil. Allow the aloe vera to soak for around 30 minutes before rinsing.
Onion Juice for Hair Growth:
When 1 onion's juice is combined with 2 aloe vera stems and 100-250 ml of coconut oil, it creates a perfect elixir to prevent hair loss while also reducing the intense scent of the onion juice, which may irritate the eyes. This can be left on overnight, or at least for 3–4 hours, before repeated shampooing to cleanse the scalp.
Green Tea Rinse:
Steep the green tea bags in water for at least an hour to allow the tea to brew and cool. To make a cold brew tea rinse, use the same quantity of water and soak the green tea bags overnight. Transfer the tea to a clean spray bottle.
Shampoo
and condition your hair as normal.
Essential Oils: Rosemary, Peppermint, and Lavender:
Rosemary essential oil, a natural cure for hair loss, has been shown to stimulate healthy hair growth over time by boosting microcirculation on the scalp. It is blended with lavender essential oil, which is known for its anti-inflammatory characteristics and helps to balance scalp sebum and soothe the scalp.
Peppermint oil can help slow down or prevent hair loss, as well as restore hair that has already been lost. If you're dealing with female or male pattern baldness, or any other sort of hair loss, try including peppermint oil into your hair care routine – Energizing Shampoo is an excellent choice.
Developing a Hair Care Routine
Wash
: The first step in caring for your hair is to cleanse it. Choose a shampoo that is specifically formulated for your hair type and texture to help you reach your hair goals, such as moisturizing or adding body and volume. Hot water can dry your hair and cause color to fade, so wash and condition with warm water. Shampoo should be used on the scalp and top of your hair to remove excess oil and product buildup.
Condition:
Like shampoo, choose a
conditioner
that is designed for your hair type and addresses your specific hair difficulties. Those with fine or thin hair should choose a lighter conditioner that will not weigh it down, whereas those with thicker hair may prefer something heavier and more nourishing.  Concentrate on applying conditioner to the mid-shaft downwards, where the hair is dryer and needs more
hydration
.
Treat
: After getting out of the shower, dry your hair with a microfiber cloth. Microfiber is gentler on hair than terry cloth, and it absorbs more moisture. Hair is especially fragile when it is moist. So, after towel drying, gently detangle with a wet brush or wide-tooth comb before applying any products. Post-shower products, like shampoos and conditioners, are formulated to meet the needs of various hair types. Consider using
hair oils
and serums, leave-in conditioners, heat protectants, and air-dry creams. Which products you use will be determined by your hair type and texture, as well as the results you want to attain.
Dry
: The next stage in your haircare procedure is drying. You have two choices: air dry or heat dry. Allowing your hair to air dry sometimes is advantageous since it provides a reprieve from the heat and reduces the chance of heat damage. If you're going to heat dry your hair, use a dryer that's designed to dry it faster and with less intense heat.
Style
: The final stage in your hair care regimen is styling. If you're satisfied with the way your hair looks after air drying, you can skip this step. You may wish to straighten or curl your hair before going to work or out. When using hot tools, keep the heat on a low setting to avoid damage. Styling products can help you finish your appearance while also managing any
frizz
or flyaways.
Choosing the Right Shampoo and Conditioner
Determine your hair type
: To select the appropriate shampoo and conditioner, you must first determine your hair type. The four main kinds of hair are straight, wavy, curly, and coiled.
Think about your scalp
: In addition to your hair type, you should consider your scalp. Do you have dry or
oily scalp
? Do you have dandruff or an itchy scalp? These factors can also influence the type of shampoo and conditioner you use.
Look for key ingredients
: When selecting a shampoo and conditioner, pay attention to the components. Some crucial elements to check for include sulfate-free, protein, moisturizing compounds, and pH balance.
Consider Your Hair Goals
: What are your hairstyle goals? Do you want to add volume to your hair? Would you like to reduce frizz? Do you want to improve your curls? Consider your hair goals while selecting a shampoo and conditioner. Here's how to set and realize your hair goals: Target your main worries, keep regular track of your outcomes, and be consistent in your efforts while giving it adequate time.
Experiment
: Experiment with different shampoos and conditioners to see which ones work best for you. Everyone's hair is different, so what works for one may not work for another. Don't hesitate to try different products until you find the one that works best for your hair.
Regular Scalp Massages
Massaging your scalp every day improves blood circulation and might even strengthen your follicles. However, be careful to brush lightly, not violently. This may cause your hair to break. If you used oil while massaging your scalp, be sure to rinse it off within an hour.
Avoiding Heat and Chemical Damage
If possible, give your hair a break from heat styling for a few weeks or even longer. This will allow healthy new hair to grow. If you can't fully avoid using hairdryers, straighteners, or curling tongs on your hair, attempt to limit the amount of time you do.
Proper Hair Washing and Drying Techniques
When you shampoo your hair, softly massage your scalp in small circles. You can use your fingertips to remove debris, skin flakes, oils, and residue. (Consider using a scalp scrub once or twice per week.) A shampoo brush is an excellent addition to your shower regimen for stimulating your scalp and revitalizing your hair.
Advanced Hair Fall Solutions
The most popular options include minoxidil (Rogaine). Minoxidil is available over the counter (without a prescription) in liquid, foam, and shampoo form. For maximum effectiveness, apply the product to the scalp skin once daily for women and twice daily for males.
Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT)
Low-level laser therapy, commonly known as red light therapy or cold laser therapy, irradiates photons into scalp tissues. These photons are absorbed by weak cells, promoting hair growth.
Microneedling for Hair Regeneration
A microneedling session aims to promote hair growth by increasing blood flow to the scalp. Microneedling is an excellent treatment for hair loss and thinning hair. In some situations, it can even stimulate hair growth. The microneedles create tiny incisions on the scalp, stimulating blood flow.
Mesotherapy for Hair Loss
Mesotherapy is an excellent therapeutic option for those suffering from hair loss. This treatment minimizes hair thinning, which is one of the leading reasons for a serious hair loss illness. This procedure is painless and non-surgical. It involves injecting stem cell serum or platelet-rich plasma into the scalp.
Lifestyle Changes to Prevent Hair Fall
A final cause of hair loss due to lifestyle is a lack of sleep. Your body requires adequate sleep to produce adult stem cells, and stress from a lack of sleep can trigger hair loss. If your hair loss is caused by a lack of sleep, reducing stress and obtaining more sleep will help to reverse it.
Managing Stress Effectively
Five strategies for managing stress and reducing the overall tension of daily activities:
Guided meditation is an excellent way to divert oneself from the stresses of everyday life. There are numerous guided meditations available online that can help you achieve five minutes of focused calm.
Deep breathing is an excellent strategy to lessen the activation of your sympathetic nervous system, which governs the body's fight-or-flight response to perceived threats. Deep breaths taken in for five seconds, held for two seconds, and then released for five seconds can engage your parasympathetic nervous system, allowing you to rest and digest, reducing overall stress and anxiety.
Physical activity and nutrition play crucial roles in how you respond to stress. A healthy body can lead to a healthy mind, and vice versa. Physical activity is an effective stress reliever while also improving your overall quality of life. Nutrition is vital since stress can deplete various vitamins, including A, B complex, C, and E.
Spending time on social media sites can be stressful, not just because of what you see there, but also because the time could be better spent chatting with friends, being outside enjoying the weather, or reading a good book.
Humans are social beings. You need to have connections with people to feel supported. Finding a sense of community, whether at work, with a religious organization, or through shared activities, such as organized sports, is important to your well-being.
Ensuring Adequate Sleep
Ideal sleep efficiency is 85% or greater. If your sleep efficiency is less than that, it indicates that you are not sleeping well and may need to adjust your sleep patterns to enhance the depth and quality of your sleep.
Regular Exercise for Improved Circulation
Exercise improves circulation by increasing blood flow, getting your heart to pump blood around your body more quickly, and flushing blood through your arteries. It also helps to prevent or reduce obesity, which is one of the leading causes of circulatory problems.
Supplements for Hair Growth
Supplements for hair growth boost hair health, including biotin, iron, zinc,
vitamin C
, and a marine protein complex. Furthermore, clinical tests have been undertaken to substantiate claims of thicker, fuller hair.
Biotin and Its Benefits
Biotin deficiency can cause hair loss, however, supplements can help with hair growth. However, there is no proof that biotin pills can promote hair growth in people who do not have a deficiency. Biotin is an essential B vitamin that aids the body's absorption of energy and nutrients from carbs, proteins, and lipids.
Fish Oil and Omega-3 Fatty Acids
Eating more whole fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids may help strengthen your hair, but there is little proof that fish oil supplements would do the same. One of the most intriguing purported benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, which are rich in fish oil, is their ability to help you grow long, glossy hair.
Iron and Zinc Supplements
Hair growth is no exception, and various nutrients are required for healthy hair growth, including vitamins A, C, biotin (B7), and D, as well as the minerals iron, zinc, and iodine. Together, these elements form the nutritional foundation for fuller, thicker, and shinier-looking hair.
Professional Tips for Healthy Hair Maintenance
Look for solutions that provide a deep cleansing while also targeting oiliness, grime, and grease on the scalp. Aim to wash your hair every two to three days, or sooner if needed. To prevent your hair and scalp from drying out, use a sulfate-free shampoo. Volumizing conditioners can be especially beneficial for straight hair.
Regular Trims to Prevent Split Ends
Trimming your hair every 6-8 weeks helps to remove existing split ends and keeps them from spreading farther up the hair shaft. Even if you're aiming to grow out your hair, frequent trims are crucial for keeping it healthy and vibrant.
Using Wide-Tooth Combs to Reduce Breakage
The wider spacing between the teeth and greater diameter make it simpler to untangle hair without causing hair damage. A wide-tooth comb has less friction than a regular fine-tooth comb. This characteristic makes the wide-tooth comb gentler on the hair and reduces breakage.
Protecting Hair from Environmental Damage
Rougher materials may induce frizzing and even breaking. If you want to take your hair care regimen to the next level, apply a leave-in conditioner or hair serum to your hair and allow it to soak underneath your scarf or cap.
Consulting with Healthcare Providers
It is important to have your hair loss problem diagnosed by a trichologist, even if you believe it is only male pattern baldness, as there may be other forms of hair loss diseases that require different treatment than male pattern baldness.
When to See a Dermatologist
A dermatologist should be examined at least once a year, if not more frequently. Many people begin seeing a dermatologist around the age of 12. This is about the age when you start getting acne and possibly warts. A dermatologist can advise you on acne treatment options as well as wart treatments and removal.
Diagnostic Tests for Hair Loss
Before reaching a diagnosis, your doctor will most likely conduct a physical exam and inquire about your food, hair care routine, and medical and family history. You may also have testing, such as the following:
Blood test
: This may help identify medical conditions that cause hair loss.
Pull test
: Your doctor gently pulls several dozen hairs to determine how many fall out. This helps to determine the stage of the shedding process.
Scalp biopsy
: Your doctor removes a few hairs from the scalp or scrapes samples from the skin to examine the hair roots under a microscope. This can help identify whether an infection is causing hair loss.
Light microscopy
: Your doctor uses a special instrument to examine hairs that have been trimmed at the base. Microscopy can help identify potential hair shaft disorders.
Creating a Personalized Treatment Plan
Many people find that minoxidil-containing products help them regrow their hair, decrease the rate of hair loss, or do both. It will take at least six months of treatment to prevent additional hair loss and begin hair regrowth. It may take several months to determine whether the treatment is working for you.
Conclusion
Whatever the cause of your hair loss, seeing your primary care doctor or a dermatologist will help you uncover the underlying issues. Early treatment for hair loss increases the likelihood of success. therapies may include modifications to your hair care routine, dietary improvements, and medical therapies that can be administered topically or taken orally. Even if your hair loss is inherited, there are therapies available to help halt or reverse it. If possible, consult your doctor about your worries and rule out any major underlying medical issues that could be causing your hair loss.
