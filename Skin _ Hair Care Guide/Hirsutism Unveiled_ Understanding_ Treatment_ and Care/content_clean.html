<p><b></b><span>Hirsutism is described as the presence of terminal coarse hairs in females that follow a male-like distribution. It affects 5-10% of women and is a prevalent presenting problem in dermatological outpatient departments (OPD) for cosmetic reasons. It is not only critical to determine the cause of hirsutism, but also to understand how to prescribe the best treatment depending on the primary causative element. The most essential factor in determining the diagnosis is a change in the shape and rate of hair growth. Understanding the causes and potential treatments is critical to optimal management.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is Hirsutism?<br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="What is Hirsutism?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_4_-_2024-07-02T134155.274_480x480.jpg?v=1719907929"/></div>
<p><span>Hirsutism is a disorder in which women develop excessive, male-pattern hair growth due to a variety of causes such as hormone imbalances, heredity, drugs, and medical illnesses. A proper diagnosis is required to identify the underlying cause and suggest appropriate treatment options. Understanding hirsutism can help women manage their disease more successfully and improve their quality of life.</span></p>
<h3><b>Causes of Hirsutism</b></h3>
<p><span>Hirsutism may be caused by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)</b><span>. This disorder, which frequently develops during puberty, creates an imbalance of sex hormones. Over time, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) can cause excessive hair growth, irregular periods, obesity, infertility, and, in certain cases, numerous cysts on the ovaries.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cushing syndrome.</b><span> This happens when your body is exposed to excessive amounts of the hormone cortisol. It can occur as a result of your adrenal glands producing too much cortisol or from long-term use of drugs like prednisone.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia</b><span>. This genetic disorder is defined by your adrenal glands' abnormal synthesis of steroid hormones such as cortisol and androgen.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Tumors</b><span>. In rare cases, an androgen-secreting tumor in the ovaries or adrenal glands might induce hirsutism.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Medications</b><span>. Some medications may lead to hirsutism. These include minoxidil (Minoxidil, Rogaine), danazol (used to treat endometriosis in women), testosterone (Androgel, Testim), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). If your partner uses androgen-containing topical treatments, you may also be affected due to skin-to-skin contact.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Hirsutism frequently occurs without a recognized reason.</span></p>
<h3><b>Symptoms and Diagnosis<br/></b></h3>
<div><img alt="Symptoms and Diagnosis" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_4_-_2024-07-02T153547.264_480x480.jpg?v=1719914756"/></div>
<p><b>Symptoms </b></p>
<p><span>Hirsutism is defined by the following symptoms:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Thick, coarse hair growth in areas where men typically grow hair, such as the face (upper lip, chin), chest, back, abdomen, and thighs.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Hair growth follows a male-pattern distribution, often appearing in a coarse and dark form.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>In addition to excessive hair growth, women with hirsutism may experience other symptoms related to hormonal imbalances, such as irregular menstrual cycles, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-nia-serum">acne</a>, and male-pattern baldness (alopecia).</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Diagnosis </b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Diagnosing hirsutism involves a comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare provider. The diagnosis typically includes the following steps:</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The healthcare provider will ask about the patient's medical history, including family history of hirsutism or other hormonal disorders, menstrual cycle irregularities, and medication use.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>A thorough physical examination will be conducted to assess the pattern and extent of hair growth. The healthcare provider may use a scoring system, such as the Ferriman-Gallwey score, to quantify the severity of hirsutism.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Blood tests may be ordered to measure hormone levels, including testosterone, DHEA-S (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate), LH (luteinizing hormone), FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), and prolactin. These tests can help identify underlying hormonal imbalances, such as elevated androgen levels or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>In some cases, imaging studies such as pelvic ultrasound or abdominal CT scan may be recommended to evaluate the ovaries and adrenal glands for any abnormalities, such as tumors or cysts.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Depending on the findings of the initial evaluation, additional testing may be warranted to rule out underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to hirsutism, such as adrenal gland disorders or ovarian tumors.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b> Psychological Impact</b></h3>
<p><span>Hirsutism can have a substantial psychological impact on a person's life, affecting areas such as self-esteem, body image, and social interactions. Here are some ways in which hirsutism might affect an individual psychologically:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Excessive hair growth, especially in conspicuous regions like the face, chest, and back, can cause feelings of insecurity and low self-esteem.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Hirsutism can have an impact on body image, causing people to be dissatisfied with their looks and leading to negative impressions.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Some individuals with hirsutism may withdraw from social interactions or avoid certain activities or settings due to fear of judgment or ridicule.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Hirsutism can impact romantic relationships and interpersonal interactions, leading to feelings of embarrassment or insecurity.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Living with hirsutism can cause psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, and feelings of isolation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The emotional burden of hirsutism may affect daily functioning, including work performance, academic achievement, and overall quality of life.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
