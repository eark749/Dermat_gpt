Understanding Eczema on Lips
Eczema on the lips, also known as eczematous cheilitis, is an inflammation or irritation of the skin on the inside of your lips. It is sometimes linked to atopic dermatitis. It can result in chapped, dry, scaly, or painfully cracked lips. Because it causes redness, scaling, and cracking on the lips, this condition can be extremely uncomfortable and embarrassing. Eczema on the lips may have a number of different causes, including genetics and environmental factors, though the exact cause is unknown. Some people may have a family history of eczema, making them more likely to develop it. Environmental factors like allergens, irritants, and harsh temperatures can also cause or aggravate lip eczema.
The following are examples of lip eczema symptoms:
Dry, cracked, or scaly skin on the lips
Redness and swelling
Itching or burning
Soreness or tenderness
Blistering or oozing in severe cases
Eczema on the lips, if left untreated, can cause discomfort and lead to complications such as secondary infections or scarring.
Lip eczema is typically treated with topical creams or ointments to relieve the symptoms and to address any underlying causes, such as allergies or irritants. Using a gentle lip balm on a regular basis can help to reduce dryness and cracking, while topical corticosteroids can help to reduce inflammation and itching. Eczema on the lips can be prevented in part by avoiding triggers like specific foods, cosmetics, or environmental elements that can result in flare-ups. Avoiding licking the lips and protecting them from the sun and wind can also help to prevent dryness and irritation.

Avoid harsh products
: Keep your skin from being irritated by harsh soaps, detergents, and other products. Instead, look for products that are gentle and fragrance-free.
Wear protective clothing

and guard against dryness and cracking. Look for a lip balm that doesn't have any scent and has emollients like petrolatum or shea butter.
Avoid scratching

Keep skin moisturized

Use gentle skincare products
: Use gentle, fragrance-free skincare products to avoid irritation and protect your skin barrier.
Avoid hot water
: Hot water can dry out the skin and damage the skin barrier. Use lukewarm water instead and limit your time in the shower or bath.
Protect your skin from the sun
: Sun exposure can damage the skin barrier and trigger eczema. Use sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher and wear protective clothing, such as a hat and long sleeves, when outdoors.
Managing Stress and Maintaining a Healthy Diet for Skin Health

Get enough sleep:
Lack of sleep can contribute to stress and inflammation, which can trigger eczema flare-ups. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.
