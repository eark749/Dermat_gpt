Natural Remedies for Monsoon Hair Care
Home remedies for hair loss in the monsoon:
Onion juice
:
The sulfur in onions adds thickness to the hair, making it the ideal remedy. You can apply the juice of one onion, depending on the length of your hair, to the roots. Leave it on for 20 minutes before rinsing it with a strong-scented
shampoo
to mask the onion smell. Repeat this twice a week and witness the magic. Here are three methods to use onions on hair.
Ginger
: Ginger contains vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids, which stimulate
hair growth
. This further promotes hair growth. Ginger also contains gingerol, which promotes blood circulation. Simply apply the juice of fresh ginger and leave on for 20-30 minutes. Wash it off with a gentle shampoo.
Oil massage
:
There is nothing that a good oil massage cannot remedy. Even hairs fall out! In a bowl, combine 1 teaspoon castor oil, 1 tablespoon of almond oil, and 1 tablespoon of coconut oil. Now, warm it up a little and thoroughly apply it to your roots and hair. You must give yourself a nice 15-20 minute massage with this. This will boost blood circulation and strengthen your hair follicles, while the heated oil will easily penetrate your scalp, making you feel calm as well. To achieve the desired outcomes, try repeating this process every two weeks.
Coconut milk
:
While eating coconut is wonderful for your skin and eyes, treating your hair to a coconut milk spa can help you reconnect with your hair again. Massage around a cup of coconut milk into your hair (the amount depends on your hair length). Wrap a towel around your head and leave it for 15-20 minutes. Rinse it afterward and repeat it at least once a week as a home remedy for hair loss.
Egg mask
:
Egg is one of my favorite ingredients to use in skin and hair care. Mix one egg with honey and olive oil. Using a brush, apply this silky hair mask to your scalp and hair. Leave it on for 20 minutes, then rinse it off. Don't worry, the egg scent will wear out after the second wash. Check out these egg hair masks.
Green tea
:
If you're concerned about persistent hair loss, use this to wash your scalp. Many times, our scalps become clogged with dirt, resulting in hair loss. Green tea will wash away all dirt particles, minimizing hair loss. Soak 1–2 green tea bags in boiling water for 5 minutes. Allow the green tea water to cool, then pour it onto your scalp and gently massage it in. You can also rinse it with regular water.
Aloe vera
:
Aloe vera's antibacterial characteristics make it an ideal addition to any hair care routine. Scrape aloe vera gel from a leaf or use at least 2 tablespoons of aloe vera gel to carefully massage your roots and hair. Rinse it off after 30 minutes. Apple aloe vera twice or three times per week.
Maintaining Hair Hygiene in the Rainy Season
Maintaining hair hygiene during the rainy season can be difficult due to increased humidity, rainfall exposure, and the risk of fungal infections. Here are some methods for keeping your hair healthy and clean:
Protect Your Hair From Rainwater
: Rainwater is often acidic or contaminated, which can damage your hair.  Wear a waterproof sweatshirt or scarf to protect your hair from the rain's impacts. If you can't prevent coming into contact with precipitation, wash your hair right away once you get home.
Establish a proper hair-washing routine
:
To remove deposits from your hair and scalp, wash it at least twice or three times per week. Use an antibiotic or antifungal shampoo to reduce germ buildup at your hair's roots. A leave-in conditioner is ideal for protecting your hair while also preventing frizz and dullness. You can also massage your head with heated oil before washing it. This will improve blood circulation in your scalp, making your hair stronger.
Keep Your Hair Dry
: You should take extra precautions to keep your hair dry during the rainy season because humidity is already high.  Overly wet hair may appear hefty and lifeless. After washing your hair, pat it dry with a fresh, gentle towel. Your hair's roots will be harmed if you tie it while it's still wet.
Use the Right Comb
: A wide-toothed comb is preferable for damp hair.  The hair is brittle at the roots and is more prone to breaking in the rain. Hair loss can be reduced by gently combing your hair with a wide-tooth comb to help it untangle more easily.
Keep Your Hair Short
: If you experience a lot of hair loss during the monsoon, it is best to keep your hair styled short.  Long hair is tugged and is prone to thinning. Trimming the ends of your hair improves hair growth by removing split or damaged ends.
Adopt a hassle-free hairstyle
: During the rainy season, it is best to style your hair as little as possible. Styling products and heat can weaken and damage your hair. Depending on the length of your hair, you can style it in a short braid, high ponytail, or tight bun.
Follow a Proper Diet
: Proper nutrition is essential for maintaining the health of your hair.  A healthy diet rich in eggs, dairy, walnuts, almonds, and green vegetables will enhance the luster and shine of your hair while also encouraging hair growth. Also, ensure that you are getting enough water into your body.
Show Some Extra Love to Your Hair
: Use a hair care product suitable for your hair type, such as a hair serum.  This nourishes your hair while also preventing frizz and damage.
Importance of Regular Hair Wash
The shampoo helps water effectively remove dirt, debris, and odors like smoking or sweat. Shampoos are also effective at removing oil. Sebaceous glands secrete an oil known as sebum, which keeps the hair moisturized. Moisturized hair is less likely to break and seems dry and frizzy.
Scalp Care Routine for Monsoon
Taking care of your hair during the monsoon season is especially important since increased humidity and moisture can cause frizz, dandruff, and hair loss. Here is a healthy hair care routine that can keep your hair looking wonderful and manageable during the rainy season.
Regular Cleansing
:
Regular cleansing is essential during the monsoon season since the increased humidity and moisture can cause oil, filth, and sweat to collect on the scalp and hair, causing a variety of difficulties.  Washing your hair 2-3 times a week with a mild, sulfate-free shampoo helps to remove impurities, preventing
clogged pores
and infections. It also helps to keep the scalp healthy, which promotes hair growth.
Use Hair Masks
:
During the monsoon, the battle against frizz is ongoing. To get an advantage, apply a hydrating hair mask the night before if you intend to wash your hair the following morning. This helps to prevent hair loss during the rainy season.
Frequent Hair Styling
: Frequent hair styling, particularly using heat products such as straighteners and curling irons, can cause dryness, breakage, and damage. Limiting your use of these styling procedures helps to protect your hair's natural moisture and integrity, decreasing frizz and boosting overall hair health.
Trim Your Hair Regularly
: Trim your hair regularly, ideally every six to eight weeks. This procedure prevents split ends from migrating up the hair shaft, resulting in more damage. Regular trims help to maintain your hair's overall health and appearance, keeping it fresh and vibrant.  Trimming also encourages healthy hair development by removing damaged and weakened ends, freeing up space for healthier and thicker hair to grow instead.
Protect from Rain
:
An umbrella or a hat can help protect your hair from the rain. Rainwater can weaken hair, resulting in frizz and breakage. If caught in the rain, use a microfiber towel to gently dry your hair without rubbing too hard. To reduce damage, avoid tying damp hair and instead let it air dry. To protect your hair, consider utilizing water-resistant hair products or braided hairstyles. Maintain a regular hair care routine, including cleaning, conditioning, and oil massages, to keep your hair healthy and manageable throughout the rainy season.
Drying Your Hair
:
Drying your hair properly is critical to keeping it healthy and preventing damage. To remove excess moisture without frizzing or breaking your hair, gently towel-dry it.  Rub gently to avoid weakening the hair shaft. Instead, use a microfiber towel or allow your hair to air dry naturally whenever possible. To avoid heat damage, set your hairdryer to low or cool. Keep the dryer at a safe distance to avoid overheating.  Regularly exposing your hair to excessive heat can cause dryness, split ends, and weaker hair. Take good care of your hair to keep its natural luster and strength.
Avoid Over-touching
:
Excessive handling of your hair can cause breakage and damage, so avoid touching it too much. When you continually run your fingers through your hair or style it, you create friction and stress on the hair shaft, weakening its structure. Furthermore, the natural oils from your hands might mingle with the hair's natural oils, making it greasier. Furthermore, excessive touching might disrupt your hairstyle and cause frizz.
Tips to Prevent Dandruff and Hair Fall
Dandruff and hair loss can be prevented with a mix of good hair care habits, a healthy lifestyle, and, in certain cases, medical treatment. Here are some excellent strategies for maintaining a healthy scalp and reducing hair loss:
Dandruff prevention techniques include regular washing, proper rinsing, scalp hygiene, avoiding hot water, moisturizing, eating a balanced diet, managing stress, and avoiding hair products containing harsh chemicals.
Gentle handling, avoiding tight hairstyles, a healthy diet, staying hydrated, limiting heat styling, avoiding chemical treatments, regular trims, scalp massage, supplements, and consulting with a
dermatologist
are all ways to prevent hair loss.
Monsoon Hair Care Myths and Facts

Myth
: Does oil massage inhibit hair growth?
Fact

Pamper your hair and mind on occasion by massaging with essential oils, which is a more effective way to promote hair growth and relieve other scalp ailments.
Myth
: How do you keep wet hair from frizzing?

Fact
: Use an anti-dandruff shampoo to get rid of it. Avoid getting soaked in the rain. Also, avoid using harsh chemicals during the monsoon season. To prevent frizz and damage during the rainy season, use a nourishing hair mask, herbal shampoo, and a leave-in conditioner.
Myth
:  Is it a good idea to cut your hair frequently?
