Severe hair loss can be distressing, but there are several treatment options available. This blog provides a complete explanation of hair fall treatment.
Understanding Severe Hair Fall
Alopecia or
hair loss
can affect either your scalp or your entire body, and it can be transient or permanent. It could be caused by genes, hormonal changes, medical issues, or just the natural aging process. Anyone can lose head hair, but men are more likely to do so.
Causes of Severe Hair Loss
The causes of this type of hair loss include:
A high temperature or serious infection
Childbirth
Major surgery, major illness, unexpected blood loss.
Extreme emotional stress
Crash diets, particularly those with insufficient protein,
Drugs, such as retinoids, birth control pills, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, certain antidepressants, and NSAIDs (including ibuprofen)
Identifying Symptoms of Severe Hair Fall
This is the most prevalent form of hair loss, which occurs as people age. Men's hairline on the forehead frequently recedes. Women's hair often has a broader portion. Receding hairlines (facial fibrosing alopecia) is an increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women.
Some people lose hair in circular or spotty bald areas on their heads, beards, or brows. Before hair loss, your skin may feel irritated or unpleasant.
Hair might loosen in response to a physical or mental trauma. Handfuls of hair may fall out when combing or washing your hair, or even with a gentle tug. This form of hair loss typically results in overall
hair thinning
, however, it is transitory.
Some illnesses and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can cause hair loss all over the body. Hair normally grows back.
This is indicative of ringworm. It may be accompanied by broken hair, redness, swelling, and, on occasion, leaking.
Impact of Severe Hair Loss on Overall Health
Hair loss can cause depression, nervousness, and social phobia. Depression can cause a depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, fatigue, and sleep deprivation. Anxiety can lead to excessive worrying, trouble managing those thoughts, and a sense of heightened tension.
Medical Treatments for Severe Hair Fall
Medical therapies for significant hair loss are divided into three categories: topical treatments, oral drugs, and surgical interventions. Medical therapies for severe hair loss include minoxidil, topical finasteride, hair transplant surgery, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy, low-level laser therapy (LLLT), and hormonal medications. The best treatment for hair loss is determined by the individual reason, overall health, and personal preferences. A healthcare practitioner can make personalized recommendations after a comprehensive evaluation.
Prescription Medications for Hair Loss
Prescription medications for hair loss are commonly used to treat disorders such as
androgenetic alopecia
and other types of hair loss. Here's a list of regularly recommended medications, including finasteride, dutasteride, spironolactone, minoxidil, topical finasteride, and corticosteroids.
Professional Hair Treatments and Therapies
Some treatments moisturize, strengthen, mend, and even add luster to your hair. Some popular procedures include deep conditioning, keratin smoothing, and scalp treatments. Each treatment addresses a distinct hair condition, and the best treatment for you is based on your hair type and needs.
Surgical Options: Hair Transplants
Hair transplants are a surgical treatment for hair loss that can give a permanent cure for people who have considerable thinning or
baldness
. Surgical hair transplant options include follicular unit transplantation, follicular unit extraction, direct hair implantation, and robotic hair transplantation.
