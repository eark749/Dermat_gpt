<p><span>This is the most prevalent form of hair loss, which occurs as people age. Men's hairline on the forehead frequently recedes. Women's hair often has a broader portion. Receding hairlines (facial fibrosing alopecia) is an increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women.</span></p>

<p><span>Some people lose hair in circular or spotty bald areas on their heads, beards, or brows. Before hair loss, your skin may feel irritated or unpleasant.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Hair might loosen in response to a physical or mental trauma. Handfuls of hair may fall out when combing or washing your hair, or even with a gentle tug. This form of hair loss typically results in overall <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-thinning">hair thinning</a>, however, it is transitory.</span></p>
