Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection. It has been around for a long time, yet it remains a major issue today. It is associated with the bacterium Treponema pallidum, often known as pale treponema. Hair loss is one of the symptoms that may appear as the condition progresses. What are its characteristics? How should it be managed? We take a careful look.
Understanding Syphilis and Its Impact on Hair
The majority of us will deal with
hair loss
at some point in our lives, making it a common concern. While a few strands of hair fall out each day is typical, anything more than 100 strands per day or visible symptoms of hair loss from specific areas of the scalp are cause for concern. When hair loss is caused by an illness or a medical condition, it becomes more dangerous. Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, is a bacterial skin infection that can result in hair loss. The process and relationship between syphilis and hair loss are described below, along with potential treatment options.
What is Syphilis?
Syphilis is an infection caused by bacteria. Most commonly, it spreads through sexual contact. The condition begins with a painless sore that occurs on the genitals, rectum, or oral cavity. Syphilis is passed from person to person via direct contact with these lesions. It can also be passed on to a baby during pregnancy, childbirth, and, in some cases, breastfeeding. After infection, syphilis bacteria can remain in the body for years without generating symptoms. However, the infection may become active again. Without treatment, syphilis can cause damage to the heart, brain, and other organs. It can be life-threatening.
How Syphilis Affects the Body
Without treatment, syphilis can cause damage to the heart, brain, and other organs. It can be life-threatening. Early syphilis can be treated with a single shot of penicillin. That is why it is critical to seek medical attention as soon as you discover any symptoms of syphilis.
The Link Between Syphilis and Hair Loss
Yes, syphilis can cause hair loss, as can genetics, hormone imbalance, stress, and an unhealthy diet. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease that causes sores and rashes on the skin's mucous membrane. Hair loss does not occur during the initial stage of the condition. Secondary syphilis hair loss, on the other hand, is common, with an incidence rate ranging from 2% to 7%. Hair loss during the secondary stage of the disease may be caused by lesions growing on the head. Aside from being exceedingly uncomfortable, rashes can damage hair follicles and disrupt the natural hair development cycle. Scratching causes damage to the follicles, which leads to hair loss. Another prevalent circumstance for hair loss is when there are no syphilis rashes on the head.  Hair loss can be in the form of patches or general thinning.
Symptoms and Diagnosis of Syphilis-Related Hair Loss
Syphilis is one of the reasons for localized hair loss. This highly contagious infectious disease progresses through four stages:
Primary syphilis causes an ulcer (chancre) where the bacteria enter the body (genitals, anus). It is extremely contagious and, depending on where it is located, may go unnoticed because it is not painful.
Secondary syphilis occurs when the primary form is not treated. The bacteria spread throughout the body via the bloodstream, resulting in a rash, especially on the hands and feet. Patchy alopecia may develop during this stage. Syphilis hair loss is not distinctive and may be confused with other types of hair loss, such as spot
baldness
. This adds to the complexity of the diagnosis. Furthermore, these symptoms fluctuate: they may disappear spontaneously without treatment in a few weeks, reappear, and then disappear again for one or two years.
Latent syphilis is the phase in which there are no symptoms.
In cases of tertiary syphilis, individuals may experience more severe lesions that compromise their heart, brain, bones, or nervous system if treatment is not received.
Identifying Syphilis Hair Loss Symptoms
Syphilitic hair loss is one of the symptoms of secondary syphilis. Recognising symptoms early may help in timely diagnosis and treatment. Patchy hair loss, diffuse hair thinning, associated skin lesions, and other secondary syphilis signs.
Diagnosing Syphilis: Tests and Procedures
Sexually active people should be tested for sexually transmitted infections frequently (depending on the individual). According to the CDC, the most common way to test for syphilis is via a blood test. Some will make a diagnosis by analysing the fluid from a syphilis sore.
Differentiating Syphilis Hair Loss from Other Conditions
Hair loss can occur for a variety of reasons, making it difficult to distinguish between syphilis-related and other conditions. However, certain characteristics can help distinguish syphilis-related hair loss:
Pattern, associated symptoms, timeline, and diagnosis of syphilis-related hair loss.
Other hair loss conditions include alopecia areata, androgenetic alopecia, telogen effluvium, tinea capitis (a fungal infection), and lupus erythematosus.
Treatment Options for Syphilis Hair Loss
Topical minoxidil is more likely to aid someone suffering from syphilis-related hair loss.
Minoxidil
is beneficial in accelerating recovery from telogen effluvium, which is a hair loss problem caused by other medical conditions, infections, and stressors on the body.
Medical Treatments for Syphilis
Penicillin is the chosen treatment at every stage. This antibiotic can destroy the germs that cause syphilis. If you are allergic to penicillin, your healthcare provider may recommend another antibiotic. Alternatively, they may propose a method that gradually helps your body become accustomed to penicillin.
Effective Hair Loss Treatments
Penicillin G, taken parenterally, is the primary treatment for all phases of syphilis. The preparation utilised (benzathine, aqueous procaine, or aqueous crystalline), dosage, and duration of treatment are determined by the disease's stage and clinical signs.
Lifestyle Changes and Home Remedies
If you're concerned about hair loss, you might want to try a home cure to see if you can prevent it from falling out. It is important to acquire a diagnosis and determine the underlying reason for your hair loss so that you can treat it effectively.
Supplements
:
Many vitamins and minerals are required for healthy hair formation and growth. Some nutritional deficits can cause hair loss. Vitamin D supplements may help relieve the signs and symptoms of telogen effluvium, or hereditary hair loss. However, further research is required to properly comprehend the relationship. Iron supplementation may help alleviate symptoms in iron-deficient patients. If people with low iron levels do not get enough
vitamin C
, they may benefit from taking supplements. Low vitamin D levels have also been linked to alopecia areata, a patchy form of hair loss caused by an autoimmune reaction. If people with this condition are vitamin D deficient, it is recommended that they take supplements. Zinc, riboflavin (vitamin B2), folic acid (vitamin B9), vitamin B12, biotin, and vitamin E are all effective hair loss supplements. Some small studies have found that an excess of vitamin A or selenium can cause hair loss, but more research is needed. Researchers are still investigating whether iron or zinc supplements can benefit people with alopecia areata.
Essential oils
: Essential oils are natural extracts derived from plants. Some essential oils may have qualities that promote
hair growth
. Currently, the data is almost purely anecdotal, and no studies have found sufficient evidence to demonstrate that any essential oil may be used to treat hair loss in humans. Most studies to date have relatively small sample numbers, are of poor quality, or were conducted on animals. Some people utilize essential
hair oils
for hair growth, such as peppermint, Chinese hibiscus, ginseng, jatamansi, and lavender.
Scalp massage
: Scalp massage may increase hair growth by increasing circulation and gene modifications, however, there is currently little data to support this claim. There is evidence that daily scalp massages lasting four minutes boosted hair thickness in nine non-balding Japanese men.  Giving yourself a scalp massage generally feels good, so even if it doesn't promote hair growth, you could find it calming.
Diet
:
Your diet may contribute to hair loss. Eating an antioxidant-rich diet can help alleviate the symptoms of oxidative stress, which is caused by environmental factors that harm hair follicles and contribute to hair loss. Many colored fruits and vegetables, including strawberries, blueberries, beans and legumes, spinach, and kale, contain high levels of
antioxidants
. Sugar, processed fats, preservatives, and alcohol can all lead to oxidative stress.
Quit smoking
:
Smoking can harm your hair cells, making them brittle and vulnerable to injury. According to studies, smoking increases the risk of premature graying and hair loss. Quitting smoking might be challenging, but a doctor can help you develop a smoking cessation strategy that works for you.
Regrowth and Recovery: What to Expect
Hair loss caused by syphilis may regrow after treatment if the immune system returns to normal. Secondary syphilis hair loss is treated by treating the underlying bacterial illness. Medications like penicillin or doxycycline are usually advised once syphilis is diagnosed. After treatment, syphilis-related hair loss usually goes away in a few weeks, but in rare cases, hair may not grow back until all of the previous hair has been lost.
Timeline for Hair Regrowth
Syphilis hair loss is not distinctive and may be confused with other types of hair loss, such as spot baldness. This complicates the diagnosis. Moreover, these symptoms are erratic; they could go away on their own in a few weeks without treatment, come back, and then go away for a year or two.
Tips for Promoting Hair Regrowth
Syphilis can cause hair loss during the secondary stage, which is known as "moth-eaten" alopecia. If you have syphilis-related hair loss, you should follow a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses both the underlying infection and promotes hair restoration. Medical treatment, a hair care routine, nutrition, supplements, scalp health, stress management,
hydration
, professional treatments, patience, and consistency can all help promote hair regeneration.
When to Seek Professional Help
Consult your doctor or
dermatologists
if you observe sudden or uneven hair loss, or more than typical hair loss while combing or washing your or your child's hair. Sudden hair loss may indicate an underlying medical condition that requires care.
Conclusion: Managing and Overcoming Syphilis Hair Loss
Managing and conquering syphilis-related hair loss requires a multimodal approach that targets the underlying infection while boosting hair restoration. The main measures are to treat the infection, maintain a gentle hair care routine, prioritize nutrition, protect the scalp, manage stress, stay hydrated, seek professional help, and be patient.
