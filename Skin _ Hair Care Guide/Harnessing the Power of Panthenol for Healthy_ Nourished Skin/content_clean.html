<p>Panthenol, also known as pro-vitamin B5, is a water-soluble vitamin that is commonly used in skincare products. It's a derivative of pantothenic acid, which is essential for human life and is found in a variety of foods. Panthenol is often used in cosmetic formulations due to its ability to improve skin hydration and elasticity. It's available in two forms: D-panthenol and DL-panthenol, with D-panthenol being the more stable and bioactive form. It's sourced from plants, such as rice, and can also be synthesized chemically.</p>
<h3>How Does Panthenol Benefit the Skin?</h3>
<p>Panthenol offers numerous benefits for the skin. It's a humectant, which means it helps the skin retain moisture, making it an excellent ingredient for hydrating and softening the skin. It also has anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties, which can help soothe and heal irritated skin. In addition, panthenol can help improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</p>
<h3>How Does Panthenol Help the Skin Barrier?</h3>
<p>The skin barrier is the outermost layer of the skin, which protects the skin from environmental stressors and helps retain moisture. Panthenol helps strengthen the skin barrier by increasing the production of lipids, which are essential for maintaining a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hydrasoothe-moisturiser">healthy barrier function</a>. This can help protect the skin from damage and prevent moisture loss, resulting in healthier and more resilient skin.</p>
<h3>Moisturizing Properties of Panthenol</h3>
<p>Panthenol's moisturizing properties come from its ability to attract and retain water in the skin. When applied topically, it penetrates the skin and binds to water molecules, which helps increase skin hydration and improve skin elasticity. This can result in softer, smoother, and more supple skin.</p>
<h3>Anti-inflammatory Properties of Panthenol</h3>
<p>Inflammation is a common cause of skin irritation and can lead to various skin problems, such as acne, eczema, and psoriasis. Panthenol has anti-inflammatory properties that can help soothe and calm irritated skin. It can reduce redness and swelling, and also help improve skin texture and tone.</p>
<h3>Wound Healing Properties of Panthenol</h3>
<p>Panthenol has been shown to accelerate wound healing by promoting cell proliferation and migration. It can help improve the appearance of scars and reduce the risk of infection. Its wound-healing properties also make it an excellent ingredient for treating acne, as it can help reduce inflammation and promote skin repair.</p>
