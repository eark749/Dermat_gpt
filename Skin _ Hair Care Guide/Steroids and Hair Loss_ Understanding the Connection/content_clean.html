<p><span>When you think of steroids, you immediately think of illegal performance-enhancing substances called anabolic steroids, which are used to gain muscle mass quickly. However, there are other types of steroids. Do steroids cause hair loss, then? Which kinds, if any? The side effects of steroids on hair vary based on the type of steroids you take and whether or not you use them safely (e.g., under a doctor's supervision). We will discuss various types of steroids, whether they cause or treat <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-fall-hair-loss">hair loss</a>, and how to protect your hairline if steroid use is necessary to treat a medical condition.</span></p>
<h2><b>How Steroids Affect Hair</b></h2>
<div><img alt="How Steroids Affect Hair" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/How_Steroids_Affect_Hair_480x480.jpg?v=1723552078"/></div>
<p><span>Increased levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are particularly damaging to hair follicles. DHT will adhere to the follicles and irritate them. Eventually, these damaged hairs will fall off. Many steroids enhance DHT levels in the body, resulting in substantial hair loss.</span></p>
<h3><b>Types of Steroids and Their Uses</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Types of Steroids and Their Uses" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Types_of_Steroids_and_Their_Uses_480x480.jpg?v=1723552079"/></div>
<p><span>Steroids are commonly used to treat hair loss disorders and come in a variety of forms. Topical steroids, intralesional steroids, oral steroids, and steroid-sparing agents are examples of steroids often used to treat hair loss and their specialized applications.</span></p>
<h3><b>Mechanisms of Hair Loss Due to Steroids</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Mechanisms of Hair Loss Due to Steroids" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Mechanisms_of_Hair_Loss_Due_to_Steroids_480x480.jpg?v=1723552079"/></div>
<p><span>Steroid-induced hair loss is caused by the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This occurs due to the action of an enzyme known as 5-alpha-reductase. DHT binds to hair follicles more strongly than testosterone, causing them to shrink and begin a shorter growth phase. When the hair follicles' growth cycle is disturbed, the hair gets thinner and shorter, resulting in the appearance of balding or thinning hair. Over time, the afflicted hair follicles may cease to create new hair strands, resulting in irreversible hair loss.</span></p>
<h3><b>Anabolic vs. Corticosteroids: Hair Impact</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Anabolic vs. Corticosteroids: Hair Impact" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Anabolic_vs._Corticosteroids_Hair_Impact_480x480.jpg?v=1723552078"/></div>
<p><b>Anabolic Steroids</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>People who are predisposed to <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/androgenetic-alopecia-causes-treatments-and-home-remedies">androgenetic alopecia</a> (male or female pattern baldness) may experience an acceleration of hair loss when using anabolic steroids. This is caused by the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which can decrease hair follicles and shorten the hair growth cycle.</span></p>
</li>
<li><span>Some anabolic steroids may promote excessive <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hair-regrow-serum%20">hair growth</a> (hirsutism) in women, particularly on the face and body.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Corticosteroids</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Corticosteroids can help with hair regrowth in disorders such as <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/alopecia-areata">alopecia areata</a>, in which the immune system assaults hair follicles. They help by lowering inflammation surrounding hair follicles and dampening the immune system.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Long-term corticosteroid use, particularly in high doses, can result in hair thinning or loss due to hormonal imbalances and systemic effects on the body.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Symptoms and Diagnosis of Steroid-Induced Hair Loss</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Symptoms and Diagnosis of Steroid-Induced Hair Loss" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Symptoms_and_Diagnosis_of_Steroid-Induced_Hair_Loss_480x480.jpg?v=1723552078"/></div>
<p><span>Taking anabolic steroids can cause excessive DHT production, resulting in genetic hair loss diseases such as male pattern baldness or female pattern <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/bald-patches">baldness</a>. At this stage, men may use hair loss treatment drugs such as finasteride to reduce the effects of the hormone.</span></p>
<h3><b>Recognizing Hair Loss Patterns</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Recognizing Hair Loss Patterns" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Recognizing_Hair_Loss_Patterns_480x480.jpg?v=1723552078"/></div>
<p><span>Male-pattern hair loss (MPHL) usually manifests as a receding front hairline, hair loss on the crown and vertex of the head, or a combination of the two. Female-pattern hair loss (FPHL) usually manifests as a diffuse thinning of the hair on the entire scalp.</span></p>
<h3><b>Medical Diagnosis and Tests</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Medical Diagnosis and Tests" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Medical_Diagnosis_and_Tests_480x480.jpg?v=1723552078"/></div>
<p><span>Diagnosing steroid-induced hair loss necessitates a thorough medical history, a physical examination, and different diagnostic tests. Here's a thorough breakdown of the procedure:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Medical history includes steroid use, family history, other medications and supplements, and underlying health conditions.</span></p>
</li>
<li><span>Laboratory tests include blood tests and scalp biopsies.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Differentiating Steroid Hair Loss from Other Causes</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Differentiating Steroid Hair Loss from Other Causes" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Differentiating_Steroid_Hair_Loss_from_Other_Causes_480x480.jpg?v=1723552078"/></div>
<p><span>Trenbolone and Proviron are the worst steroids for hair loss. Anavar and prednisone. When taking Trenbolone or Proviron, you may experience hair loss. Because proviron can impact DHT levels in the body, a change in DHT level might initiate a process that results in hair loss.</span></p>
<h2><b>Preventing and Treating Hair Loss from Steroids</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Preventing and Treating Hair Loss from Steroids" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Preventing_and_Treating_Hair_Loss_from_Steroids_480x480.jpg?v=1723552079"/></div>
<p><span>Preventing and treating steroid-induced hair loss requires a variety of techniques, including reducing steroid use, implementing supportive treatments, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Here's a complete guide to addressing both prevention and treatment:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Talk to your doctor about discontinuing or adjusting the steroid that is causing hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/scalp-solution">Minoxidil</a> (Rogaine) is a topical treatment that promotes hair growth and slows hair loss. Topical corticosteroids, such as alopecia areata, can reduce inflammation and promote hair regrowth.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>One treatment option for androgenetic alopecia is finasteride (Propecia), which works by preventing testosterone from being converted to DHT. Women who experience androgenic effects-related hair loss may benefit from taking the anti-androgen drug spirolactone.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Make sure your diet contains plenty of the vitamins and minerals—like biotin, zinc, iron, and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-vitamin-c3-serum">vitamin C</a>, A, and E—that are necessary for healthy hair.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Use gentle hair care products to prevent additional damage to thinning hair. Avoid tight hairstyles, which can lead to traction alopecia.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Practice stress-relieving activities such as yoga, meditation, and regular exercise, as stress can worsen hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Using platelets extracted from your blood, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy stimulates the growth of new hair on the scalp. In cases where other treatments have proven ineffective, hair transplant surgery may be considered in severe cases.</span></p>
</li>
<li><span>Consult a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">dermatologist</a> or trichologist regularly to monitor the condition of your hair and scalp and make necessary treatment adjustments.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Effective Treatments for Steroid-Induced Hair Loss</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Effective Treatments for Steroid-Induced Hair Loss" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Differences_Between_LAS_and_Other_Hair_Disorders_1_480x480.jpg?v=1723552078"/></div>
<p><span>There are effective treatments for certain types of hair loss. You might be able to reverse or reduce your hair loss. In some cases, such as patchy hair loss (alopecia areata), hair can regenerate without treatment within a year. Medication and surgery are both options for treating hair loss. The most prevalent choices include:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Minoxidil (Rogaine)</b><span>: Minoxidil is available over the counter (without a prescription) in liquid, foam, and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/shampoos">shampoo</a> form. For maximum effectiveness, apply the product to the scalp skin once daily for women and twice daily for males. Many people prefer to apply foam while their hair is wet. Many people find that minoxidil-containing products help them regrow their hair, decrease the rate of hair loss, or do both. It will take at least six months of treatment to prevent additional hair loss and begin hair regrowth. It may take several months to determine whether the treatment is working for you. If it is effective, you will need to continue taking the medication indefinitely to get the benefits. Possible adverse effects include scalp irritation and abnormal hair growth on the skin around the face and hands.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Finasteride (Propecia)</b><span>: This is a prescription medication for guys. You take a medication every day. Many men who use finasteride notice a slowdown of hair loss, and others may even see new hair growth. It may take several months to determine whether it is working for you. To maintain the benefits, you must continue to take it. Finasteride may not be as effective for males over 60. Finasteride's rare adverse effects include decreased sex drive and sexual function, as well as an increased risk of developing prostate cancer. Women who are or may be pregnant should avoid handling crushed or broken pills.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Other medications</b>: Other oral alternatives include spironolactone (Carospir, Aldactone) and oral dutasteride (Avodart).</p>
</li>
</ol>
