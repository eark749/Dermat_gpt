<p>Ketoconazole shampoo is a medicated shampoo that contains the active ingredient ketoconazole, an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections of the scalp such as dandruff, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/seborrheic-dermatitis">seborrheic dermatitis</a>, and tinea versicolor. Ketoconazole works by inhibiting the growth of the fungus that causes these conditions.</p>
<p>Ketoconazole shampoo is typically used twice a week for two to four weeks, or as directed by a healthcare professional. It should be applied to wet hair, massaged into the scalp, and left on for several minutes before being rinsed off. It may take several weeks of regular use for the full benefits of the shampoo to be seen.</p>
<p>It is important to note that ketoconazole shampoo is for external use only and should not be ingested. Additionally, if you experience any side effects such as skin irritation or allergic reactions, stop using the shampoo and seek medical advice.</p>
<h2><strong>How Does Ketoconazole Shampoo Work?</strong></h2>
<div><img alt="How Does Ketoconazole Shampoo Work?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/77_892d3404-0e9b-4adb-8787-271a794f41e0_480x480.png?v=1702294678"/></div>
<p>Ketoconazole shampoo is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections of the skin, such as <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/anti-dandruff">dandruff</a>, seborrheic dermatitis, and pityriasis versicolor. It contains the active ingredient ketoconazole, which works by disrupting the cell membranes of the fungal cells, preventing them from producing ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane. Without ergosterol, the fungal cell membrane becomes weakened, allowing the contents of the cell to leak out and the cell to eventually die.</p>
<p>Ketoconazole shampoo is applied to the affected areas of the scalp or skin, where it is left for a few minutes before being rinsed off. It is important to follow the instructions on the label carefully and not to use more than prescribed, as this can increase the risk of side effects.</p>
<p>In addition to its antifungal properties, ketoconazole has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-androgenic effects, which may contribute to its effectiveness in treating certain skin conditions. However, the exact mechanism of these additional effects is not fully understood.</p>
