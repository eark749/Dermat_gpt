<p><span>Integrating glycol soap into your skincare routine can result in smoother, more vibrant skin if done correctly. Here's a step-by-step guide for incorporating glycol soap:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Begin slowly</b><span>: Use glycol soap 2-3 times per week to help your skin acclimatize to the glycolic acid. If your skin tolerates it well, gradually increase the frequency to daily or as prescribed by your <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">dermatologist</a>.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cleansing Method</b><span>: Wet your face with lukewarm water to open your pores. Lather the glycol soap in your hands and massage it into your face in gentle, circular motions, avoiding the eyes. Rinse completely with lukewarm water to remove any soap residue.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Follow with a Hydrating Toner</b><span>: A hydrating toner restores the skin's pH balance and provides hydration.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Moisturise</b><span>: Glycolic acid can be drying, so use a good <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hydrasoothe-moisturiser">moisturizer</a> afterward to keep your skin hydrated. Use a moisturizer with moisturizing components such as <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hyaluronic-skinbooster-serum">hyaluronic acid</a>, glycerin, or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/ceramide-creams">ceramides</a>.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sun Protection</b><span>: Glycolic acid makes your skin more sensitive to the sun, therefore sunscreen is recommended. Every morning, even on cloudy days, use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Complementary Products</b><span>: To maximize the benefits of glycol soap, use serums with moisturizing, soothing, or brightening characteristics, such as hyaluronic acid or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-vitamin-c3-serum">vitamin C</a>. To avoid irritation and over-exfoliation, do not use other exfoliating products (like scrubs or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/aha-bha-range">AHAs</a>/BHAs) on the same days as glycol soap.</span></p>
