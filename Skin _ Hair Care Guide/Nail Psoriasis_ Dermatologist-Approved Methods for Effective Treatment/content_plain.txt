Nail psoriasis can be difficult to control, but there are various dermatologist-approved therapy options. This blog discusses several popular ways to treat nail psoriasis.
Understanding Nail Psoriasis: A Comprehensive   Overview
Understanding nail psoriasis is critical to optimal management. Here's a detailed summary, including definition, symptoms, causes, diagnosis, treatment options, lifestyle management, prognosis, complications, and follow-up care. Individuals who understand the symptoms, causes, treatment options, and management techniques for nail psoriasis can collaborate with their healthcare providers to effectively manage the illness and enhance their quality of life.
Identifying Symptoms: The First Step in Nail Psoriasis Treatment
Identifying symptoms is the critical first step in successfully treating nail psoriasis. Here's how you can identify common symptoms:
Pitting
: Look for tiny pits or dents in your nails.  These are frequently one of the first signs of nail psoriasis.
Discoloration
: Look for yellow-brown spots, oil spots, or nail colour changes.  Nails may also appear white or opaque.
Thickening
: Feel the texture of your nails.  Nail psoriasis can cause thickening or ridging of the nails, leaving them rough or uneven.
Crumbling
: Check the integrity of your nails.  Psoriasis can make nails brittle and prone to crumbling, particularly at the edges.
Onycholysis
: The nail will separate from the nail bed.  This can result in a gap between the nail and the skin beneath.
Subungual Hyperkeratosis
: Look for debris under the nail, which can be caused by psoriasis-related changes in nail structure.
If you notice any of these symptoms, you should see a dermatologist for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Early intervention can help prevent further nail damage and improve results.
Causes of Nail Psoriasis: What Dermatologists Say
Dermatologists blame nail psoriasis on a combination of genetic predisposition, immune system dysfunction, and environmental factors. Here's the breakdown:
Genetic Predisposition
: Psoriasis tends to run in families, including nail psoriasis.  People are more likely to get psoriasis if there is a family history of the condition. Specific genetic variations are linked to an increased risk of psoriasis.
Immune System Dysfunction
: Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues such as the skin and nails.  In nail psoriasis, immune cells accumulate in the nail matrix, causing inflammation and abnormal nail growth.
Environmental Triggers
: Stress, infections, nail injuries, and certain medications can all cause or exacerbate nail psoriasis.  Smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity are also linked to a higher risk of psoriasis.
Koebner Phenomenon
: Dermatologists frequently cite the Koebner phenomenon, in which psoriatic lesions appear near locations of skin trauma or damage. This condition can also impact the nails, causing the development or exacerbation of nail psoriasis following nail damage.
Associated Conditions
: Nail psoriasis is frequently connected with other types of psoriasis, including plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Individuals with certain illnesses may be more likely to develop nail psoriasis.
Differentiating Nail Psoriasis from Other Conditions
Nail psoriasis can be difficult to distinguish from other nail conditions due to overlapping symptoms. However, while diagnosing a patient, dermatologists take into account several important factors.
Nail Psoriasis vs. Fungal Nail Infection (Onychomycosis)
: Nail psoriasis is characterised by pitting, ridges, and discoloration (yellow-brown spots or oil spots), whereas fungal nail infections cause nail thickening, yellowing, and crumbling. Psoriatic nails may show signs of inflammation, such as redness and swelling near the nail folds, which are uncommon in fungal infections. Dermatologists may perform a nail scraping or biopsy to differentiate between nail psoriasis and fungal infection, as the treatment approaches are distinct.
Nail Psoriasis vs. Nail Trauma
: Nail psoriasis can resemble nail trauma, especially when psoriatic lesions develop following a nail injury (Koebner phenomenon). However, psoriatic nails often exhibit additional characteristics such as pitting and onycholysis. Dermatologists diagnose nail psoriasis based on a family history of psoriasis and the existence of other psoriatic lesions on the skin.
Nail Psoriasis vs. Lichen Planus
: Lichen planus is another inflammatory skin condition that can cause nail thinning, ridges, and splitting. However, lichen planus typically affects the entire nail plate and can result in distinct longitudinal ridges. Nail psoriasis usually affects multiple nails at once and is often associated with other psoriatic manifestations, such as skin plaques.
Nail Psoriasis vs. Nail Lichen Simplex Chronicus
: Nail lichen simplex chronicus is characterised by excessive nail biting or picking, resulting in nail damage and distortion. While the appearance resembles nail psoriasis, the underlying cause is behavioural rather than inflammatory. Dermatologists compare the patient's history and behaviour to distinguish between nail lichen simplex chronicus and nail psoriasis.
Nail Psoriasis vs. Nail Bed Tumors or Melanomas
: In rare cases, tumours or melanomas originating in the nail bed can resemble nail psoriasis. Dermatologists conduct extensive examinations and may perform biopsies to rule out cancer.
Proven Strategies for Managing Nail Psoriasis
Managing nail psoriasis necessitates a multifaceted approach aimed at reducing inflammation, improving nail appearance, and alleviating discomfort. Dermatologists recommend the following tried-and-true strategies:
1.Topical Treatments
: Topical corticosteroids can be applied directly to the nails and help to reduce inflammation.  This topical medication helps normalize skin cell growth and can improve nail psoriasis when applied to affected nails. Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are topical immunomodulators that can treat nail psoriasis.
2. Intralesional Corticosteroid Injections
:
In cases of severe nail psoriasis, dermatologists may inject corticosteroids directly into the nail matrix to target inflammation and promote healing.
3. Systemic Medication
: This oral treatment for severe nail psoriasis works by suppressing the immune system.  For nail psoriasis, a different immunosuppressive drug may be recommended, particularly in cases where no other therapies have worked. A retinoid medicine that may alleviate the symptoms of nail psoriasis and aid in restoring normal skin cell growth.
4. Biologic Therapies
: These biologic drugs can be very successful in treating nail psoriasis because they specifically target immune system components implicated in psoriasis.
5.Nail Care
: Keep nails trimmed short to reduce the risk of further damage and infection. Moisturize nails and cuticles regularly to prevent dryness and brittleness. Avoid trauma to the nails, such as picking or biting, which can worsen symptoms.
6.Phototherapy
: Light therapy, or phototherapy, can be used to treat nail psoriasis by exposing the affected nails to UVB light. This can help reduce inflammation and improve nail appearance.
7.Lifestyle Modifications
: Stress can worsen psoriasis symptoms, so use relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga to manage it. Quit smoking and limit your alcohol usage, as both habits might exacerbate psoriasis. Maintain a healthy weight and consume a well-balanced diet high in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.
8.Regular Follow-up with Dermatologist
: Schedule regular checkups with a dermatologist to monitor your condition and alter treatment as necessary. Communicate any changes or concerns you have about your symptoms to your healthcare professional.
It is important to collaborate closely with a dermatologist to create a treatment plan that is tailored to your unique needs and preferences. Many people suffering from nail psoriasis can improve their symptoms and quality of life by combining the correct treatments and lifestyle changes.
Topical Solutions: A First Line of Defense
Topical solutions are frequently considered the first line of defence in managing nail psoriasis due to their ease of use and lower risk of systemic side effects when compared to oral or injectable medications. The following are some commonly prescribed topical treatments for nail psoriasis:
Corticosteroids
: Topical corticosteroids are commonly used to relieve the inflammation and itching caused by nail psoriasis.  Creams, ointments, and solutions are available in a variety of strengths and formulas. Dermatologists may prescribe potent corticosteroids for nail psoriasis, which are usually applied directly to the affected nails once or twice a day.
Calcipotriene (Vitamin D analogue)
: Calcipotriene is a synthetic vitamin D that promotes healthy skin cell growth and reduces inflammation.  It is available in topical forms such as ointments and solutions, which can be applied directly to the affected nails.
Calcineurin Inhibitors
: Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are topical immunomodulators that are sometimes used off-label to treat nail psoriasis.  They are available in ointment form and may be prescribed for patients who have not responded to other topical treatments.
Tazarotene (Topical Retinoid)
: Tazarotene is a topical retinoid that promotes normal skin cell growth and may help with nail psoriasis.  It is available in gel or cream form and is usually applied once a day to the affected nails.
Salicylic Acid
: Salicylic acid is a keratolytic agent that softens and removes nail scales.  It is frequently used in conjunction with other topical treatments to increase their effectiveness.
Urea
: Urea is a humectant that
moisturises
and softens the nails, making them more responsive to other topical treatments.  It is frequently used in nail psoriasis preparations to improve penetration and effectiveness.
When using topical solutions for nail psoriasis, make sure to carefully follow your dermatologist's instructions and apply the medication as directed. Consistency is essential, and it may take several weeks or months to notice a significant improvement in nail symptoms. If topical treatments alone are insufficient, your dermatologist may suggest additional therapies, such as oral medications or phototherapy, to effectively manage your condition.
Lifestyle Adjustments to Alleviate Symptoms
In addition to medical treatments, lifestyle changes can help reduce symptoms and improve overall nail psoriasis management. Dermatologists frequently recommend the following lifestyle modifications:
Protect your nails from trauma and injury, which can exacerbate nail psoriasis symptoms. Avoid activities that can cause nail damage, such as biting, picking, or excessive manicuring.
Keep your nails short to prevent further damage and infection. Trim nails straight across with a nail clipper, then smooth the edges with a nail file. Keep your nails clean and dry to avoid fungal infections.
To keep your nails and cuticles from becoming dry and brittle, moisturise them regularly. Use a moisturising cream or ointment with ingredients like petrolatum, shea butter, or ceramides. Apply moisturiser after washing your hands or soaking your nails to seal in moisture.
Limit your exposure to harsh chemicals and irritants that can exacerbate nail psoriasis. Wear gloves when cleaning, dishwashing, or using harsh household cleaners. Choose gentle nail care products over acetone-based nail polish removers, which can be drying.
Stress can cause or exacerbate psoriasis symptoms, such as nail psoriasis.  Deep breathing, meditation, yoga, and progressive muscle relaxation are all effective stress management techniques. Engage in activities that help you relax and unwind.
Although there is no specific diet for nail psoriasis, eating a well-balanced and nutritious diet can benefit overall skin health. Consume a wide range of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Some people with psoriasis may find that certain foods cause flare-ups, so monitor your diet and any potential triggers.
Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, which promotes healthy skin and nails. Aim to consume at least eight glasses of water per day, or more if you are physically active or live in a dry climate.
Smoking can exacerbate psoriasis symptoms and reduce the efficacy of treatments.  If you smoke, consider quitting to improve your overall health and lessen the severity of nail psoriasis symptoms.
By incorporating these lifestyle changes into your daily routine, you can help relieve symptoms and manage nail psoriasis. However, you should consult with your dermatologist for personalised recommendations and treatment options based on your specific needs.
Home Remedies and Natural Approaches
While home remedies and natural approaches may not be enough to treat nail psoriasis on their own, they can supplement medical treatments and help with symptoms. Here are some home remedies and natural approaches that people with nail psoriasis might find useful:
Warm Water Soaks
: Soaking the affected nails in warm water can help soften them and relieve discomfort.  To provide additional relief, add Epsom salt or colloidal oatmeal to the water.
Moisturising Oils
: Applying oils like coconut oil, olive oil, or jojoba oil to the nails and surrounding skin can help to hydrate and soften them.  The best results come from massaging the oil into the cuticles and nails before bed.
Aloe Vera
: The anti-inflammatory and calming qualities of aloe vera gel may help reduce the redness and itching brought on by nail psoriasis.  Let pure aloe vera gel absorb into the damaged nails after applying it.
Tea Tree Oil
: Tea tree oil contains antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory qualities that may help lessen swelling and stop nail fungal infections.  Apply tea tree oil to the afflicted nails after diluting it with a carrier oil.
Apple Cider Vinegar Soaks
: Soaking their nails in diluted apple cider vinegar helps some people with the symptoms of nail psoriasis.  Soak the nails for ten to fifteen minutes in a solution of equal parts water and apple cider vinegar.
Dietary Supplements
: People with psoriasis may benefit from the anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 fatty acids, which are present in fish oil supplements.  Before beginning any new nutritional supplement regimen, speak with a healthcare provider.
Turmeric
: Curcumin, an anti-inflammatory substance found in turmeric, may help to reduce psoriasis inflammation.  Under the supervision of a healthcare provider, include turmeric in your meals or take supplements containing the spice.
Handling Stress
: Stress can aggravate psoriasis symptoms, including nail psoriasis.  To manage stress and enhance general wellbeing, try stress-reduction methods like yoga, tai chi, meditation, or deep breathing.
Dietary changes
: Some people find that cutting out certain trigger foods, like dairy, gluten, or nightshade vegetables, helps lessen flare-ups, even though there is not much scientific evidence connecting particular foods to psoriasis. Maintain a food journal to help you pinpoint possible triggers, and speak with a doctor or dietitian for individualised dietary advice.
It is important to note that, while these home remedies and natural approaches may provide temporary relief from symptoms, they do not replace medical treatment. Individuals with nail psoriasis should
consult with a dermatologist
to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to their unique needs and preferences.
Advanced Treatments for Severe Nail Psoriasis Cases
Dermatologists may recommend more advanced treatment options for severe nail psoriasis that does not respond well to conventional treatments. These treatments address the underlying immune system dysfunction, which can help improve nail symptoms and overall quality of life. Here are a few advanced treatments for severe nail psoriasis:
Biologic Therapies
: Biologic medications target specific immune system components involved in psoriasis and can be extremely effective in treating severe nail psoriasis.  Some biologics approved for psoriasis treatment include Adalimumab (Humira), Etanercept (Enbrel), Infliximab (Remicade), Ustekinumab (Stelara), Secukinumab (Cosentyx), Ixekizumab (Taltz), Guselkumab (Tremfya), and Risankizumab (Skyrizi).
Systemic Medication
: Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that shows promise in treating severe cases of psoriasis on the nails.  It functions by decreasing inflammation and reducing the rate at which skin cells proliferate. The usual dosage for methotrexate is one pill per week. Another immunosuppressive drug that might be recommended for severe nail psoriasis is cyclosporine. It functions by reducing the immune system's inflammatory response. Usually, cyclosporine is taken as a pill. Severe nail psoriasis can be treated with the retinoid drug actiretin. It functions by lowering inflammation and restoring normal skin cell growth. Acitretin is taken as pills to be taken orally.
Apremilast (Otezla)
: Apremilast is a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor that helps reduce inflammation by modulating the immune response. It is taken orally in pill form and may be prescribed for people with severe nail psoriasis who have not responded to other medications.
Targeted Phototherapy
: Using a specialised device, targeted phototherapy exposes the affected nails to ultraviolet (UV) light.  This targeted approach can help reduce inflammation and improve nail psoriasis symptoms while not exposing the rest of the body to UV radiation.
Combination Therapies
: In some cases, dermatologists may recommend combining different treatment modalities to improve results.  To treat nail psoriasis from multiple angles, a combination of biologic therapy, topical treatments, or systemic medications may be used.
Surgical Options
: In rare cases of severe nail psoriasis that does not respond to other treatments, surgical interventions such as nail avulsion (removal) or nail plate removal may be used.  These procedures are typically reserved for severe nail damage that causes significant pain or functional impairment.
It is important to note that these advanced treatments may cause side effects and should be closely monitored by a dermatologist. Treatment decisions should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider, taking into account the patient's medical history, disease severity, and treatment goals.
When to Consider Systemic Medication
Systemic medication for nail psoriasis is frequently recommended when topical treatments and conservative measures have proven ineffective, or when the condition is severe and has a significant impact on quality of life. Here are some situations where systemic medication might be considered:
Topical Treatment Failure
: If topical treatments such as corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, or calcineurin inhibitors do not effectively control nail psoriasis, systemic medication may be required.
Severe Nail Psoriasis
: When nail psoriasis causes significant functional impairment, pain, or psychological distress, systemic therapy may be required to improve symptoms and quality of life.
Extensive Skin Involvement
: If nail psoriasis is part of a larger psoriasis flare-up that affects large areas of the body, systemic medication may be required to address both skin and nail symptoms effectively.
Involvement of Other Psoriatic Manifestations
: If nail psoriasis is associated with other psoriatic manifestations, such as plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis, systemic medication may be required to manage systemic inflammation and prevent disease progression.
Chronic or Recurrent Flares
: Systemic medication may be helpful in achieving long-term control of symptoms for people with chronic or recurrent nail psoriasis flares that significantly impact daily activities and quality of life.
Preference for Oral Treatment
: Some people prefer oral medication over topical treatments because it is more convenient or difficult to apply topical treatments to their nails on a consistent basis.
Before beginning systemic medication for nail psoriasis, consult a dermatologist or healthcare provider. They will evaluate the severity of your condition, review your medical history, and recommend treatment options based on your specific needs and preferences. Methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin, and biologic therapies are some of the systemic treatments for nail psoriasis. The choice of medication is determined by factors such as disease severity, comorbidities, and treatment objectives.
The Role of Phototherapy in Treatment
Phototherapy, also known as light therapy, is important in the treatment of nail psoriasis, particularly when topical treatments have failed or when systemic medications are not preferred or contraindicated. Here's how phototherapy is used to treat nail psoriasis: UVB phototherapy, targeted phototherapy, combination therapy, maintenance therapy, and home phototherapy devices. Phototherapy should only be done under the supervision of a dermatologist or healthcare provider, who can monitor your progress, adjust treatment parameters as needed, and ensure your safety. While phototherapy is generally regarded as safe and effective for nail psoriasis, it may not be appropriate for everyone, particularly those with a history of skin cancer or other skin conditions. Your dermatologist will assess your suitability for phototherapy and recommend the best treatment plan based on your specific needs and circumstances.
H3: Cutting-Edge Biologics and New Therapies
Phototherapy, also known as light therapy, is important in the treatment of nail psoriasis, particularly when topical treatments have failed or when systemic medications are not preferred or contraindicated. Here's how phototherapy is used to manage nail psoriasis:
UVB Phototherapy
: The most widely used type of phototherapy for nail psoriasis is narrowband UVB (NB-UVB).  This treatment exposes the affected nails to UVB light with a specific wavelength, typically 311 to 313 nanometers. NB-UVB phototherapy reduces inflammation and slows the abnormal growth of skin cells in the nail matrix, which improves nail psoriasis symptoms.
Targeted Phototherapy
: Using a specialised device, UVB light is directly applied to the affected nails in targeted phototherapy.  This targeted approach allows for higher doses of UVB light to be delivered to the nails while limiting exposure to healthy skin, lowering the risk of side effects like sunburn or skin cancer. Targeted phototherapy can be especially beneficial for people who have isolated nail psoriasis or have not responded to other treatments.
Combination Therapy
: Phototherapy is frequently used in conjunction with other treatments, such as topical medications or systemic therapy, to increase its effectiveness.  Combining phototherapy and topical treatments can help increase medication penetration into the nails and improve overall response.
Maintenance Therapy
: After achieving improvement with phototherapy, some people may require ongoing maintenance therapy to avoid nail psoriasis flares.  Maintenance phototherapy sessions at regular intervals can help to maintain the benefits gained from initial treatment.
Home Phototherapy Devices
: Dermatologists may recommend home phototherapy devices for people with nail psoriasis who are unable to receive in-office treatments on a regular basis.  These devices apply UVB light to the affected nails and can be used with the supervision of a healthcare provider.
Under the guidance of a dermatologist or other qualified healthcare professional, who can track your progress, modify treatment parameters as necessary, and guarantee safety, is imperative when undergoing phototherapy. While phototherapy is generally regarded as safe and effective for nail psoriasis, it may not be appropriate for everyone, particularly those with a history of skin cancer or other skin conditions. Your dermatologist will assess your suitability for phototherapy and recommend the best treatment plan based on your specific needs and circumstances.
Promoting Nail Health through Prevention and Maintenance
Cutting-edge biologics and new therapies have transformed the treatment landscape for nail psoriasis, providing more targeted and effective options for patients. Some of the most recent biologics and emerging therapies being researched for nail psoriasis include IL-17 inhibitors, IL-23 inhibitors, IL-23p19 inhibitors, Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors, TYK2 inhibitors, and bi-specific antibodies. These cutting-edge biologics and new therapies provide potential possibilities for people with nail psoriasis, especially those who have not reacted well to standard treatments or are looking for alternatives to systemic drugs. However, you should consult with a dermatologist or healthcare expert to decide the best course of action for your specific needs, medical history, and treatment goals. Clinical trials are still being conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of these medicines, and future research may lead to further advances in the treatment of nail psoriasis.
Everyday Tips for Protecting Psoriatic Nails
Protecting psoriatic nails is crucial for avoiding further damage and reducing discomfort. Keep nails trimmed, wear protective gloves, avoid harsh nail care products, moisturise frequently, avoid nail biting or picking, protect nails from trauma, wear proper footwear, maintain a healthy diet, manage stress, and seek prompt treatment. By including these simple tips in your nail care routine, you can help protect psoriatic nails and relieve the discomfort associated with nail psoriasis. Working closely with a dermatologist or healthcare professional can also help ensure that you get the right treatment and management techniques for your specific needs.
Dietary Considerations for Healthier Nails
While no single diet can cure nail psoriasis, eating a healthy and balanced diet can improve overall nail health and may help relieve symptoms. Here are some dietary considerations for healthier nails:
Consume a diverse range of nutrient-dense foods from all food groups, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. A well-balanced diet contains the essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients required for nail health.
Biotin, also known as vitamin B7, is essential for proper nail growth. Foods high in biotin include eggs, nuts, seeds, whole grains, avocado, and salmon. Consider including these foods in your diet to improve nail health.
Omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory, which may help reduce inflammation caused by nail psoriasis. Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines), flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, and hemp seeds are all sources of omega-3 fatty acids.
To stay hydrated, drink plenty of water throughout the day.  Proper hydration helps keep nails moist and prevents them from becoming dry and brittle. Aim to consume at least eight glasses of water per day, or more if you are physically active or live in a dry climate.
Limit Your Consumption of Added Sugars and Processed Foods: Consuming too many added sugars and processed foods can cause inflammation and worsen psoriasis symptoms, such as nail psoriasis.  Limit your intake of sugary snacks, soda, processed meats, and refined carbohydrates.
Antioxidants protect cells from free radical damage and may also have anti-inflammatory properties.  Consume antioxidant-rich foods like berries, spinach, kale, broccoli, tomatoes, and bell peppers in your diet.
Although there is limited scientific evidence linking specific foods to nail psoriasis, some people may find that certain foods or dietary triggers worsen their symptoms.  Keep a food diary to identify potential triggers and discuss any concerns with your doctor.
Obesity is linked to an increased risk of psoriasis and can exacerbate symptoms.  Maintain a healthy weight by engaging in regular physical activity and eating a well-balanced diet to promote nail and skin health.
If you have dietary restrictions or are having difficulty obtaining certain nutrients from food alone, you should consult a healthcare professional before taking dietary supplements.  Biotin, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D are all supplements that may help your nails.
It is important to note that, while dietary changes can help with nail psoriasis treatment, they are not a substitute for medical therapy. Consult a dermatologist or healthcare provider to receive personalised recommendations and treatment options based on your specific needs and preferences.
Stress Management and Its Impact on Nail Psoriasis
Stress management is essential in the treatment of nail psoriasis because stress can worsen psoriasis symptoms, including nail involvement.
Here's how stress affects nail psoriasis and how to manage it effectively, including how stress triggers flares, aggravates itching and picking, impairs immune function, reduces treatment efficacy, and affects quality of life.
Stress reduction techniques, regular exercise, healthy lifestyle choices, time management, social support, and seeking professional help are all effective stress management strategies for nail psoriasis.
By incorporating stress management techniques into your daily routine, you can help reduce the effects of stress on nail psoriasis while also improving overall well-being. Working closely with a dermatologist or other healthcare provider can also help you receive personalised care that meets your specific needs and preferences.
