A variety of factors can contribute to hair loss, including heredity, hormonal changes, nutritional deficiencies, stress, and specific medical disorders. Hair loss can also be a prevalent concern for many people. The COVID-19 pandemic may not itself cause hair loss, but the stress, anxiety, and lifestyle adjustments it is associated with have the potential to exacerbate current hair loss or perhaps cause temporary hair shedding. It's crucial to remember that these suggestions are only general advice and that specific situations may differ. It's essential to speak with a dermatologist or healthcare provider for individualized guidance and treatment options catered to your unique requirements.
Understanding Hair Loss During COVID-19
One typical worry that people may have during the COVID-19 epidemic is hair loss. The stress and lifestyle changes brought on by the pandemic may hasten hair loss or exacerbate pre-existing conditions, even though the virus does not directly cause hair loss. Keep the following in mind regarding hair loss right now:
Telogen Effluvium
: Stress, illness, or significant life events can cause
telogen effluvium
, a condition that is characterized by excessive hair loss. This shedding occurs approximately 2-3 months after the triggering event. The COVID-19 pandemic and the stressors associated with it have the potential to cause telogen effluvium.
Emotional Stress
: Many people have experienced increased emotional stress as a result of the pandemic. Emotional stress, such as anxiety, fear, or uncertainty, can cause or exacerbate existing hair loss conditions, especially if you are genetically predisposed to them.
Lifestyle Changes
: During the pandemic, adjustments to daily routines, disturbed sleep cycles, dietary changes, and decreased physical activity can all have an effect on overall health, including the health of one's hair. Nutritional imbalances or deficiencies can have an impact on hair growth and cause hair loss.
Recovery from illness
: Hair loss may occur for some COVID-19 patients as they recover. The physiological stress a disease places on the body is thought to cause this condition, which is similar to telogen effluvium.
Causes of COVID-19 Hair Loss
Hair loss is not directly attributed to COVID-19. However, there are a number of COVID-19-related variables that might cause hair loss or aggravate pre-existing hair loss disorders. Here are a few potential reasons:
Significant hair loss indicates that this is a temporary case of hair loss. Stress on the body or mind, disease, or significant life events can cause it. The stress and anxiety brought on by the pandemic may cause telogen effluvium, which would accelerate hair loss.
Many people have experienced substantial emotional and psychological hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety and stress can interfere with the hair cycle, which results in hair loss. Emotional stress from unresolved medical issues, unstable financial situations, or social isolation can cause or worsen pre-existing hair loss disorders.
Hair loss is a potential side effect for some COVID-19 patients as they recover. A severe or protracted illness might alter the natural cycle of hair development, resulting in momentary hair shedding.
The pandemic has significantly altered people's way of life and everyday activities. Sleep apnea, dietary changes, and a decline in physical activity can all have an impact on the health of your hair. Inadequate nutrition, insufficient sleep, and sedentary lifestyles can all worsen hair loss.
People with severe COVID-19 symptoms may occasionally need to take drugs or undergo medical procedures that involve adverse effects, such as hair loss. For instance, a side effect of several drugs used to treat COVID-19 or its consequences could be temporary hair loss.
Types of Hair Loss Associated with COVID-19
While COVID-19 does not specifically cause any particular types of hair loss, some people have shown various patterns of hair loss during or after the COVID-19 infection. The following two types of hair loss have been linked to COVID-19:
Telogen Effluvium
: Telogen effluvium is a condition that results in temporary hair loss due to disturbances in the hair growth cycle. It frequently results from severe physical or emotional stress, sickness, or big life events. The rate of hair loss from the scalp increases during telogen effluvium. Before the hair growth cycle returns to normal, this shedding can linger for several months and usually starts two to three months after the event that started it. Telogen effluvium has been found in some COVID-19 survivors as a result of the psychological and physiological effects of the sickness.
Alopecia Areata
: An autoimmune disorder called
alopecia areata
results in uneven hair loss. There have been instances of people getting alopecia areata during or after COVID-19 infection, even if the precise relationship between the two conditions is still not entirely established. It is thought that the virus's immunological response may play a role in the development or flare-up of this illness.
It's important to remember that certain types of hair loss can occur for reasons unrelated to COVID-19. If you have significant hair loss or changes in your hair pattern during or after a COVID-19 infection, you should
consult a dermatologist
or other healthcare provider who specializes in hair loss. They can assess your specific situation, make an accurate diagnosis, and recommend appropriate management techniques or treatment options based on your specific needs.
When to Seek Medical Attention
If you experience any unsettling health-related symptoms or disorders, such as hair loss, it is critical that you consult a doctor. You should think about contacting a dermatologist or healthcare provider in the following circumstances:
Sudden or Severe Hair Loss
: If you notice a significant increase in hair shedding or thinning of your hair, you should consult a healthcare professional. Sudden or severe hair loss may indicate an underlying medical condition that needs to be evaluated and treated.
Hair Loss Associated with Other Symptoms
: If you have hair loss along with other troubling symptoms like scalp redness, itching, pain, scaling, or any other skin abnormalities, you should seek medical attention. These symptoms could be the result of an underlying scalp or skin condition that requires treatment.
Patchy or Prolonged Hair Loss
: If you notice patchy or complete hair loss (bald patches), it could be an indication of an autoimmune condition such as alopecia areata. A dermatologist who specializes in hair loss can assist with proper diagnosis and management.
Hair Loss After COVID-19
: If you have recovered from COVID-19 and are experiencing significant hair loss or changes in your hair pattern, you should see a healthcare professional. They can assess your situation and determine whether there are any underlying causes of your hair loss.
Emotional Impact and Distress
: Hair loss can cause significant emotional distress in people. If hair loss is causing you distress or has a negative impact on your quality of life, it's a good idea to seek help from a healthcare professional who can offer advice, reassurance, and appropriate treatment options.
Home Remedies for Hair Fall During COVID-19
There is no permanent treatment for hair loss, so it's crucial to seek a doctor's advice for an accurate diagnosis and course of action. However, there are some at-home remedies that may support hair health and reduce hair fall. Here are some recommendations:
Healthy Eating
: Maintain a vitamin, mineral, and protein-rich diet that is well-balanced. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, fish, nuts, and seeds are a few examples of foods to include. These foods offer vital nutrients that promote healthy skin, hair, and nails.
Scalp Massage
: Massaging your scalp gently can help increase blood flow and encourage hair growth. Every day, for a few minutes, massage your scalp in circular motions using your fingertips.
Aloe vera
: Massage your scalp with fresh aloe vera gel. It can hydrate the hair follicles and has soothing qualities. Then, rinse with lukewarm water after about 30 minutes.
Warm Coconut Oil
: Massage warm coconut oil into your scalp and hair. Coconut oil can be used to moisturize and condition the scalp, resulting in healthier hair growth. Allow it to sit for at least 30 minutes or overnight before shampooing.
Onion Juice
: Apply onion juice to your hair by extracting the juice. Sulfur elements found in onion juice may enhance blood circulation and encourage hair growth. Before rinsing with a gentle shampoo, leave it on for 30 to 60 minutes.
Avoid Harsh Chemicals and Excessive Heat Styling
: Avoid using harsh chemicals, hair dyes, and excessive heat styling tools, as these can weaken the hair and contribute to hair loss. Use gentle hair care products and avoid using heat on your hair.
Stress Management
: Use stress-relieving techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, yoga, or engaging in activities that you enjoy. Stress can cause hair loss, so learning healthy stress management techniques is essential.
Good Sleep Hygiene
: Make sure you get enough sleep because it is important for overall health, including hair health. Aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep per night.
Nutrition for Hair Health
Proper nutrition is essential for maintaining healthy hair. The following are some essential nutrients for hair health:
Protein
: Keratin, a type of protein, makes up the majority of hair. Lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, legumes, and nuts are some examples of foods high in protein that can help promote healthy hair growth.
Biotin
:
Biotin
, also referred to as
vitamin B7
, is necessary for strong hair growth. It can be found in a variety of foods, including eggs, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and leafy greens. Some people may benefit from biotin supplements, but it's best to consult with a doctor before beginning any supplements.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
:
Omega-3 fatty acids
support the health of the scalp and feed the hair follicles. Increase your intake of omega-3 fatty acids by including fatty fish (like salmon, sardines, and mackerel), flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, and avocados in your diet.
Iron
: A lack of iron is a typical contributor to hair loss. Lean meats, poultry, fish, legumes, and leafy greens are some examples of foods high in iron that you should include in your diet. By consuming foods high in vitamin C along with iron-containing foods, iron absorption can be improved.
Vitamins A, C, and E
: Due to their antioxidant characteristics, these vitamins aid in preventing free radical damage to hair follicles. Increase your intake of these vitamins by eating things like citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, almonds, and sunflower seeds.
Zinc and selenium
: These minerals aid in the growth and repair of hair tissue. Oysters, lean meats, poultry, legumes, nuts, and seeds are all good sources of zinc. Brazil nuts, fish, poultry, and whole grains all contain selenium.
Vitamin D
: Adequate vitamin D levels are necessary for the proper functioning of hair follicles. Spend time outside in the sun to allow your body to naturally produce vitamin D. Fatty fish, fortified dairy products, and egg yolks are all good sources of vitamin D.
Hydration
: Adequate water consumption is essential for overall health, including hair health. It keeps the scalp hydrated and increases circulation to the hair follicles.
Stress Management for Hair Fall
In order to keep healthy hair, stress management is crucial because stress can cause hair to fall out. The following stress-reduction methods could be useful:
Exercise
: Regular physical activity can help lower stress levels. Choose enjoyable activities such as walking, jogging, cycling, yoga, or dancing. Endorphins, also known as "feel-good" hormones, are released during exercise and can help improve your mood and reduce stress.
Relaxation Techniques
: Use relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation. These methods can help you calm your mind, reduce stress, and promote relaxation.
Prioritize Self-Care
: Schedule time for activities that you enjoy and find relaxing. Take up a hobby, spend time with family and friends, listen to music, read a book, or take a bath. Finding moments of relaxation and enjoyment can aid in stress reduction.
Get Enough Sleep
: Aim for 7-8 hours of good sleep per night. To promote better sleep, create a regular sleep schedule and a relaxing bedtime routine. Sufficient sleep is essential for overall well-being and can aid in stress management.
Practice mindfulness
: Mindfulness entails being in the moment without passing judgment. It can aid in calming down and reducing stress. To cultivate mindfulness in your daily life, try mindful breathing exercises, mindful eating, or guided mindfulness meditation.
Seek Support
: Speak with close friends, family members, or a mental health professional about your feelings and worries. Talking about your stressors and emotions can help provide support and perspective.
Time Management
: To avoid feeling overwhelmed, prioritize tasks and organize your time effectively. Break tasks down into smaller, more manageable steps, and set realistic goals. Learning how to manage your time effectively can help you reduce stress and increase your productivity.
Limit Stressors
: Make an effort to reduce the impact of stress on your life by identifying its sources. Setting boundaries, declining unwarranted commitments, or changing one's lifestyle may be necessary to promote harmony and reduce stress.
Hair Care Routine During COVID-19
To keep your hair healthy and well-groomed during COVID-19, you must continue your regular hair care routine. Here are some recommendations for a hair care regimen at this time:
Regular Washing
: Frequently wash your hair with a mild shampoo that is appropriate for your hair type. Cleaning your hair can help get rid of environmental pollutants like dirt, oil, and other impurities. If necessary, aim to wash your hair two to three times per week.
Conditioner
: To hydrate and nourish your hair after shampooing, use a conditioner. Apply the conditioner to your hair, avoiding the scalp, from the middle of the length to the ends. Before giving it a thorough rinse, let it sit for a few minutes.
Scalp Care
: Keep your scalp clean and well-maintained to maintain its health. While shampooing, give your scalp a light massage to encourage blood flow. Consider using a gentle exfoliating scalp scrub or consulting a dermatologist if you experience dryness or flakiness.
Hair Mask or Deep Conditioning Treatment
: To replenish moisture, repair damage, and improve shine, give your hair a deep conditioning treatment or hair mask once a week or as needed. Consider purchasing products that contain nourishing components like argan oil, shea butter, or coconut oil.
Avoid Using Heat Styling Tools
: Avoid using heat-styling tools like blow dryers, straighteners, and curling irons. Excessive heat can damage the hair and cause it to become dry. If you must use heat styling, use a heat protectant spray and the lowest heat setting available.
Protective Hairstyles
: Consider wearing protective hairstyles that keep your hair secure and minimize manipulation. This can help to prevent breakage and damage. You can also wear a silk or satin scarf or bonnet while you sleep, or you can wear braids, buns, or ponytails.
Hair Trimming
: Trim your hair on a regular basis to remove split ends and promote healthy hair growth. Trimming your hair every 6-8 weeks or as needed can help maintain its overall health and appearance.
Avoid Over-Styling
: At this time, embrace natural hairstyles that require little to no styling. Excessive brushing, backcombing, and the use of tight hair accessories can all lead to tension and breakage.
Balanced Diet and Hydration
: To support hair health, maintain a healthy diet rich in nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, as dehydration can disrupt your hair's moisture balance.
Overall Well-Being
: Pay attention to your overall well-being because it can have a positive impact on your hair health. To maintain a healthy body and mind, use stress management techniques, get enough sleep, exercise regularly, and eat a well-balanced diet.

It is not advised for use by women, particularly those who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
Hair Transplantation
: Hair transplantation is the process of removing hair follicles from one area of the scalp (typically the back or sides) and transplanting them into areas where hair is thinning or missing. A dermatologist or a hair transplant specialist will perform this surgical procedure. It is frequently used to treat pattern baldness and can provide long-term results.
Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT)
: LLLT stimulates hair growth and improves the health of hair follicles by using red light wavelengths. It is usually done with the aid of specialized equipment such as laser combs or helmets. LLLT may aid in increasing blood flow to the scalp, promoting hair regrowth, and decreasing hair loss.
Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy
: PRP therapy involves extracting a sample of the patient's own blood, processing it to isolate platelets, and then injecting the platelet-rich plasma back into the scalp. Growth factors found in platelets can promote hair growth and enhance the condition of hair follicles. A dermatologist or a specialist in hair restoration typically administers PRP therapy.
Scalp micro pigmentation
: Scalp micro pigmentation is a non-surgical technique in which tiny dots are tattooed on the scalp to resemble hair follicles. It can give the appearance of a fuller head of hair and is frequently used to disguise thinning or receding hair.
Hair Care Products for Hair Loss
Focusing on products that support a healthy scalp and hair growth is crucial when picking hair care products for hair loss. The following product categories include some that could be useful:
Gentle Shampoo
: Look for a shampoo that is gentle on the scalp and does not cause dryness or irritation. Shampoos containing harsh sulfates or chemicals that can strip the hair of its natural oils should be avoided.
Conditioner

Thickening or Volumizing Products
: If your hair appears thin or lacks volume, experiment with thickening or volumizing products such as mousses, sprays, or styling creams. These products can help to create the illusion of thicker hair.
Scalp exfoliators
: Exfoliating the scalp can aid in the removal of build-up and dead skin cells, allowing for healthier hair growth. Look for scalp exfoliating products with gentle exfoliants like salicylic acid or natural ingredients like sugar or jojoba beads.
Heat Protectant
: If you use heat styling tools like hair dryers or straighteners, it's critical to protect your hair from heat damage. Use a heat-protectant spray or serum before styling to avoid damage and breakage.
Avoid Harsh Chemicals
: Avoid using hair care products with strong chemicals because they can further harm your hair and scalp. When feasible, use goods with natural or organic ingredients.
Keep in mind that while hair care products help promote healthy hair, they might not totally stop hair loss or deal with its root causes. To find the best products and treatments for your unique problem, it's crucial to speak with a medical practitioner or dermatologist who specializes in hair loss. They can help you choose the best items by making tailored recommendations depending on your needs.
