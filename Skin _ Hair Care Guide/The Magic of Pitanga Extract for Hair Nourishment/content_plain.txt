Myth 1
: Pitanga Extract Can Instantly Treat
Hair Loss
.
Reality
: Pitanga extract has minerals that promote hair health and growth, but it is not a cure-all for hair loss.

Myth 2

Reality
: While Pitanga extract has several hair health advantages, its efficiency varies based on the kind of hair and condition. Some people may see considerable gains in hair strength, hydration, and gloss after using Pitanga extract, however, others may not. When determining the suitability of Pitanga extract for a certain individual, aspects such as hair texture, scalp condition, and current hair care routine must be considered.
Myth 3
: Using more Pitanga extract yields better results.
Reality
: Using excessive amounts of Pitanga extract or any other hair care product does not guarantee improved results and may even promote greasiness or buildup. It is important to follow stated usage guidelines and avoid overloading the hair and scalp with the product. A little goes a long way, and utilising Pitanga extract in moderation can provide maximum benefits without overpowering the hair and scalp.
Myth 4
: Pitanga Extract Can Replace a Proper Hair Care
Routine
.
Reality
: While Pitanga extract is beneficial to the hair and scalp, it is also important to follow a balanced hair care routine that includes cleansing, conditioning, and environmental protection. Pitanga extract can be used in a variety of hair care products and treatments to improve their performance, but it should not be used as the only solution for all hair care needs. A holistic strategy that includes washing, moisturising, and protecting measures is essential for maintaining healthy hair.
Myth 5
: All Pitanga Extract Products Are Made Equal.
Reality
