Cold cream is a type of facial cleanser and moisturizer that has been used for centuries to clean and hydrate the skin. It's made from a mixture of water, oil, and wax, which creates a thick and creamy emulsion that can be used to remove dirt,
makeup
, and other impurities from the skin.
The name "cold cream" comes from the fact that it feels cool and refreshing when applied to the skin. It's also known for its gentle and nourishing properties, which make it suitable for all skin types, including dry and sensitive skin.
Cold cream works by creating a barrier on the skin's surface that helps to prevent moisture loss and protect against
environmental irritants
. The oil and wax in the cream act as emollients, which help to soften and smooth the skin, while the water helps to hydrate and refresh.
To use cold cream, apply a small amount to your face and gently massage it in using circular motions. Use a warm, damp washcloth or cotton pad to remove the cream and any impurities from your skin. Some people prefer to leave the cream on for a few minutes before wiping it off to allow it to fully hydrate and nourish the skin.
Overall, cold cream is a gentle and effective way to cleanse and moisturize your skin. It's a classic skincare staple that has stood the test of time and remains a popular choice among people who value natural and nourishing ingredients.
What is Cold Cream Made Of?
Cold cream is made of a mixture of water, oil, and wax, which are emulsified together to create a thick and creamy texture. The specific ingredients and ratios can vary depending on the manufacturer and recipe, but the basic components of cold cream are:
Water
: This is the main liquid component of the cream and helps to hydrate and refresh the skin.
Oil
: Oils such as mineral oil, almond oil, or
coconut oil
are commonly used in cold cream to provide moisturization and nourishment to the skin.
Wax
: Wax such as beeswax or candelilla wax is added to cold cream to create a thick and creamy texture and to help create a barrier on the skin that prevents moisture loss.
Emulsifier
: An emulsifier is added to help combine the oil and water components of the cream and create a stable emulsion. Common emulsifiers used in cold cream include borax or beeswax.
Additional ingredients may be added to cold cream to provide additional benefits to the skin, such as
glycerin
,
aloe vera
, or essential oils. Overall, the combination of these ingredients creates a gentle and nourishing cleanser and moisturizer that is suitable for all skin types.
History of Cold Cream
The origins of cold cream can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Greeks and Egyptians, who used a mixture of oils, beeswax, and
rosewater
to cleanse and moisturize their skin. However, the term "cold cream" specifically refers to a formula developed in the 1800s by a French chemist named Théophile LeClerc.
LeClerc's cold cream formula was made of a mixture of
beeswax
, almond oil, and rosewater, and it became popular among wealthy women in France who were seeking a gentle and effective way to cleanse and moisturize their skin. The formula was called "cold cream" because it had a cooling effect on the skin when applied.
Cold cream continued to gain popularity throughout Europe and eventually made its way to the United States, where it was embraced by Hollywood stars and beauty enthusiasts alike. The cream was particularly popular in the 1950s and 1960s, and it remains a classic skincare product to this day.
Over the years, the basic formula of cold cream has been modified and adapted to suit different skin types and preferences. However, the core ingredients of oil, wax, and water remain the foundation of the cream and continue to provide effective cleansing and moisturization for the skin.
Cold Cream vs. Traditional Cleansers
Cold cream and traditional cleansers are both used for cleansing the face, but they work in different ways and have different benefits.
Cold cream is a type of moisturizer that is used to cleanse and moisturize the skin at the same time. It is a thick,
emollient
cream that is applied to the face and then wiped off with a tissue or cotton pad. Cold cream is particularly effective at removing makeup and dirt from the skin, and it leaves the skin feeling soft and supple. It is also gentle on the skin and can be used by people with sensitive skin.
Traditional cleansers, on the other hand, are specifically formulated to remove dirt, oil, and impurities from the skin. They come in a variety of forms, such as
foaming cleansers
, gel cleansers, and cream cleansers. Traditional cleansers can be harsh on the skin if they contain harsh surfactants or if they are used too frequently. However, they can be very effective at removing oil and impurities from the skin, which can be important for people with acne-prone skin.
In summary, cold cream is a good option for people with dry or
sensitive skin
who want to cleanse and moisturize their skin at the same time. Traditional cleansers are better for people with oily or acne-prone skin who need a more thorough cleansing.

Be gentle when using cold cream. Avoid rubbing or scrubbing your skin too hard, as this can cause irritation and breakouts.
