</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>The Science Behind Sun Damage</b></h3>
<p><span>Sun damage happens as a result of extended exposure to the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UVA and UVB rays are the two main forms of UV radiation that reach the Earth's surface and can both cause skin damage.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>UVA Radiation</b><span>: UVA photons have a longer wavelength and can penetrate deep into the layers of the skin. They are there all year and can pass through clouds and glass. UVA radiation has been linked to long-term skin damage, premature aging, and a higher risk of skin cancer. They can also penetrate the skin deeper than UVB rays, reaching the dermis, where collagen and elastin fibers are found, contributing to the breakdown of these supporting structures and causing wrinkles and drooping skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>UVB Radiation</b><span>: UVB rays are shorter in wavelength and predominantly impact the skin's outermost layer (epidermis). They are the leading cause of sunburn and contribute significantly to the development of skin cancer. UVB rays are more intense at midday and throughout the summer months, and their intensity varies depending on geographic location and altitude.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>UVA and UVB rays can both damage skin cells, resulting in a variety of negative consequences:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Sunburn</b><span>: Excessive UV exposure can cause sunburn, which is characterized by skin redness, pain, and inflammation. Sunburn is an obvious sign of skin damage and increases the likelihood of developing skin cancer.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>DNA Damage</b><span>: UV radiation can adversely damage the DNA of skin cells. Over time, the buildup of this injury may result in mutations and the formation of skin cancer.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Premature Aging</b><span>: Prolonged sun exposure speeds up the aging process of the skin, causing fine lines, wrinkles, sunspots, and a loss of skin elasticity.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Immune system suppression</b><span>: UV radiation can impair the skin's immune system, making it more vulnerable to infections and reducing the skin's capacity to heal itself.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Eye Damage</b><span>: Prolonged exposure to UV radiation can also harm the eyes, causing cataracts, macular degeneration, and photokeratitis (corneal sunburn).</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>The following sun safety precautions should be followed to protect the skin from sun damage:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Applying a broad-spectrum, high-SPF sunscreen to exposed skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Putting on protective gear such as hats, sunglasses, and long-sleeved shirts.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Seeking shade during the hottest hours of the day.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Avoiding tanning beds and other artificial UV radiation sources.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Individuals can reduce the risks associated with sun exposure and maintain healthier skin by understanding the science behind sun damage and taking proactive steps to protect the skin from harmful UV radiation. </span></p>
<h3><b>Skin Problems Caused by Sun Exposure</b></h3>
<p><span>Sun exposure can cause a variety of skin disorders, ranging from short-term impacts like sunburn to long-term effects like premature aging and an increased risk of skin cancer. Here are some of the most prevalent sun-related skin problems:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Sunburn</b><span>: Sunburns happen when the skin is overexposed to UV light. It is typically characterized by red, painful, and inflamed skin.  Severe sunburns can cause blistering, peeling, and, in extreme cases, heatstroke.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Photoaging</b><span>: Prolonged sun exposure can hasten the aging process of the skin, resulting in wrinkles, fine lines, sagging skin, and uneven pigmentation. UV rays damage collagen and elastin fibers in the skin, which are necessary for its elasticity and firmness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sunspots and Pigmentation</b><span>: UV radiation can cause melanin overproduction, resulting in sunspots, freckles, and uneven skin pigmentation. These darkened spots are frequently seen on the face, hands, shoulders, and other sun-exposed areas.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Actinic Keratosis</b><span>: Sun exposure causes actinic keratosis, a common precancerous disease.  It shows on the skin as rough, scaly patches, generally on sun-exposed areas. Actinic keratosis can progress to squamous cell carcinoma, a kind of skin cancer if left untreated.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skin Cancer</b><span>: Prolonged or repeated sun exposure is a major risk factor for developing skin cancer. The most common types of skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. These cancers can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most commonly found in sun-exposed areas such as the face, neck, arms, and legs.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Eye Damage</b><span>: UV rays can potentially cause eye damage. Excessive sun exposure without proper eye protection can aggravate a variety of eye diseases, including photokeratitis (corneal sunburn), macular degeneration, and cataracts.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p><b>Myth</b><span>: Men do not require as much sunscreen as women. </span><b>Reality</b><span>: Both men and women are vulnerable to the sun's harmful rays. While men's skin is thicker and has higher natural melanin levels, which provide some sun protection, they are still at risk of sunburn, skin damage, premature aging, and skin cancer. Men, like women, should prioritize sun protection.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Myth</b><span>: SPF-containing products for men's grooming offer sun protection. </span><b>Reality</b><span>: While some grooming products, such as moisturizers or aftershaves, may contain SPF, the level of protection they provide may be inadequate.  To ensure effective sun protection, experts advise using specialized sunscreens with broad-spectrum protection and an appropriate SPF. Men should use a different sunscreen that is made specifically for sun protection.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Myth</b><span>: People with fair skin only need to use sunscreen. </span><b>Reality</b><span>: People of all skin tones should protect themselves from the sun. People with darker skin tones are still vulnerable to sun damage and skin cancer, even though fair-skinned people are at a higher risk of sunburn and may be more susceptible to certain types of skin cancer.  All skin types are susceptible to UV ray penetration, so everyone should use sun protection techniques.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Myth</b><span>: Men's skincare routines should be minimal and exclude sunscreen. </span><b>Reality</b><span>: Sun protection should be a top priority in skincare regimens. Sunscreen ought to be an essential component of everyone's skincare regimen, even for men. Sunscreen helps shield the skin from the damaging effects of UV radiation, preventing sunburn, early aging, and lowering the risk of skin cancer, along with cleansing and moisturizing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Myth</b><span>: Men do not require as frequent reapplications of sunscreen. </span><b>Reality</b><span>: Regardless of gender, sunscreen needs to be reapplied frequently to stay effective. Sweating, swimming, and rubbing can all reduce the effectiveness of sunscreen.   When engaging in outdoor activities or being exposed to the sun for an extended period of time, it is recommended that sunscreen be reapplied every two hours or more frequently.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>The Reality: Men's Skin and Sun Damage</b></h3>
<p><span>Promoting sun protection and addressing the unique needs and challenges that men may experience depend on having a thorough understanding of the reality of men's skin and sun damage. Here are some crucial details:</span></p>

<h3><b>Sunscreen and Aging: What Men Need to Know</b></h3>
<p><span>Sunscreen is essential for avoiding sun-induced premature aging. What men should know about sunscreen and aging is as follows:   </span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>UV radiation and skin aging</b><span>: The sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a major cause of skin aging. UV rays penetrate the skin, causing collagen and elastin fibers to be damaged, which are responsible for the skin's firmness, elasticity, and youthful appearance. This damage causes wrinkles, fine lines, sagging skin, and age spots to form over time.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sunscreen as an anti-aging tool</b><span>: Sunscreen acts as a barrier that reflects or absorbs UV radiation, preventing it from penetrating the skin and causing premature aging. By using sunscreen every day, men can significantly reduce their exposure to UV rays, which slows down the aging process and lessens the emergence of premature aging symptoms.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Broad-spectrum protection</b><span>: It is important to pick a sunscreen that offers broad-spectrum protection, which means that it shields the skin from both UVA and UVB rays. UVA rays are responsible for long-term skin damage and aging, whereas UVB rays are primarily responsible for sunburn.  Using a sunscreen that offers broad-spectrum protection ensures complete defence against aging effects because both types of rays contribute to premature aging.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>SPF and its significance</b><span>: The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of a sunscreen reveals how well it protects against UVB radiation. Higher SPF numbers offer more protection, but keep in mind that no sunscreen can provide 100% protection. For proper sun protection, dermatologists generally recommend applying a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Daily and consistent application</b><span>: Applying sunscreen daily, regardless of weather or season, is critical for preventing sun-induced aging. UV rays can pass through clouds and windows, so it is important to use sunscreen even on cloudy days or when indoors.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Other sun-protective measures</b><span>: While sunscreen is essential, it should be used in conjunction with other sun-protective measures. Wearing protective clothing like hats, sunglasses, and long-sleeved shirts, seeking shade when the sun is at its strongest, and avoiding tanning beds or prolonged sun exposure all help to reduce the risk of premature aging.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sunscreen and skincare routine</b><span>: Men's skincare routines should include sunscreen. Applying sunscreen as the final step before going outside allows it to form a protective layer on the skin.  Additionally, choosing SPF-enhanced moisturizers, serums, or other skincare products can provide an extra layer of sun protection.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Sunscreen's Role in Preventing Skin Cancer</b></h3>
<p><span>Sunscreen is essential in preventing skin cancer, which is the most common type of cancer worldwide. Here's what men should know about the role of sunscreen in skin cancer prevention:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Protection from harmful UV radiation</b><span>: The sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a major risk factor for developing skin cancer.  Sunscreen acts as a protective barrier, reflecting or absorbing UV rays and reducing their penetration into the skin. Men can considerably lower their exposure to these risky rays by using sunscreen.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Preventing sunburns</b><span>: Sunburn is a blatant indicator of excessive UV exposure and is linked to a higher risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. By protecting the skin from UVB rays, which cause sunburn, sunscreen helps prevent sunburn.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reduced cumulative sun damage</b><span>: Skin damage caused by prolonged sun exposure, also known as cumulative sun damage, raises the risk of skin cancer. Sunscreen helps to mitigate this damage by reducing the penetration of UVA and UVB rays, which can cause DNA mutations and skin cell abnormalities, ultimately leading to cancer development.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Lowering the risk of melanoma</b><span>: Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer and can be fatal if not detected and treated early. Sunscreen, in conjunction with other sun-protective measures, is critical to lowering the risk of melanoma. Regular sunscreen use has been shown to reduce the risk of melanoma, especially when started at a young age.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The importance of broad-spectrum sunscreen</b><span>: It is critical to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB rays to effectively protect against skin cancer. UVA rays can penetrate deep into the skin and contribute to skin aging and cancer, whereas UVB rays are primarily responsible for sunburn. Using a broad-spectrum sunscreen offers complete protection from both types of rays.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consistent and proper application</b><span>: It is critical to apply sunscreen generously and evenly to all exposed areas of the body, including the face, neck, ears, and hands, to ensure optimal sun protection. Applying enough sunscreen and reapplying it as directed is critical for its effectiveness in preventing skin cancer, especially after swimming or sweating.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sunscreen as part of a comprehensive sun protection strategy</b><span>: While <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-sunprotect-sunscreen-spf-50">sunscreen </a>is an important tool in the prevention of skin cancer, it should be used in conjunction with other sun-protective measures.  Wearing protective clothing, seeking shade during peak sun hours, and wearing sunglasses and hats can help reduce the risk of skin cancer even further.</span></p>

<h2><b>Selecting the Right Sunscreen: A Guide for Men</b></h2>
<div><img alt="guide for sunscreen" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Blog_design_65_480x480.png?v=1688972664"/></div>
<p><span>Choosing the right sunscreen is critical for effective sun protection. Here's a guide to selecting the best sunscreen for men:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Look for broad-spectrum protection</b><span>: Choose a sunscreen that offers broad-spectrum protection, which means it shields you from both UVA and UVB rays.  This provides comprehensive protection against various types of UV radiation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>SPF (Sun Protection Factor)</b><span>: The SPF indicates the level of protection against UVB rays.  Dermatologists recommend using a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. Higher SPF values offer more protection but keep in mind that no sunscreen can provide 100% protection.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consider your skin type</b><span>: Different sunscreen formulations are appropriate for different skin types. If you have oily or acne-prone skin, look for oil-free or non-comedogenic sunscreens that will not clog your pores. For dry or sensitive skin, choose a sunscreen with added moisturizing properties or one specifically formulated for sensitive skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Water-resistant formulas</b><span>: Choose a water-resistant sunscreen if you plan to swim or engage in sweaty activities. Water-resistant sunscreens stick better to the skin and provide more protection during water-based activities.  However, it is still necessary to reapply after swimming or excessive sweating.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Choose a convenient format</b><span>: Sunscreen is available in a variety of forms, including lotions, creams, gels, sprays, sticks, and even powder. Choose a format that meets your needs and makes application easier. Always apply sunscreen liberally and evenly to all exposed areas.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consider extra features</b><span>: Some sunscreens include antioxidant protection, moisturizing properties, or specific benefits such as mattifying or anti-aging effects. Consider these features in light of your specific requirements and preferences.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Check for skin-friendly ingredients</b><span>: Look for sunscreens that contain skin-friendly ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, which are physical sunscreens that work by reflecting UV rays. When compared to chemical sunscreens, these ingredients are typically well tolerated and less likely to cause skin rashes or allergies.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Examine the expiration date</b><span>: Sunscreens have a shelf life that is typically represented by an expiration date. Because expired sunscreen may not provide adequate protection, it is critical to check the expiration date and replace any sunscreen that has expired.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Seek recommendations and read reviews</b><span>: If you are not sure which sunscreen to buy, seek advice from dermatologists, friends, or reliable sources. Reading product reviews and looking at product ratings can also help you make an informed decision.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Understanding SPF and Broad-Spectrum Protection</b></h3>
<div><img alt="SPF and Broad-Spectrum Protection" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Blog_design_66_480x480.png?v=1688973568"/></div>
<p><span>Understanding SPF (Sun Protection Factor) and broad-spectrum protection is essential when choosing a sunscreen. Here is a closer look at these ideas:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>SPF (Sun Protection Factor)</b><span>: SPF indicates how well a sunscreen protects against UVB rays, which are the primary cause of sunburn. The SPF value reflects how long it takes UVB rays to induce sunburn on protected skin versus unprotected skin. In theory, an SPF 30 sunscreen permits you to stay in the sun 30 times longer without burning than if you were unprotected. It is crucial to note, however, that SPF only reflects UVB protection and not UVA protection.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>UVA and UVB rays</b><span>: The sun emits UVA and UVB rays as its UV radiation. Sunburn is primarily caused by UVB rays, which also play a significant role in the progression of skin cancer. UVA rays can cause skin cancer and hasten the aging process of the skin. They also penetrate deeper into the skin. It is critical to protect yourself from both UVA and UVB rays because they can both harm the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Broad-spectrum protection</b><span>: Broad-spectrum sunscreens protect against both UVA and UVB rays. If you want complete protection from the full spectrum of UV radiation, look for sunscreens with the designation "broad-spectrum."  These sunscreens offer more thorough sun protection by shielding the skin from both short-term UVB sunburn and long-term UVA damage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>UVA protection is important</b><span>: While SPF indicates the degree of UVB protection, UVA protection must also be taken into account. UVA rays can damage skin over time, speed up the aging process, and increase the risk of skin cancer. When choosing a sunscreen, look for active ingredients such as avobenzone, zinc oxide, or titanium dioxide, which provide UVA protection.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Combination of SPF and broad-spectrum protection</b><span>: To ensure the best level of UVB and UVA protection, pick a sunscreen with a high SPF (30 or higher) for UVB protection. This mixture lessens the signs of early aging, lowers the risk of skin cancer, and helps protect the skin from sunburn.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b> Tips for Choosing a Men's Sunscreen</b></h3>
<p><span>Take into account the following advice when selecting a sunscreen designed especially for men:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Pick a sunscreen with a non-greasy formula</b><span>: Men frequently favor sunscreens that feel airy and non-greasy on the skin. Choose formulas with a matte finish or an oil-free finish to avoid a sticky or shiny residue.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consider your skin type</b><span>: When choosing a sunscreen, take your skin type into consideration. To avoid clogged pores if you have oily or acne-prone skin, choose a sunscreen that is oil-free and non-comedogenic. Look for sunscreens with added moisturizing properties or those created especially for sensitive skin if you have dry or sensitive skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Take a look at the application format</b><span>: If you are picking a sunscreen, think about how easy it is to apply. While some men might prefer spreadable creams or lotions, others might find sticks or sprays to be more useful. Select a format that meets your needs and streamlines the application process.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Water-resistant formula</b><span>: Choose a water-resistant sunscreen if you plan to sweat or participate in water activities. This type of sunscreen adheres better to the skin and lasts longer during water-based activities.  Remember that water resistance does not imply complete waterproof protection, so reapply after swimming or excessive sweating.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Fragrance-free option</b><span>: Some men prefer fragrance-free products, particularly if they have sensitive skin or are sensitive to strong scents.  To avoid skin irritations or unpleasant odors, look for sunscreens that are labeled as fragrance-free or with minimal fragrance. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consider the following features</b><span>: Some sunscreens include extra features or benefits, such as antioxidant protection, anti-aging properties, or moisturizing properties. Depending on your specific requirements, you may choose a sunscreen that offers these additional benefits in addition to sun protection.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Check for skin-friendly ingredients</b><span>: Look for sunscreens that contain skin-friendly ingredients, such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, which are physical sunscreens that work by reflecting UV rays. When compared to chemical sunscreens, these ingredients are generally well-tolerated and are less likely to cause skin irritation or allergies.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Examine the expiration date</b><span>: Sunscreen has an expiration date, so check the packaging for this information. Because expired sunscreen may not provide adequate protection, it is critical to use new products for maximum sun protection.</span></p>
</li>

<h2><b>Incorporating Sunscreen into Your Daily Routine</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Sunscreen into Your Daily Routine" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Blog_design_63_480x480.png?v=1688972593"/></div>
<p><span>Including sunscreen in your daily routine is critical for protecting your skin from the sun's damaging rays. Here are some pointers to help you incorporate sunscreen into your skincare routine:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Select a sunscreen with a texture that appeals to you</b><span>: Find a sunscreen that feels good on your skin and meets your needs. Whether you prefer a lightweight lotion, a moisturizing cream, or a quick-drying gel, choosing a texture that appeals to you will make it easier to incorporate into your routine.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Make it a morning habit</b><span>: As part of your morning skincare routine, apply sunscreen. It should ideally be the last step before leaving. You're more likely to remember and use sunscreen if you make it a habit.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Apply it generously</b><span>: Apply enough sunscreen to adequately cover all exposed areas of your skin. A teaspoon (5ml) for your face and a shot glass-sized amount (30ml) for your body is a good starting point. Do not forget about commonly overlooked areas such as the ears, neck, hands, and feet.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Layer it with other skincare products</b><span>: If you use moisturizers or serums in your skincare regimen, you can apply sunscreen after they have had a chance to absorb. Before putting sunscreen on top, give each product time to absorb into the skin. If your sunscreen has moisturizing qualities, you can apply it after applying moisturizer to double up as both.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Think about using a facial moisturizer that contains SPF</b><span>: You can choose a facial moisturizer that already contains SPF to simplify your routine. This way, you can moisturize and protect your skin from the sun in one step.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Always have a small bottle of sunscreen on hand</b><span>: A tiny bottle of sunscreen is a smart idea to bring along. This will enable you to reapply sunscreen as needed throughout the day, which is crucial if you plan to spend a lot of time outside. Remember to reapply every two hours or more frequently if you're sweating or swimming.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Don't forget about daily sun exposure</b><span>: Even on cloudy or overcast days, UV rays can still penetrate your skin and cause damage. Regardless of the season or weather, include sunscreen in your daily routine.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Set reminders if necessary</b><span>: If you have a habit of forgetting to apply sunscreen, set reminders on your phone or keep them visible near your other skincare products as a visual cue. This can assist you in developing the habit of consistently applying sunscreen.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>How and When to Apply Sunscreen</b></h3>
<p><span>For effective sun protection, sunscreen must be applied correctly and at the appropriate time. Here's a guide to applying sunscreen and when to do so:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Choose the right sunscreen</b><span>: Choose a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher. Look for a lotion, cream, gel, or spray that is appropriate for your skin type and preferences.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Apply sunscreen 15-30 minutes before sun exposure</b><span>: It is critical to apply sunscreen 15-30 minutes before going outside to allow time for it to be absorbed into the skin. This ensures that the sunscreen is completely effective when exposed to sunlight.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Apply enough sunscreen</b><span>: Use a generous amount of sunscreen to adequately cover all exposed areas of your skin. A teaspoon (5ml) for your face and a shot glass-sized amount (30ml) for your body is a good starting point. Do not forget about commonly overlooked areas such as the ears, neck, hands, and feet.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reapply sunscreen every two hours</b><span>: The effectiveness of sunscreen fades over time, especially when exposed to sunlight, sweating, or swimming. Reapply sunscreen every two hours at the very least, and more frequently if you are sweating profusely or participating in water-based activities. Set reminders or use travel-sized sunscreen to make reapplication easier.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reapply sunscreen after towel drying</b><span>: If you towel dry yourself after swimming or excessive sweating, make sure to reapply sunscreen.  The protective layer of sunscreen can be removed by towel drying, reducing its effectiveness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Do not forget about commonly overlooked areas</b><span>:  Apply sunscreen to commonly overlooked areas such as the scalp (if not covered by hair), lips (use SPF lip balm), back of the neck, tops of the ears, and the underside of the chin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consider your activities and exposure time</b><span>: If you intend to spend extended periods of time outside, especially between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., take extra precautions.  Seek out the shade, wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses, and reapply sunscreen on a regular basis.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Check the expiration date of the sunscreen</b><span>: The shelf life of sunscreen is usually indicated by an expiration date.  Because expired sunscreen may not provide adequate protection, it is critical to use new products. Sunscreen that has expired should be discarded and replaced.  </span></p>
</li>
