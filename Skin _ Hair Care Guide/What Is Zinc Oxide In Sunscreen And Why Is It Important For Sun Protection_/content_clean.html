<h2><b>How Does Zinc Oxide Work In Sunscreen?</b></h2>
<div><img alt="How Does Zinc Oxide Work In Sunscreen?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/23_cb1985d9-021c-4f89-b2b5-efda95d62909_480x480.png?v=1699597605"/></div>
<p><span>Zinc oxide works in sunscreen by forming a physical barrier on the surface of the skin that reflects and scatters UV radiation away from the skin. This physical barrier is formed when zinc oxide particles are applied to the skin and create a protective layer that sits on top of the skin.</span></p>
<p><span>When UV radiation from the sun hits the skin, it can be absorbed by the skin or reflected back into the air. Chemical sunscreens work by absorbing the UV radiation and converting it into heat, which is then released from the skin. However, zinc oxide works differently.</span></p>
<p><span>Zinc oxide is a mineral compound that is able to reflect and scatter both UVA and UVB rays away from the skin. This is because zinc oxide particles are large enough to reflect the radiation before it can penetrate the skin. This means that the UV radiation never reaches the skin, reducing the risk of damage from the sun.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to providing effective sun protection, zinc oxide is also non-irritating and non-allergenic, making it a good option for those with sensitive skin. It is also water-resistant, which means that it will remain effective even when exposed to water.</span></p>
<p><span>Overall, zinc oxide is an effective and safe ingredient in sunscreens that can help protect your skin from the harmful effects of the sun.</span></p>
