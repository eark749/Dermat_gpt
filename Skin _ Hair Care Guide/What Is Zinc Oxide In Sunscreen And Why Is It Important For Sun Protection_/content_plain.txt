hyperpigmentation
, and increase the risk of skin cancer, while UVB rays are responsible for
sunburn
and also contribute to the development of
skin cancer
.
In addition to providing effective sun protection, zinc oxide is also well-tolerated by most skin types, including those with
sensitive skin
. It is less likely to cause irritation or allergic reactions than some chemical sunscreens, making it a good option for those with reactive skin.
Overall, zinc oxide is an important ingredient in sunscreens and can help protect your skin from the damaging effects of the sun. When choosing a sunscreen, look for one that contains zinc oxide and follow the recommended application guidelines to ensure you're getting adequate protection.
How Does Zinc Oxide Work In Sunscreen?
Zinc oxide works in sunscreen by forming a physical barrier on the surface of the skin that reflects and scatters UV radiation away from the skin. This physical barrier is formed when zinc oxide particles are applied to the skin and create a protective layer that sits on top of the skin.
When UV radiation from the sun hits the skin, it can be absorbed by the skin or reflected back into the air. Chemical sunscreens work by absorbing the UV radiation and converting it into heat, which is then released from the skin. However, zinc oxide works differently.
Zinc oxide is a mineral compound that is able to reflect and scatter both UVA and UVB rays away from the skin. This is because zinc oxide particles are large enough to reflect the radiation before it can penetrate the skin. This means that the UV radiation never reaches the skin, reducing the risk of damage from the sun.
In addition to providing effective sun protection, zinc oxide is also non-irritating and non-allergenic, making it a good option for those with sensitive skin. It is also water-resistant, which means that it will remain effective even when exposed to water.
Overall, zinc oxide is an effective and safe ingredient in sunscreens that can help protect your skin from the harmful effects of the sun.
