Understanding Dermaplaning: A Closer Look at the Treatment
Dermaplaning is typically performed by a trained skincare professional or licensed aesthetician. Here's an overview of the typical steps involved in the dermaplaning procedure:
Preparation:
The skin is cleansed thoroughly to remove any makeup, oil, or debris. This step ensures a clean surface for the procedure and reduces the risk of infection.
Skin Assessment:
The aesthetician assesses the client's skin to identify any areas of concern, such as acne, lesions, or sensitive areas. This helps determine the appropriate technique and pressure to be used during the procedure.
Application of Lubricant:
A lubricating gel or oil may be applied to the skin to provide slip and minimise friction during the dermaplaning process. This helps the scalpel glide smoothly over the skin's surface.
Dermaplaning:
Using a sterile surgical scalpel, the aesthetician gently scrapes the skin at a 45-degree angle. The scalpel is held taut against the skin, and short, swift strokes are made in the direction of hair growth. This process removes dead skin cells and fine vellus hair (peach fuzz) from the surface of the skin.
Post-Treatment Care:
After dermaplaning is completed, any remaining residue from the lubricant is removed, and the skin may be cleansed again to ensure it is free of any debris. Depending on the individual's skin sensitivity, a soothing toner or hydrating serum may be applied to calm the skin and promote healing.
Sun Protection:
It's essential to apply
sunscreen
with a high SPF after dermaplaning to protect the newly exposed skin from sun damage. Sunscreen helps prevent
hyperpigmentation
and premature ageing caused by UV radiation.
DERMATICA RAY: Protect Barelyon Fluid Sunscreen SPF 50
is a good choice.
Follow-Up Recommendations:
The aesthetician may provide post-treatment instructions, including skincare recommendations and advice on when to schedule the next dermaplaning session. They may also advise against certain activities, such as vigorous exercise or exposure to direct sunlight, immediately following the procedure.
Overall, dermaplaning is a relatively quick and straightforward procedure that can be performed in a clinical setting. It typically takes about 30 to 45 minutes to complete, depending on the size of the treatment area and any additional skincare services provided.
The Science Behind Dermaplaning: How It Works for Skin Rejuvenation
Dermaplaning for glowing skin is basically a cosmetic procedure that involves gently scraping the surface of the skin with a surgical scalpel to remove dead skin cells and fine vellus hair (peach fuzz). Here's the science behind it:
Exfoliation
:
Dermaplaning provides a manual form of skin exfoliation. By removing dead skin cells from the outermost layer of the skin (epidermis), it promotes cell turnover and reveals smoother, brighter skin underneath. Skin rejuvenation is achieved through Dermaplaning procedure.
Stimulation of Cell Renewal:
The scraping action of dermaplaning triggers the skin's natural healing process. This stimulation can lead to increased production of collagen and elastin, which are essential proteins for maintaining skin elasticity and firmness.
Enhanced Product Absorption
:
By removing the barrier of dead skin cells and fine hair, dermaplaning allows skincare products to penetrate more effectively into the deeper layers of the skin. This can enhance the efficacy of serums,
moisturisers
, and other topical treatments.
Improved Texture and Tone:
Dermaplaning helps to improve the overall texture and tone of the skin. It can reduce the appearance of rough patches, uneven pigmentation, and fine lines, resulting in a smoother and more even complexion.
Temporary Hair Removal:
While dermaplaning primarily focuses on exfoliation, it also provides the benefit of temporary hair removal. By shaving off fine vellus hair, it can create a smoother surface for makeup application and give the skin a smoother appearance.
Safe and Non-invasive:
When performed by a trained professional, dermaplaning is a safe and non-invasive procedure suitable for most skin types. It does not involve the use of harsh chemicals or intense heat, making it a gentle option for skin rejuvenation.
Overall, dermaplaning offers several skincare benefits, including exfoliation, stimulation of cell renewal, enhanced product absorption, improved texture and tone, and temporary hair removal, contributing to a smoother, brighter, and more youthful-looking complexion.
Debunking Dermaplaning Myths: What You Need to Know About It
Dermaplaning, a popular skincare treatment, is surrounded by various myths and misconceptions. Let's debunk some of the common myths and unveil the facts:
Myth
: Dermaplaning Causes Hair to Grow Back Thicker and Darker.
Fact:
Contrary to popular belief, dermaplaning does not alter the texture or colour of hair. The vellus hair, or "peach fuzz," removed during dermaplaning grows back at the same rate and texture as before.
Myth:
Dermaplaning Causes Skin to Become Thinner.
Fact
: Dermaplaning only targets the outermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum, and does not affect the deeper layers where collagen and elastin reside. When performed correctly, dermaplaning is safe and does not thin the skin.
Myth
: Dermaplaning Leads to Increased Breakouts.
Fact:
Dermaplaning is actually beneficial for acne-prone skin as it removes dead skin cells, excess oil, and debris that can clog pores and contribute to breakouts. However, proper hygiene and post-treatment care are essential to prevent bacterial growth and potential breakouts.
Myth:
Dermaplaning Is Painful.
Fact
: Dermaplaning is a gentle and non-invasive procedure that should not be painful when performed by a skilled professional. Clients may experience a mild scraping sensation, but it is generally well-tolerated and does not require numbing creams.
Myth:
Dermaplaning Is Not Safe for Sensitive Skin.
Fact:
Dermaplaning can be safely performed on most skin types, including sensitive skin, when done by a trained professional. However, individuals with active skin conditions, such as eczema or rosacea, should
consult with a dermatologist
before undergoing dermaplaning.
Myth:
Dermaplaning Is Only for Women.
Fact:
Dermaplaning is suitable for both men and women seeking smoother, brighter skin. It is a versatile treatment that addresses a variety of skincare concerns, regardless of gender.
Myth:
Dermaplaning Is Expensive and Time-Consuming.
Fact:
While dermaplaning is a professional treatment that may come with a cost, it is often more affordable than other cosmetic procedures. Additionally, dermaplaning sessions typically last between 30 to 45 minutes, making it a convenient option for busy individuals.
By dispelling these common myths, Clinikally aims to provide accurate information about dermaplaning, empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their skincare journey.

Effective Exfoliation

Dermaplaning removes dead skin cells and surface debris that can make the complexion appear dull. By eliminating this buildup, it unveils fresh, radiant skin underneath, thus instantly enhancing luminosity.
Stimulated Cell Renewal:
Dermaplaning stimulates the skin's natural renewal process by triggering cell turnover. This process encourages the production of new, healthy skin cells, leading to a brighter and more radiant complexion over time.

DIY Dermaplaning Tips: Navigating the Path to Facial Hair Removal
Embarking on DIY dermaplaning requires careful consideration and preparation to ensure a safe and effective treatment. Here are essential tips to guide you through the process:
Choose the Right Tool :
Opt for a dermaplaning tool specifically designed for home use. These tools often feature safety guards to help minimise the risk of cuts.
Start with Clean, Dry Skin
:
Ensure your face is thoroughly cleansed and completely dry before starting. Oil and moisture can cause the blade to slip, increasing the risk of nicks.
Use Proper Technique:

Focus on Small Sections:
Work in small sections, starting from the bottom of your face and moving upwards. This methodical approach helps ensure you don't miss any areas.
Be Gentle:
The key to successful DIY dermaplaning is a gentle touch. There's no need to apply excessive pressure; the blade should lightly skim the surface of your skin.
Aftercare is Crucial
:
Immediately after dermaplaning, apply a gentle, hydrating moisturiser to soothe the skin. Avoid using exfoliating products or those containing retinol and alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) for at least a week to prevent irritation.
Protect Your Skin
:
Your skin will be more sensitive to the sun post-dermaplaning, so apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher every day, even if you're staying indoors.
Clean Your Tool
:
After each use, thoroughly clean your dermaplaning tool with rubbing alcohol to disinfect it. This step is essential to prevent bacterial growth and potential skin infections.
Know When to Stop
:
If you experience any irritation, redness, or discomfort, it's important to stop immediately to avoid further damaging your skin.
Regular Maintenance :
For best results, incorporate dermaplaning into your skincare routine every three to four weeks. This frequency helps maintain the smooth texture and radiant appearance of your skin without over-exfoliating.
DIY dermaplaning can be a rewarding addition to your skincare regimen, offering a way to achieve smoother, brighter skin at home.
