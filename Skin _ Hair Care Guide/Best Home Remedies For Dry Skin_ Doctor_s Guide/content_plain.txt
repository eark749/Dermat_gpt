Dry skin can be a nuisance, especially in the winter. It can be annoying and uncomfortable to have dry skin, but don’t worry! In this blog, we will discover some of the best home remedies for dry skin in winter that are recommended by dermatologists to keep your skin moisturised, supple, and healthy looking throughout the winter season.
What causes dry skin?
Dry skin is a common condition that can be brought on by a variety of factors. Some of the most common causes of dry skin are listed below.
Ageing
: As we get
older
, our skin produces less oil and becomes more susceptible to dryness.
Seasonal changes
: The colder months can be harsh on your skin, depriving it of the moisture it needs to stay hydrated.
Weather
: In addition to seasonal changes, extreme temperatures like those experienced during
summer
and winter can dry out your skin.
Skin types
: Some people naturally have drier skin than others, while some may experience dry skin due to certain medications like antidepressants or blood pressure medications.
Lifestyle
: Smoking and drinking alcohol can cause your skin to become dehydrated, as well as other lifestyle factors like stress and lack of sleep.
Skin conditions
: Conditions such as
eczema
, psoriasis and
dermatitis
can cause your skin to become dry and flaky due to excessive scratching and rubbing.
Skincare products you use
: Many different products can have an impact on the health of your skin, including soaps, shampoos and moisturisers.
Environmental factors leading to dry skin
Dry skin can be caused by several environmental factors that interfere with the skin's natural moisture barrier. Some of these elements are:
Low Humidity
: Dry climates or indoor environments with low
humidity
levels, particularly in the winter, can cause moisture to evaporate from the skin, resulting in dryness and dehydration.
Excessive Heat
: Prolonged exposure to central heating, fireplaces, or other sources of high heat can deplete the skin's moisture, causing it to become dry and
flaky
.
Cold Weather
: Cold temperatures can reduce the skin's ability to retain moisture, resulting in dryness, chapping, and irritation.
Hot Baths or Showers
: Excessively hot showers or baths can strip the skin of its natural oils, disrupting its moisture balance and contributing to dryness.
Harsh Soaps and Cleansers
: Using harsh soaps, detergents, or cleansers with strong chemicals can strip away the skin's natural oils and disrupt its
protective barrier
, resulting in dry, irritated skin.
Frequent Handwashing
: Washing hands frequently, especially with harsh soaps or alcohol-based sanitisers, can cause dryness and irritation by removing natural oils from the skin.
Overexposure to the Sun
: Prolonged exposure to the sun's harmful
UV rays
without adequate protection can cause skin damage, resulting in moisture loss and dryness.
Wind
: Windy conditions can strip moisture from the skin's surface, contributing to dry and chapped skin, especially on exposed areas like the face and hands.
Chemical Irritants
: Chemicals found in household cleaning products, certain fabrics, and cosmetics can irritate the skin and disrupt its natural moisture balance, resulting in dryness and
sensitivity
.
Poor Hydration and Diet
: Not drinking enough water and eating a diet deficient in essential fatty acids and nutrients can contribute to dry skin by depriving the body of essential hydration and nutrients.
To reduce the effects of these environmental factors on the skin, it is critical to use gentle cleansers, moisturise regularly, avoid bathing in excessively hot water, protect the skin from harsh weather conditions, and stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Additionally, using sunscreen and eating a healthy diet rich in vitamins and essential fatty acids can help promote healthy, hydrated skin.
Role of diet and hydration in skin health
Diet and hydration are important factors in maintaining healthy skin. Nutrients obtained through diet and adequate hydration levels can have a direct impact on the appearance, texture, and overall health of the skin. They contribute in the following ways:
Hydration
: Adequate hydration is critical for skin health.
Water helps to keep the skin's moisture balance in check, preventing dryness and promoting a supple, radiant complexion. Dehydration can cause the skin to appear dull, dry, and flaky.
Drinking plenty of water
daily helps to keep the skin hydrated from within.
Nutrients for Skin Health
:
Vitamins
: Vitamins A, C, E, and K, as well as B-complex vitamins, are essential for skin health. They help to produce collagen, protect against oxidative stress, promote healing, and maintain skin elasticity.
Antioxidants
: Antioxidants such as beta-carotene, lycopene, and flavonoids, which are found in fruits, vegetables, and nuts, help protect the skin from
free radical damage
, which can contribute to premature ageing and skin damage.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
: Found in fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts, these healthy fats help maintain the skin's lipid barrier, improving hydration and reducing inflammation, resulting in smoother and more supple skin.
Minerals
: Minerals such as
zinc
, selenium, and copper help with a variety of skin functions, including collagen synthesis, UV protection, and skin integrity.
Role of Diet
:
Incorporating Colourful Fruits and Vegetables
: Colourful fruits and vegetables are high in vitamins,
antioxidants
, and phytonutrients, all of which promote skin health. Carrots, bell peppers, citrus fruits, berries, and leafy greens are especially healthy.
Good Fats
: Eating foods high in healthy fats, like
avocados
, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish, helps to nourish the skin from the inside out, enhancing its appearance and ability to retain moisture.
Proteins
: Consuming enough protein promotes the formation of collagen, which helps to repair and preserve the structure of the skin. Foods like fish, poultry, legumes, dairy products, and lean meats have an impact on skin health.
Reducing Processed Food and Sugar Intake
: Excessive consumption of processed foods and refined sugars can cause inflammation, which can worsen skin conditions like acne and premature ageing.
Moderate Alcohol and Caffeine Consumption
: Consuming too much alcohol or caffeine can cause the body to become dehydrated, which may have an impact on the moisture content of the skin. The secret to keeping your skin healthy is moderation.
Using the proper skincare techniques and maintaining a balanced diet rich in antioxidants, water, and nutrients can significantly improve the appearance of healthy, radiant skin.
Best home remedies for dry skin
To treat dry skin symptoms like flakes, itching, cracks, and even bleeding, it is best to consult a skincare specialist. At
Clinikally
, you have the
best dermatologist online consultation
with top dermatologists who give personalised treatment plans based on your skin type and condition.
The best way to treat dry skin is to moisturise it. You can do this by applying a moisturiser to your skin after showering or bathing. Moisturisers with
shea butter
, jojoba oil, or glycerine will work best for you to reduce skin dryness. If you don’t like the idea of applying lotion after every bath or shower and would rather skip the process altogether, try using a humidifier in your room at night instead. This will help keep moisture in the air so that when you go to bed at night and sleep with sweaty sheets wrapped around your body, there is still enough moisture present in the air around them to keep them from drying out too much during their time under those sheets.
#1 Oatmeal
Oatmeal is a natural exfoliant, thanks to its ability to gently remove dead skin cells. Most people eat oatmeal for breakfast, but it can also be used topically on your body or face. To use
oatmeal
as an exfoliant:
Add 1 cup of oats (uncooked) to 3 cups of water in a saucepan on low heat. Let the mixture simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon or spatula so that it doesn't burn.
When cooked through and thickened, remove from heat and transfer into a bowl so you can cool it down before application (see below).
Allow your oat flour/paste to cool completely before applying directly onto dry areas such as cracked heels or elbows for 5–10 minutes at night before bedtime during winter months when air conditioning is used inside most homes—this will help heal those areas quickly!
#2 Honey
Honey
is one of the best remedies for dry skin. It contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties that help to heal dry or damaged skin. It's also a natural moisturiser, so it helps to keep your skin hydrated and reduces signs of ageing due to prolonged exposure to the sun.
Honey can be used on its own as a treatment for dry skin, but it can also be mixed with other ingredients such as coconut oil or olive oil for added benefits.
Use honey as an acne treatment by mixing equal parts honey with turmeric powder (or oatmeal) and applying directly onto the affected area two times per day until you see results!
#3 Banana
Banana is a good source of potassium, which helps to reduce inflammation and heal the skin.
Apply a banana paste to the affected area. Banana also contains vitamin C, which is an antioxidant that helps to protect the skin from free radicals.
#4 Aloe vera
Aloe vera
is a plant that thrives in warm, dry climates and has long been used in traditional medicine. The gel inside the leaves can be used to moisturise your skin and help heal minor burns, cuts, or rashes. You can eat aloe vera as well—it contains many important vitamins and nutrients.
To use aloe vera as a home remedy for dry skin:
Wash your hands before handling the plant or its juice to avoid irritation.
Cut off a leaf with sharp scissors and set it on sterile cloth (or paper towels) to drain out any liquid remaining in the leaf’s centre cavity. Do not squeeze out this juice—you want to retain any beneficial enzymes present in it!
#5 Olive oil
Olive oil
is a natural moisturiser and can be used on skin, hair and nails. This multipurpose oil helps keep your skin healthy and glowing, giving it an overall youthful appearance. Olive oil can be used for the face as well as other parts of the body. It works well if you have dry skin because it helps retain moisture in the epidermis (the outermost layer of your skin).
It also makes for a great makeup remover since it's gentle on the eyes and won't irritate them like some harsher products might do. On top of that, olive oil is also an excellent shaving cream! Just apply some to wet legs or arms before shaving; rinse off after using soap or gel; pat dry instead of wiping away excess moisture with a towel so that no residue is left behind; then apply lotion or aloe vera aftershave balm if desired (but not both at once).
#6 Paraffin wax
Paraffin wax is a thick, white substance that's often used to make candles and soaps. It's also often used as a moisturiser for dry skin. You can purchase paraffin wax at many drug stores or beauty stores, but you can also make your own using just a few ingredients:
1 cup of petroleum jelly (Vaseline)
20 drops of lavender essential oil—use any other essential oil if you don't have access to lavender
To make this homemade paraffin bath, combine all of the ingredients in a bowl and mix well until they're completely blended. Pour the mixture into moulds and let them harden overnight before removing them from their moulds and storing them in an air-tight container in your fridge until you're ready to use them again! To use these home remedies for dry skin on yourself or someone else: simply heats up some water in a large pot; then add two tablespoons' worth of this homemade paraffin wax mixture per person (if making more than one person's worth at once). Stir everything well until it melts into liquid form; then pour it into moulds designed specifically for making DIY hand sanitiser or lip balm containers so that they resemble solidified ice cubes when frozen solid again overnight! Once frozen solid again after cooling down enough outside through immersion time inside then remove from mould(s) by pressing against sides gently before breaking apart gently with hands first followed by scissors if necessary -- once removed from mould(s), do not try eating since these are meant only as topical treatments rather than ingestible ones!
#7 Apple cider vinegar
Apple cider vinegar is an effective home remedy for dry skin because it's a natural astringent, which means it helps to reduce the appearance of pores and tighten skin. The acid in apple cider vinegar can also help to kill bacteria on your face that might cause acne and breakouts.
Apple cider vinegar is effective in reducing redness, inflammation, and blemishes.
#8 Glycerine with rose water or lemon juice
Glycerine is a
humectant
, which means that it attracts and binds moisture from the air. Applying glycerine to your skin will help to keep it hydrated. You can use either rose water or lemon juice in this remedy:
In a small container, mix 1/4 teaspoon of glycerine and 1/4 teaspoon of
rose water
. Add enough rosewater to make a paste that is thin enough to spread easily on your skin (the thicker the mixture is, the harder it will be for you to apply).
Make a similar mixture using lemon juice instead of rosewater.
#9 Coconut oil
Coconut oil
is a versatile and popular natural oil that has gained popularity due to its potential skin, hair, and overall health benefits. It is extracted from coconut kernels and contains several fatty acids, including lauric acid, caprylic acid, and capric acid, which contribute to its unique properties. Here are some examples of how coconut oil can be used:
Skin Moisturiser
: Coconut oil contains fatty acids that can help moisturise the skin. It forms a protective barrier on the skin's surface, reducing moisture loss and assisting in hydration maintenance. It is frequently used as a natural moisturiser for dry skin and can also be used as a gentle hydrating option on the body or face.
Anti-inflammatory Properties
: Some research suggests that when applied topically, coconut oil may have anti-inflammatory properties. This can help with conditions like eczema, psoriasis, and mild skin irritations.
Makeup Remover
: Coconut oil is sometimes used as a natural makeup remover due to its ability to dissolve makeup effectively. It can assist in the breakdown and removal of stubborn makeup while also hydrating the skin.
Hair Conditioner
: Coconut oil is well-known for its ability to penetrate hair strands, thereby moisturising and strengthening hair. It is frequently used as a hair treatment to smooth out frizz, add shine, and improve overall hair health.
Antibacterial and antifungal properties
: Lauric acid, a component of coconut oil, has been shown in some studies to have antibacterial and antifungal properties, which may be beneficial for certain skin conditions.
While many people find coconut oil beneficial to their skin and hair, it is important to note that it may not work for everyone. Due to its comedogenic nature, some people may experience clogged pores or skin irritation, particularly on the face. Before using it extensively, always do a patch test, especially if you have sensitive or acne-prone skin. Additionally, when choosing coconut oil, go for virgin or unrefined coconut oil, as these contain more beneficial compounds than refined versions. It is also important to incorporate coconut oil into your routine sparingly, as excessive use may not be suitable for all skin types. A dermatologist or skincare professional can provide personalised advice on how to use coconut oil for specific skin concerns.
#10 Avocado masks
Avocado masks are well-known for their hydrating and nourishing properties in homemade skincare treatments.
Avocado
, which is high in healthy fats, vitamins, and antioxidants, can benefit the skin when applied topically. To make an avocado mask, follow these steps:
Simple Avocado Mask:
Ingredients
: 12 avocados, ripe, 1 tbsp honey (optional, for extra moisture) and a few drops lemon juice (optional, for brightness)
Instructions
:
Scoop out the flesh of half an avocado and mash it in a bowl until it forms a smooth paste.
Add honey for extra moisture and a few drops of lemon juice for a brightening effect, if desired.
To make a consistent mask, thoroughly combine the ingredients.
Cleanse and pat dry your face before applying an even layer of the avocado mask.
Allow the mask to sit on your face for about 10-15 minutes.
Remove the mask with lukewarm water and pat your skin dry gently.
Benefits of an Avocado Mask
:
Hydration
: Avocado is high in healthy fats like omega-9 fatty acids, which can deeply moisturise the skin, making it ideal for people with dry skin.
Nourishment
: Avocado contains vitamins E and C, which have antioxidant properties. These vitamins can aid in the protection of the skin from free radicals and the maintenance of skin health.
Calming and Healing
: Avocado's natural oils are good for sensitive skin types because they can calm and heal irritated or inflammatory skin.
Brightening
: Adding lemon juice, which is high in vitamin C, may have a gradual but slight brightening effect on the skin, assisting in the evening out of skin tone.
Tips for Using Avocado Masks
:
Before using the mask, do a patch test to make sure you are not allergic to or sensitive to any of the ingredients.
To achieve a smoother consistency, use ripe avocados.
Depending on the needs of your skin, alter the mask by adding additional natural ingredients like yoghurt, oatmeal, aloe vera, or essential oils.
After washing off the mask, apply the mask to clean your skin and continue with your usual skincare regimen, adding moisturiser if necessary.
Avocado masks provide skin with hydration, nourishment, and a natural glow, making them a useful addition to any skincare regimen. However, stop using the product and see a dermatologist if you feel any uncomfortable side effects.
Best moisturisers for dry skin
Moisturising your skin is an essential part of keeping it healthy. The
best moisturisers
, creams and ointments work by trapping existing moisture in your skin. Unfortunately, many people with dry skin find that their skin can become too oily when they use moisturiser. The solution? Look for a product that's specifically made for dry areas of the body, such as hands and feet, rather than all over your body.
If you have particularly sore patches of skin on your hands or feet where cracking has occurred, apply some petroleum jelly (Vaseline) to them before going to bed at night. This will help soften the cracked areas during sleep and leave them feeling much better in the morning!
Natural ingredients in moisturisers for dry skin
Natural ingredients can offer hydration, nourishment, and soothing effects without using harsh chemicals in
moisturisers
for dry skin. The following list of natural components is typical for moisturisers meant for dry skin types:
Shea Butter
: The nuts of the shea tree are the source of this luxurious natural moisturiser. Its fatty acid and vitamin content deeply hydrates the skin and aids in repairing its natural barrier function.
Cocoa Butter
: Rich in fatty acids and extremely emollient,
cocoa butter
is extracted from cocoa beans. It creates a barrier to keep moisture in while softening and nourishing dry skin.
Aloe Vera
: Well-known for its calming effects, aloe vera gel hydrates skin without making it oily. It soothes and moisturises dry, irritated skin because it contains vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
Hyaluronic Acid
: A naturally occurring substance in the human body,
hyaluronic acid
is not directly found in nature. It works wonders at drawing in and holding onto moisture to keep skin hydrated and plump.
Oat Extract
: Compounds in oat extract have calming and anti-inflammatory effects. It helps moisturise sensitive skin and relieves itching and dryness.
Coconut Oil
: Coconut oil can help moisturise and hydrate dry skin due to its moisturising and antibacterial qualities. It might not be appropriate for everyone, though, as some people may experience pore clogging.
Jojoba Oil
:
Jojoba oil
is easily absorbed and helps control the production of sebum, much like the natural oils found on the skin. It hydrates for a long time without leaving you feeling oily.
Glycerin
:
Glycerin
is a humectant that helps to keep skin hydrated by attracting moisture from the air. It is frequently used in moisturisers due to its ability to increase skin moisture content.
Green Tea Extract
: Green tea extract, which is high in antioxidants, protects the skin from environmental damage while also providing hydration and soothing dryness.
Calendula Extract
: Calendula extract, known for its anti-inflammatory and skin-soothing properties, can soothe dry and irritated skin while also promoting healing and hydration.
Look for moisturisers for dry skin that combine these natural ingredients to provide deep hydration and skin-nourishing benefits. However, if you have sensitive skin or allergies to certain natural ingredients, you should conduct patch tests or consult a dermatologist to avoid potential adverse reactions.
Choosing the right moisturiser for your skin type
Choosing the right moisturiser for your skin type is critical to ensuring optimal hydration while avoiding problems such as
clogged pores
, excess oiliness, or dryness. Here are some recommendations for moisturisers based on skin type:
Normal Skin
:
Choose a non-greasy, lightweight moisturiser that provides balanced moisture without leaving your skin feeling heavy. Gel or water-based moisturisers are often beneficial to normal skin types. Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid or glycerin to provide effective hydration without adding extra oiliness.
Dry Skin
:
Choose a moisturiser that is thick and creamy and contains emollient components like shea butter, cocoa butter, or oils like jojoba oil or avocado oil. Look for "intensive" or "hydrating" moisturisers to deeply nourish and restore dry skin. Consider products containing ceramides or hyaluronic acid to improve moisture retention.
Oily Skin
:
Choose oil-free, non-comedogenic moisturisers that will not clog pores or worsen oiliness. Oily skin responds nicely to lightweight, gel-based, or oil-free treatments. Hydration can be delivered without the use of additional oil by substances like as hyaluronic acid or glycerin.
Combination Skin
:
Use a combination skin moisturiser that balances moisture for dry areas without making oily zones gritty. Consider using a thinner lotion for oily skin and a little heavier cream for dry skin. Combination skin types can benefit from gel or water-based moisturisers.
Sensitive Skin
:
To reduce the risk of irritation, look for fragrance-free and hypoallergenic moisturisers. For sensitive skin, look for products that have soothing ingredients like aloe vera, oat extract, or calendula. Avoid harsh chemicals and probable allergies, and conduct patch testing before experimenting with new products.
Mature Skin
:
Choose anti-aging moisturisers that contain chemicals like retinoids, peptides, or antioxidants like vitamin C or E. To address aging-related skin issues, look for moisturisers with increased moisture and collagen-boosting ingredients.
Remember to patch-test new products, especially if you have sensitive skin, to rule out any negative reactions. When selecting a moisturiser for your skin type, you should also consider aspects such as the climate, season, and any unique skin conditions you may have. If you're unsure, a dermatologist can help you find the finest moisturiser for your individual skin needs.
Get rid of dry skin like a pro!
There are plenty of home remedies to prevent dry skin that you can try at home. If you're experiencing dry skin, it's important to keep a good skincare routine. This includes using a moisturiser regularly and applying it twice daily. You should also avoid harsh soaps and detergents that may dry out your skin further, as well as smoking and alcohol (which can cause dehydration). Another tip is to avoid hot water when showering or bathing, as this will strip away natural oils from your skin, leaving it even drier than before!
After washing up in the morning, apply some moisturiser to damp skin before drying off with a soft towel. In addition to keeping your hands soft throughout the day, applying lotion to damp hands allows the product's nutrients to penetrate deeper into the layers of your epidermis, so doing this simple step each morning before leaving home will ensure they stay hydrated throughout the day too.
Daily skincare routine for dry skin
A daily skincare routine for dry skin should include gentle cleansing, hydrating, and moisturising to keep skin moisturised and prevent further dryness. Here's an example of a skincare routine:
Morning Routine
:
Cleansing
:
Use a gentle, hydrating cleanser designed for dry skin to cleanse your face. Avoid using harsh or drying cleansers that remove natural oils.
Toning (Optional)
: To balance the pH levels of the skin and prepare it for subsequent skincare products, use an alcohol-free, hydrating toner. This step is optional for those with dry skin.
Serum
:
To boost moisture levels and protect against environmental damage, use a hydrating serum containing ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, or vitamin C.
Moisturizing
:
Apply a rich, emollient moisturiser designed for dry skin. Look for shea butter, ceramides, and oils like jojoba, avocado, or almond oil. Apply liberally to seal in moisture.
Sun Protection
:
Even on cloudy days, apply sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to protect your skin from harmful UV rays. Choose a sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB rays.
Evening Routine
:
Cleansing
: Cleanse your face with the same gentle cleanser you used in the morning to remove dirt, makeup, and impurities that have accumulated throughout the day.
Exfoliation (1-2 times a week)
:
To remove dead skin cells and promote skin renewal, use a mild exfoliant designed for dry skin. Excessive exfoliation can exacerbate dryness.
Toning (Optional)
:
After cleansing, use a gentle toner with hydrating or soothing ingredients to replenish moisture.
Serum:
Use a nighttime serum to address specific issues like dryness, fine lines, or hyperpigmentation. Ingredients such as retinoids and peptides can help mature or ageing dry skin.
Moisturizing
:
While sleeping, apply a nourishing and thicker night cream or moisturiser that deeply hydrates and repairs the skin. Look for hyaluronic acid, antioxidants, and peptides among the ingredients.
Eye Cream (Optional)
:
Apply a hydrating eye cream as needed to relieve under-eye dryness and reduce the appearance of fine lines and dark circles.
Additional Tips
:
Keep Your Skin Hydrated
: To keep your skin hydrated from the inside out, drink lots of water throughout the day.
Humidifier
: To add moisture to the air and stop skin dehydration, think about installing a humidifier at home, particularly during the dry seasons.
Patch test
: To make sure new products suit your skin type without aggravating dryness or causing irritation, introduce them gradually and conduct patch tests.
If you have persistent skin concerns or severe dryness, consult a dermatologist. Customise this routine to your skin's unique needs and preferences.
Preventative measures against dry skin
Preventative measures can help reduce dry skin and keep skin hydrated. Here are some ways to avoid dry skin:
Use Gentle Cleansers
: Avoid using harsh soaps or cleansers that strip away natural oils. To avoid further drying out your skin, choose mild, fragrance-free cleansers formulated for dry or sensitive skin.
Shorter, Lukewarm Showers
: Long, hot showers can dehydrate the skin. Showers should be kept to 5-10 minutes with lukewarm water to avoid excessive moisture loss.
Pat Dry and Moisturise Right Away
: After taking a shower or bath, pat your skin dry with a towel and moisturise while it is still a little bit damp. This aids in retaining moisture.
Moisturiser Selection
: Choose a rich, emollient moisturiser formulated for dry skin. Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, shea butter, ceramides, or oils such as jojoba, almond, or avocado oil for intense hydration.
Stay Hydrated
: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your body and skin hydrated.
Humidify Indoor Air
: Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air and prevent excessive skin dryness, especially during dry seasons or in heated indoor environments.
Protect Skin from Harsh Weather
: Use scarves, gloves, and protective clothing to protect your skin from the elements. When you are outside in the sun, use moisturisers with an added SPF.
Avoid Irritants
: Limit your exposure to harsh chemicals, strong detergents, and products that may irritate your skin. When working with cleaning products or chemicals, use gloves.
Apply Sunscreen Daily
: Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 to protect your skin from harmful UV rays, which can cause dryness and premature ageing.
Healthy Diet
: To support overall skin health, eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, and omega-3 fatty acids.
Prevent Over-Exfoliation
: Over-exfoliation can cause dryness by removing the skin's natural oils. Use a mild exfoliant that is appropriate for your skin type and limit your weekly exfoliation to once or twice.
See a Dermatologist
: For individualised advice and treatments, consult a dermatologist or skincare specialist if you have severe or persistently dry skin despite taking preventive measures.
By incorporating these preventative measures into your daily routine, you can help reduce dryness and maintain healthy, hydrated skin. If you have persistent dry skin issues, tailor these practises to your skin's specific needs and consult a healthcare professional.
