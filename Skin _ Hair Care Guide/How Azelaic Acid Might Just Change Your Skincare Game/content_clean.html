These are substances in your body that can cause skin inflammation and acne. Azelaic acid can reduce inflammation by neutralizing free radicals.</span></p>
<p><span>Acne is caused in part by abnormally shed skin cells. <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/how-to-cure-pimples-at-home">Pimples </a>are caused by the accumulation of dead cells.

<p><span>If you have acne-prone skin and are looking to incorporate azelaic acid into your skincare routine, here are some tips to keep in mind:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Start with a lower concentration</b><span>: As with any new skincare ingredient, it is important to start with a lower concentration of azelaic acid and gradually work your way up to higher concentrations. This can help to minimize any potential irritation or sensitivity.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use it consistently</b><span>: For best results, it is important to use azelaic acid consistently as part of your daily skincare routine. This can help to prevent breakouts and improve the overall appearance of your skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Apply it after cleansing</b><span>: To ensure that the azelaic acid is able to penetrate the skin effectively, it is best to apply it after cleansing your skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use a moisturizer</b><span>: Azelaic acid can sometimes cause dryness or flakiness, so it is important to use a moisturizer after applying it to help keep the skin hydrated.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid using other exfoliating products</b><span>: Azelaic acid has exfoliating properties of its own, so it is best to avoid using other exfoliating products such as scrubs or chemical peels while using it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consider using it in combination with other acne-fighting ingredients</b><span>: Azelaic acid can be effective on its own, but it may be even more effective when used in combination with other acne-fighting ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>As always, it is best to consult with a dermatologist before incorporating any new skincare products into your routine, especially if you have sensitive skin or are using other acne treatments.</span></p>
