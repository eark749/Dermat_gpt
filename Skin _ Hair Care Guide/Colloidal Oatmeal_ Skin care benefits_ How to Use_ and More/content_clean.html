<p><span>Colloidal oatmeal is a type of oatmeal that has been finely ground and suspended in a liquid. It is often found in skincare products due to its capacity to calm and hydrate the skin. In this blog, we will learn more about the benefits of colloidal oatmeal and how to use it in your skincare routine to achieve smoother and nourished skin.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is Colloidal Oatmeal?</b></h2>
<div><img alt="What is Colloidal Oatmeal?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/What_is_Colloidal_Oatmeal_480x480.jpg?v=1712659961"/></div>
<p><span>Colloidal oatmeal has been used for centuries as a salve for itchy, dry, and irritated skin. This natural ingredient is readily available in </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hydrasoothe-moisturiser">moisturizers</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/shampoos">shampoos</a><span>, and shaving creams. Oat grain, or Avena sativa, is ground into a fine powder to make colloidal oatmeal. Emollients soften or soothe the skin because they contain fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that are beneficial. Colloidal oatmeal was officially classified as a skin protectant by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2003. It also benefits your skin by having anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</span></p>
<p><span>Antioxidants combat free radicals, which, if their levels rise too high, can cause oxidative stress and harm to your body. Oxidative stress is associated with diseases like </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/atopic-dermatitis">dermatitis</a><span>, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and inflammation. It has an impact on </span>ageing<span> as well because it can lead to </span>dry<span>, brittle skin. According to one study, the unique chemical makeup of colloidal oatmeal lowers cytokines, a group of proteins that cause inflammation in your body. The avenanthramides, a class of plant chemicals found in oat kernels, are responsible for these beneficial properties. Avenathramides reduce inflammation by preventing inflammatory cytokines. As a result, avenathramides are responsible for both the heart-healthy qualities of eating oatmeal and the benefits of colloidal oatmeal for the skin.</span></p>

<p><b>Gentle Exfoliation</b><span>: Colloidal oatmeal has gentle exfoliating properties that can help remove dead skin cells and promote cell turnover, revealing smoother, more radiant skin beneath. This gentle <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/exfoliation%20">exfoliation</a> can help to improve the texture and tone of ageing skin, making it appear less dull and rough.</span></p>

<p><b>Reduced Inflammation</b><span>: Chronic inflammation is thought to play a role in the ageing process by causing the breakdown of <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/collagen">collagen</a> and elastin fibres in the skin. Colloidal oatmeal reduces inflammation and protects against oxidative damage, slowing the ageing process and maintaining the skin's youthful appearance.</span></p>

<p><span>Colloidal oatmeal is an important ingredient in sun care products because of its soothing, hydrating, and protective properties, making it an ideal addition to formulations that protect the skin from sun damage. Here's how colloidal oatmeal helps with sun care:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Colloidal oatmeal is known for its ability to soothe and calm irritated skin, making it especially useful for treating sunburn. Its anti-inflammatory properties help to reduce the redness and discomfort of sunburn, providing immediate relief while also promoting healing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Sun exposure can cause the skin to become dry and dehydrated. Colloidal oatmeal acts as a humectant, attracting moisture to the skin and forming a protective barrier to keep it in. This helps to prevent moisture loss and keeps the skin hydrated, which reduces the drying effects of sun exposure.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Prolonged sun exposure can cause inflammation in the skin, resulting in redness, swelling, and discomfort. Colloidal oatmeal contains anti-inflammatory properties that help to reduce inflammation and soothe sun-exposed skin, relieving sunburn and other inflammatory symptoms.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Sun exposure can weaken the skin's natural barrier function, increasing sensitivity and susceptibility to damage. Colloidal oatmeal strengthens the skin barrier by replenishing lipids and proteins, thereby restoring its integrity and resilience. This protects the skin from further damage and promotes healing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Colloidal oatmeal contains <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/antioxidants">antioxidants</a> like vitamin E, ferulic acid, and avenanthramides, which help neutralise free radicals caused by UV radiation. This antioxidant protection helps to prevent oxidative damage to the skin, which lowers the risk of premature ageing and skin cancer caused by sun exposure.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-sunprotect-sunscreen-spf-50">Sunscreens</a> and other sun-care products can occasionally cause skin irritation or sensitivity, particularly in people with sensitive or reactive skin. Colloidal oatmeal soothes and calms irritated skin, lowering the risk of adverse reactions to sunscreen and increasing its tolerability.</span></p>
