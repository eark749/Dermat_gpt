<p><span>The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland found in the lower front of the neck. The thyroid gland produces thyroid hormones, which the body utilizes to generate energy, stay warm, and keep the organs and muscles functioning properly. The most frequent thyroid issues are caused by an improper synthesis of thyroid hormones. Hypothyroidism, often known as underactive thyroid, is characterized by inadequate thyroid hormone levels. Hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid, occurs when the thyroid gland generates an excessive amount of hormone. Some people may lose their hair if their thyroid gland is hyperactive or underactive. Typically, autoimmune disorders are the leading cause of aberrant thyroid hormone levels. For example, Hashimoto's thyroiditis frequently causes hypothyroidism, but Graves' illness is frequently responsible for hyperthyroidism. In this blog, we look at the relationship between thyroid function and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-fall-hair-loss">hair loss</a>. We also discuss various treatments and home cures for thyroid-related hair loss.</span></p>
<h2><b>Understanding Thyroid and Hair Loss</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Understanding Thyroid and Hair Loss" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Understanding_Thyroid_and_Hair_Loss_480x480.jpg?v=1723014518"/></div>
<p><span>Hair loss may result from severe thyroid conditions that are left untreated. It is important to comprehend <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hair-regrow-serum%20">hair growth</a> to comprehend how these conditions contribute to hair loss.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Hair grows from the root in the bottom of the hair follicle on your scalp.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Your scalp's blood vessels nourish the root, which produces more cells and grows your hair.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Hair pushes up and out through your skin. It passes through oil glands, which help it stay soft and shiny.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Hair grows for a while, then falls out as the new regrowth cycle begins.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>When hormone production is interrupted, particularly hormones T3 and T4Trusted Source, other bodily systems are affected. This involves the growth of hair at the roots. Hair falls out and may not be replaced by new growth, causing thinning on the scalp and in other regions such as the brows. For example, alopecia is an autoimmune illness that is frequently associated with thyroid disorders. It promotes hair loss in more discrete places, eventually leading to <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/bald-patches">baldness</a>. Other autoimmune illnesses that can cause hair loss and are frequently associated with thyroid problems include polycystic ovarian syndrome and lupus erythematosus.</span></p>
<h3><b>What is Thyroid Hair Loss?</b></h3>
<div><img alt="What is Thyroid Hair Loss?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/What_is_Thyroid_Hair_Loss_480x480.jpg?v=1723014518"/></div>
<p><span>Thyroid hair loss is a symptom of severe or long-term hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, which can develop when the thyroid gland produces too much or too little hormones. This type of hair loss can affect the entire scalp, leaving hair sparse, as well as body hair, brows, and eyelashes.</span></p>
<h3><b>How Thyroid Imbalance Affects Hair Growth</b></h3>
<p><span>Some types of hair loss are permanent and others are temporary. The most common causes of hair loss are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Androgenic alopecia is a type of hereditary baldness that can affect anyone (male or female).</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss on the scalp and body.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Telogen effluvium is a type of hair loss characterized by rapid hair shedding over a short period. It usually occurs a few months after your body experiences physical or emotional stress. It may also be caused by sudden hormonal changes.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Anagen effluvium is a condition characterized by rapid hair loss caused by certain medical treatments, such as chemotherapy.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Types of Thyroid Disorders Linked to Hair Loss</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Types of Thyroid Disorders Linked to Hair Loss" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Types_of_Thyroid_Disorders_Linked_to_Hair_Loss_480x480.jpg?v=1723014518"/></div>
<p><span>Thyroid issues can result in hair loss, thinning, and even baldness. This can occur when the thyroid gland in the throat does not produce enough hormones (hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid) or produces too much (hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid).</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Hypothyroidism</b><span>: Hair follicles may become less active, resulting in thinning and loss of hair. Hair may also become dry and brittle, breaking or falling out.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hyperthyroidism</b><span>: The hair growth cycle may speed up, causing hair to become thin and brittle. </span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Other thyroid disorders, such as Hashimoto's and Graves' disease, can cause hair loss, albeit less frequently.  Antithyroid medications, such as methimazole (Tapazole), used to treat an overactive thyroid, can cause hair loss. </span></p>

<p><span>Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are both thyroid conditions, but their causes and symptoms differ.</span></p>
<p><b>Hypothyroidism</b></p>
<p><span>This condition, also known as underactive thyroid, occurs when the thyroid gland fails to produce adequate thyroid hormone levels. The symptoms include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Increased body weight</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Constipation</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Slower heart rate</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Dry skin and hair</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Cold sensitivity</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Fatigue</span></p>
</li>
<li><span>Enlarged thyroid, also known as a goiter</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Hyperthyroidism</b></p>
<p><span>This condition, also known as hyperthyroidism, occurs when the thyroid gland produces an excessive amount of thyroid hormone. The symptoms include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Weight loss</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Nervousness</span></p>
</li>

<h3><b>When to Seek Medical Advice</b></h3>
<div><img alt="When to Seek Medical Advice" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/When_to_Seek_Medical_Advice_480x480.jpg?v=1723014517"/></div>
<p><span>If you are concerned about hair loss and suspect it is caused by a thyroid imbalance, consult your primary care physician. Your doctor or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">dermatologists</a> can help you determine the reason for your hair loss and devise a treatment strategy.</span></p>
<h2><b>Diagnosis and Testing for Thyroid Hair Loss</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Diagnosis and Testing for Thyroid Hair Loss" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Diagnosis_and_Testing_for_Thyroid_Hair_Loss_480x480.jpg?v=1723014517"/></div>
<p><span>In our experience, the most useful thyroid function tests are TSH and T4, combined with a comprehensive clinical evaluation. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can cause hair loss, but hypothyroidism is significantly more frequent.</span></p>
<h3><b>Thyroid Function Tests</b></h3>
<p><span>While the relationship between thyroid disease and hair loss is unclear, some research suggests that thyroid dysfunction may cause the body to release hormones that kill hair follicles. A blood test to determine thyroid hormone levels is the gold standard for diagnosing thyroid-related hair loss. Your doctor may also do a physical examination and discuss your medical history.   The following thyroid function tests may be useful in diagnosing hair loss:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>TSH: Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are closely related to thyroid function; abnormally high or low levels may confirm or rule out a diagnosis of thyroid disease.</span></p>
</li>
<li><span>T4: This test is considered useful for assessing thyroid function. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Importance of Early Diagnosis</b></h3>
<p><span>Early detection and treatment of hair loss can help stop or decrease hair loss and even restore hair. The longer hair follicles remain dormant, the less likely they will become active again. Treatments may include dietary or hair care adjustments, as well as medical treatments that can be taken orally or administered topically.</span></p>
<h3><b>Consulting with a Specialist</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Consulting with a Specialist" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Consulting_with_a_Specialist_480x480.jpg?v=1723014518"/></div>
<p><span>They diagnose and treat hair and scalp illnesses and diseases that can result in hair loss, scalp <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/psoriasis">psoriasis</a>, itchy scalp, flaky scalp, alopecia, and a variety of other scalp problems.</span></p>
<h2><b>Treatments for Thyroid Hair Loss</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Treatments for Thyroid Hair Loss" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Treatments_for_Thyroid_Hair_Loss_480x480.jpg?v=1723014518"/></div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Treating the underlying cause</b><span>: The most important phase in preventing and correcting hair damage is to work closely with your doctor to manage your thyroid disorder. The doctor will prescribe thyroid supplements, such as levothyroxine, for hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. The doctor may also urge that you check your thyroid profile regularly. Within a few months of normalizing your thyroid levels, you should notice normal hair growth.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Monitor iron and nutrient status</b><span>: Abnormal thyroid function frequently impairs iron intake and absorption. Micronutrients like zinc, selenium, biotin, lysine, and vitamin B12 are frequently involved in fostering healthy hair development. It is consequently important to replace these vital nutrients in the body. Your doctor will order the required tests to explore these issues. Based on the results of these tests, you can then take nutritional supplements to help expedite hair regeneration.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Regulate your stress</b><span>: High levels of stress also produce changes in the levels of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol is not only related to incorrect thyroid levels, but it also inhibits natural hair growth.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Eat a balanced diet</b><span>: To properly recover from the body's disrupted metabolism, eat nutrient-rich and entire meals and maintain a balanced diet. Avoid junk food and processed foods, and instead incorporate fresh fruits, green leafy vegetables, and enough protein and calcium sources into your daily diet.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid hair treatments or abuse</b><span>: Using hair straighteners, curlers, or other heat alternatives to treat or style your hair at this point might permanently harm the hair cuticles. It can also have a long-term impact on hair quality. As a result, you must avoid these style tools, as well as harsh hair treatments and chemicals, which can exacerbate your hair loss and slow its recovery. Treat your hair gently, especially when washing and grooming it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Take only those hair supplements that are prescribed by the doctor</b><span>: The internet is frequently flooded with advice, advocating specific supplements for hair loss and promising immediate results in terms of hair growth. Some of them can not only interfere with the absorption of your drugs, but they can also have potentially harmful adverse effects on the body.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Maintain a healthy lifestyle</b><span>: One of the most important components of reversing hair loss is maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle. Exercising consistently and being active not only raises self-confidence and acceptance of one's condition, but it also improves blood circulation to numerous parts of the body, such as the scalp. This encourages the growth of healthy hair.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Practicing meditation and yoga</b><span>: Regular meditation and yoga practice can not only restore thyroid function but also reduce stress levels in the body. This promotes general health and helps to restore your hair to its previous brilliance.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Medical Treatments and Medications</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Medical Treatments and Medications" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Medical_Treatments_and_Medications_480x480.jpg?v=1723014518"/></div>
<p><span>Antithyroid medications (carbimazole and propylthiouracil) can occasionally cause generalized hair loss. It may be difficult to determine if hair loss is caused by previous thyroid overactivity or anti-thyroid medicines. In all likelihood, antithyroid medications are not the cause, and it is unusual to require alternate treatment for hyperthyroidism. Radioiodine does not result in hair loss.</span></p>
<p><span>The majority of hair loss treatments are designed to address androgenic alopecia (male and female pattern hair loss). These treatments include the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Medication</b><span>: Over-the-counter medications applied to the scalp (such as minoxidil or Rogaine®) are typically the first line of treatment for thinning hair.  Finasteride, also known as Propecia®, is a prescription oral medication approved only for men who have male pattern baldness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hair transplant</b><span>: In a hair transplant, hair strands from the thickest area of your scalp are carefully removed by your provider.  The strands are then transplanted by the provider, who embeds them in the area of your scalp where your hair is the thinnest.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Platelet-rich plasma (PRP)</b><span>: The plasma is extracted by your healthcare provider after your blood is drawn. This platelet-rich plasma is then injected into your scalp by them. PRP therapy helps promote the growth of new hair and slow down hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Natural Remedies and Lifestyle Changes</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Natural Remedies and Lifestyle Changes" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Natural_Remedies_and_Lifestyle_Changes_480x480.jpg?v=1723014518"/></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Treat nutritional deficiencies</b><span>:</span> <span>Even if you do not have a thyroid condition, nutritional deficiencies can cause hair loss. Researchers explain that the following nutrients may play a role in hair retention and loss: vitamins B-7 (biotin) and B complex, zinc, copper, iron, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-vitamin-c3-serum">vitamin C</a>, E, and A, coenzyme Q10, and iron. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Eat well</b><span>: A whole-foods-based diet is essential for good health. If you eat calcium-rich foods while being treated for hypothyroidism, try timing them at least four hours after your levothyroxine dose for optimal absorption. Processed foods, such as sugar, red meat, and fried foods, can trigger an inflammatory response. Caffeine and alcohol are also potential contributors. Inflammation can worsen thyroid symptoms, including hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Add anti-inflammatory foods</b><span>: Ginger and turmeric are anti-inflammatory foods that may help with hormonal function. The endocrine system includes your thyroid, so treating thyroid disorders may benefit from supporting it. Consider adding fresh ginger or turmeric root to your food. Their flavor is excellent in stir-fries and smoothies alike. Talk with your doctor about supplementation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consider herbs</b><span>: Some disciplines of alternative medicine utilize specific plants to cure hair loss caused by diseases like alopecia. Palmetto, black cohosh, dong quai, false unicorn, chasteberry, and red clover are examples of orally consumed herbs. Before attempting herbal remedies on your own, consult with your doctor, especially since none of these herbs are licensed for treating hair loss and no research has been undertaken to confirm they work.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Essential oils</b><span>: In many studies in this area, researchers have discovered that eucalyptus oil and other plant extracts may reduce hair fallout and improve hair density. Other <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-oil">hair oils</a> to try include </span><i><span>Arnica montana</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Cedrus atlantica</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Lavandula agustifolia</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Oscimum sanctum</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Pilocarpus jabarondi</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Rosmarinus officinalis,</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Thyme vulgaris</span></i><span>.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Iodine intake</b><span>: People with autoimmune thyroid disease should reduce their iodine intake. Iodine is used by the body to make thyroid hormones, thus too much might cause problems. Kelp and other seaweeds contain high levels of iodine, which can worsen symptoms such as hair loss. Certain multivitamins and cough syrups may include iodine, so read the label carefully.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Treat your hair gently</b><span>: By caring for your hair, you may be able to slow down hair loss. Avoid pulling your hair into tight braids, buns, or ponytails. Avoid twisting or pulling your hair. When freeing knots, use a wide-toothed comb rather than harsher brushes. Changing up your regimen may also help you avoid pulling out your hair before it naturally falls out.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
