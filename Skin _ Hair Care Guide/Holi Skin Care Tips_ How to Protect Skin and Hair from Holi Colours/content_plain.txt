Protective Measures During Holi
Holi, the festival of colours, is a joyous occasion marked by brightly coloured powders, water balloons, and water guns. While it is a fun-filled festival, you should take certain precautions to ensure your safety and well-being. Here are some tips to stay safe during Holi:
Apply a generous layer of moisturiser or sunscreen to your skin before going outside to play Holi. This creates a barrier between your skin and the coloured powders, making them easier to remove later and lowering the risk of irritation or allergic reactions.

Use sunglasses or protective eyewear to protect your eyes from coloured powders and water. Avoid wearing contact lenses because they can trap irritants and cause discomfort when in contact with coloured water or powders.
Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated, especially if you are spending time outside in the sunshine. Dehydration can happen quickly, especially during physical activities like playing Holi, so drink water regularly.
Use natural, organic colours derived from plant extracts or food-grade ingredients instead of synthetic colours, which may contain hazardous chemicals. Check the labels of colour packets to ensure they are safe to use on the skin and will not cause any negative reactions.
To protect your electronic devices from water damage, keep them in waterproof pouches or sealed plastic bags. Examples include smartphones and cameras. Avoid carrying valuables while playing Holi because they may get wet or damaged.
When applying colours or participating in water fights, respect others' boundaries and obtain their consent. Some people may prefer not to participate in Holi celebrations, so always seek permission before applying colours or throwing water at them.
When playing with water, exercise caution, especially if it is cold or mixed with ice. Avoid getting water in your ears, nose, or mouth because it increases the risk of infection. Dry off thoroughly after playing in the water to prevent chills.
If you are celebrating Holi during the COVID-19 pandemic, follow local health guidelines and recommendations to avoid spreading the virus. Maintain physical distance, wear masks in crowded places, and avoid large gatherings whenever possible.
By taking these precautions, you can enjoy the Holi festivities in a safe and responsible manner, ensuring a memorable and enjoyable celebration for all involved.

Oil Your Hair
: Before going to play Holi, apply a generous amount of oil to your hair and scalp, such as coconut oil or olive oil. Oil forms a protective barrier that repels coloured powders and makes them easier to wash away later. Massage the oil into your scalp and strands to ensure complete coverage.
Tie Your Hair

Wear a Hat or Scarf
: To protect your hair from direct sunlight and coloured powders, cover it with a hat, scarf, or bandana. This adds an extra layer of protection and keeps your hair clean and free of colour stains.
Avoid Washing Your Hair Right After Holi
: Wet hair is more prone to damage and breakage. Instead, wait until the coloured powders have completely dried before gently shaking them out of your hair.
Use a Mild Shampoo
: After Holi, wash your hair with a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo to remove the coloured powders without stripping your hair of natural oils. Massage the shampoo into your scalp and hair, paying special attention to areas with the most colour.
Condition Your Hair
: After washing, use a moisturising conditioner to hydrate and nourish it. Allow the conditioner to sit for a few minutes before thoroughly rinsing it out with lukewarm water to restore moisture and softness to your hair.
Avoid Heat Styling
: After playing Holi, use heat styling tools such as blow dryers, flat irons, and curling irons sparingly, as they can dry out and damage your hair. Instead, let your hair air dry naturally or use your blow dryer's cool setting.
Deep Condition Regularly
: Once or twice a week, apply a deep conditioning treatment or hair mask to replenish moisture and repair any damage caused by Holi's coloured powders and harsh environmental conditions.
Following these hair care tips will protect your hair from damage while keeping it healthy and beautiful during the festival of colours.
Preparing Your Hair for Holi
Preparing your hair for Holi is essential to reducing damage and making it easier to remove coloured powders later. Here are some steps to get your hair ready for the festival:
A few hours before playing Holi, generously apply oil to your hair and scalp. Coconut oil, olive oil, almond oil, or any other hair oil may be used. The oil forms a protective barrier, repelling coloured powders and preventing them from sticking to your hair. Massage the oil into the scalp and hair strands thoroughly.
Tie your hair in a bun, braid, ponytail, or any other style that keeps it contained and prevents it from becoming tangled or matted with coloured powders. This also reduces your hair's direct exposure to coloured powders.
Wear a scarf, bandana, hat, or cap to cover your hair and add another layer of protection against coloured powder. Select a covering that you do not mind getting stained with colours.
Before going out to play Holi, use a leave-in conditioner or hair serum to protect your hair. This helps to seal the cuticles and keep your hair hydrated, making it easier to wash the colours off later.
If you have long hair, braid or twist it into protective hairstyles to keep it contained and reduce exposure to coloured powders. This can also help keep your hair from becoming tangled or damaged during the festivities.
If you have split ends or damaged hair, consider getting it trimmed before Holi to remove any weakened or fragile ends. This prevents further damage and keeps your hair healthy and strong.
Before Holi, avoid using heat-styling tools such as blow dryers, flat irons, and curling irons because they can weaken your hair and make it more vulnerable to damage from coloured powders and environmental factors.
Drink plenty of water in the days before Holi to keep your hair hydrated from the inside out. Proper hydration promotes the health and elasticity of your hair, making it more resistant to damage.

Identifying Natural vs. Chemical Colours
Identifying natural colours from chemical colours can sometimes be difficult, but there are several indicators you can look for to differentiate between the two:
Ingredients
: A list of ingredients can be found on the colours powder's packaging. Natural colours typically contain plant-based ingredients like turmeric, beetroot, indigo, or flower extracts.
colour Appearance
: Natural colours have more muted or earthy tones than chemical colours, which are often bright and intense. Chemical colours may have a more artificial or neon appearance.
Texture
: The presence of plant-based particles or extracts can make natural colours appear coarser or grainier. Chemical colours may have a finer and smoother texture because they are frequently made with synthetic pigments and additives.
Scent
: Natural colours may emit a faint or subtle scent resembling the plant-based ingredients used. Chemical colours may have a stronger, more chemical-like odour as a result of the presence of synthetic additives.
Staining Properties
: Natural colours are less likely to stain skin or clothing than synthetic colours. Chemical colours can leave more intense stains that are difficult to remove, especially from fabrics and porous surfaces.
Certifications
: Look for certifications or labels indicating that the colour powder is natural, organic, or free of synthetic additives. Organic certifications from reputable organisations can verify that the colours are derived from natural sources and do not contain harmful chemicals.
Water Solubility
: Natural colours are often water soluble and can be easily removed with water and mild soap. Chemical colours may be less water-soluble and more difficult to remove, especially from the skin and hair.
Regulatory Approval
: Check to see if the colours powder has been approved or certified by regulatory authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or equivalent agencies in your country. Approved natural colours are generally thought to be safer for skin application than unregulated chemical colours.
By considering these factors and looking for signs of natural ingredients and formulations, you can better distinguish between natural and chemical colours and make informed choices when selecting colour powders for Holi celebrations.
DIY Natural Colours for a Safe Holi
Creating DIY natural colours for Holi is a fun and eco-friendly way to celebrate the festival while protecting your skin and the environment. Here are some easy recipes for creating natural colours at home with common ingredients:
