<p>You probably already know how important hydration is for keeping your skin looking and feeling healthy and radiant. However, you may be unaware that moisturising your skin twice a day is insufficient. A solid skincare routine that hydrates your skin necessitates some manoeuvring and, at times, product hacking.</p>
<p>Hydrating your skin is essential for maintaining its health and appearance. When your skin is properly hydrated, it appears plumper, smoother, and more youthful. Here are some tips for hydrating your skin for plumper and healthier skin:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Drink plenty of water</strong>: Staying hydrated from within is the first and most important step in hydrating your skin. Drinking plenty of water can help keep your skin moisturized and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use a gentle cleanser</strong>: Avoid harsh cleansers that can strip your skin of its natural oils. Opt for a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-foaming-face-wash">gentle cleanser</a> that is free of sulfates, fragrances, and other irritants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply a hydrating serum</strong>: Serums are highly concentrated formulations that can penetrate deeply into the skin and provide intense hydration. Look for a serum that contains <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hyaluronic-skinbooster-serum">hyaluronic acid</a>, which is a powerful humectant that can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use a moisturizer</strong>: Apply a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hydrasoothe-moisturiser">moisturizer</a> after your serum to lock in hydration and prevent moisture loss. Look for a moisturizer that contains ingredients like <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/ceramide-creams">ceramides</a>, glycerin, or shea butter, which can help to strengthen the skin's barrier and prevent dehydration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider a humidifier</strong>: If you live in a dry climate or spend a lot of time in air-conditioned or heated environments, a humidifier can help to add moisture to the air and keep your skin hydrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protect your skin from the sun</strong>: UV rays can damage your skin and contribute to dehydration. Always wear a broad-spectrum <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-sunprotect-sunscreen-spf-50">sunscreen</a> with an SPF of at least 30 and reapply every two hours when you're outside.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these tips, you can hydrate your skin for plumper and healthier skin. Remember to be patient, as it may take a few weeks for you to see significant improvements in your skin's hydration levels.</p>
<h2><strong>What is skin hydration and why it's important</strong></h2>
<div><img alt="What is skin hydration and why it's important" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/7_75cc1652-8bdb-4d17-a8ff-d66a8ba7904e_480x480.png?v=1697876939"/></div>
<p>Skin hydration refers to the amount of water content in the skin. It is essential for maintaining healthy and smooth skin. When the skin is properly hydrated, it can better protect the body from external aggressors, such as pollutants and bacteria, and prevent <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/damaged-sensitive-skin">skin damage</a> and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/preventing-premature-ageing-the-ultimate-guide-to-skincare-products">premature aging</a>.</p>
<p>The skin has a natural barrier, which is composed of lipids and proteins, that helps to retain moisture and prevent water loss. However, this barrier can be compromised by environmental factors such as sun exposure, harsh weather, and excessive use of soap or hot water. When the skin barrier is damaged, it can result in dry, itchy, and flaky skin.</p>
<p>Proper skin hydration helps to maintain the skin barrier, keeping the skin moisturized and preventing water loss. This can improve the skin's elasticity, reduce the appearance of <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-skin-renewer-retinol-serum">fine lines and wrinkles</a>, and improve the overall texture and appearance of the skin. Additionally, hydrated skin can help to reduce the risk of developing skin problems such as acne, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/eczema">eczema</a>, and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/psoriasis">psoriasis</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, it's important to maintain proper skin hydration through a healthy lifestyle, drinking plenty of water, using moisturizers, and avoiding harsh environmental factors that can lead to dry skin.</p>
<div></div>
<h2><strong>Causes of Dehydrated skin</strong></h2>
<div><img alt="Causes of Dehydrated skin" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/8_25678999-58cf-4d5c-84c6-8ff02aa4f04b_480x480.png?v=1697876989"/></div>
<p>Dehydrated skin occurs when the skin lacks sufficient water content, which can lead to a dry, rough, and flaky appearance. There are several causes of dehydrated skin, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Environmental factors</strong>: Exposure to cold or dry air, wind, and harsh sunlight can cause dehydration by stripping moisture from the skin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Overuse of skincare products</strong>: Overusing certain skincare products, such as cleansers and exfoliants, can disrupt the skin's natural barrier and lead to dehydration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hot showers and baths</strong>: Hot water can strip the skin of its natural oils, causing dehydration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medical conditions</strong>: Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes and hypothyroidism, can lead to dehydrated skin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Age</strong>: As we age, our skin naturally becomes less able to retain moisture, leading to dehydration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diet</strong>: A diet lacking in essential fatty acids and vitamins can contribute to dehydrated skin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medications</strong>: Certain medications, such as diuretics, can cause dehydration by increasing urine output.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To prevent and treat dehydrated skin, it is important to drink plenty of water, avoid harsh skin care products, take shorter and cooler showers, and eat a balanced diet rich in essential fatty acids and vitamins. Additionally, using a hydrating moisturizer and incorporating a hydrating serum into your skincare routine can help restore moisture to the skin.</p>
<h2><strong>Difference between Moisturizing and Hydrating</strong></h2>
<div><img alt="Difference between Moisturizing and Hydrating" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/9_779a5236-5d7c-4b59-a07a-e6f421c3046c_480x480.png?v=1697877045"/></div>
<p>Moisturizing and hydrating are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same thing. Here's the difference:</p>
<p>Moisturizing refers to the process of adding a layer of oil or other emollient to the skin to prevent water loss and keep the skin feeling soft and supple. Moisturizers typically contain ingredients like oils, butters, and occlusives that help to seal in moisture and prevent dehydration.</p>
<p>Hydrating, on the other hand, refers to the process of adding water or moisture to the skin to improve its moisture content. Hydrating products contain ingredients like humectants, which attract water molecules to the skin and help to bind them there, and may also contain emollients to help seal in moisture.</p>
<p>In short, moisturizing focuses on preventing water loss from the skin, while hydrating focuses on adding water to the skin. Both processes are important for maintaining healthy, well-hydrated skin.</p>
<h2><strong>How to keep skin hydrated</strong></h2>

<p>There are several ways to keep your skin hydrated:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid hot water</strong>: Hot water can strip the skin of its natural oils and lead to dryness. Try to use lukewarm water when washing your face or taking a shower.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid harsh soaps and cleansers</strong>: Harsh soaps and cleansers can strip the skin of its natural oils, leading to dryness. Look for gentle, pH-balanced cleansers that won't disrupt your skin's natural moisture barrier.</p>

<div>
<p><span><img alt="Use cool water to wash" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/11_51a3e7c8-3ea1-4756-bdcc-610bbda58134_480x480.png?v=1697877157"/></span></p>
</div>
<p>Cool water is a great choice for washing certain items or for certain purposes. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Clothes</strong>: When washing clothes, using cool water can help prevent fading and shrinkage. It's also a good option for delicate fabrics that can be easily damaged by hot water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hair</strong>: Cool water can help close the cuticles of your hair, making it appear smoother and shinier. It's also a good option for those with colour-treated hair, as hot water can cause the color to fade faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Face</strong>: Washing your face with cool water can help soothe and reduce inflammation, especially for those with <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/sensitive-skin">sensitive skin</a> or acne-prone skin.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Body</strong>: Cool water can be refreshing and invigorating, especially during hot weather. It can also help soothe itchy or irritated skin.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, using cool water for washing can have many benefits, but it's important to keep in mind that certain items or situations may require warmer water for optimal cleaning.</p>
<h3><strong>Use Moisturiser</strong></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Use Moisturiser" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/12_ebc5da8a-ba78-4a57-8283-e14bbca8f9f7_480x480.png?v=1697877220"/></span></p>
</div>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improves skin texture</strong>: Using a moisturizer regularly can help to improve the texture of your skin, making it softer, smoother and more supple.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles</strong>: Dry skin can make fine lines and wrinkles more prominent. Moisturizer can help to plump up the skin, reducing the appearance of these signs of aging.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Prevents acne</strong>: Contrary to popular belief, moisturizer doesn't cause <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-the-ultimate-nia-10-niacinamide-serum">acne</a>. In fact, using a moisturizer can help to prevent acne by keeping the skin hydrated and preventing excess oil production.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When choosing a moisturizer, look for one that is suited to your skin type. To determine your skin type its best advised to <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">see a dermatologist</a>.

And remember to apply moisturizer to your face and body daily, after cleansing and toning.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/dry-skin">Dry skin</a> becomes the norm for many people as the weather cools, but that doesn't mean you have to accept it. Whether you have constantly dry skin or are simply experiencing dry patches and stiffness as a result of the cool air, some general advice on how to choose skincare products based on your skin type.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Determine your skin type</strong>: Your skin type can be oily, dry, combination, or sensitive. Each skin type has specific needs, so it's important to determine your skin type before selecting skincare products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Read labels carefully</strong>: Look for products that are formulated specifically for your skin type. Read the label to see if it mentions being suitable for your skin type or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Look for non-comedogenic products</strong>: If you have oily or acne-prone skin, look for products that are labeled "<a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/non-comedogenic-skincare-products">non-comedogenic</a>." These products won't <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/open-pores">clog pores</a> and cause breakouts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid harsh ingredients</strong>: If you have sensitive skin, look for products that are fragrance-free and free from harsh ingredients like alcohol, sulfates, and parabens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider your skin concerns</strong>: If you have specific skin concerns like acne, dark <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">spots</a>, or fine lines, look for products that target those concerns. For example, if you have acne-prone skin, look for products that contain salicylic acid or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/is-benzoyl-peroxide-good-for-acne">benzoyl peroxide</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, everyone's skin is unique, so what works for one person may not work for another. It's important to pay attention to how your skin reacts to different products and adjust your skincare routine accordingly.</p>
<h3><strong>Exfoliate Regularly</strong></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Exfoliate Regularly" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/17_1c4feba1-dc46-413c-8ad4-8a3c01d0f909_480x480.png?v=1697877397"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/exfoliation%20">Exfoliation</a> is the process of removing dead skin cells from the surface of your skin. Regular exfoliation can help to improve the overall appearance and health of your skin by unclogging pores, reducing breakouts, and promoting a brighter, smoother complexion.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for exfoliating regularly:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose the right exfoliant</strong>: There are two main types of exfoliants: physical and chemical. Physical exfoliants include scrubs and brushes that physically slough off dead skin cells, while chemical exfoliants use acids like <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/aha-vs-bha-in-your-skincare-routine">alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs)</a> to dissolve dead skin cells. Choose an exfoliant that suits your skin type and concerns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be gentle</strong>: When exfoliating, it's important to be gentle to avoid damaging your skin. Use light pressure and avoid scrubbing too hard, especially if you're using a physical exfoliant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't overdo it</strong>: While regular exfoliation is important, you don't want to overdo it. Exfoliating too often can strip your skin of its natural oils and lead to irritation. Aim to exfoliate once or twice a week, depending on your skin type and concerns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moisturize after exfoliating</strong>: Exfoliating can leave your skin feeling dry, so be sure to moisturize after you've exfoliated to help lock in moisture and keep your skin hydrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protect your skin</strong>: After exfoliating, your skin may be more sensitive to the sun, so be sure to wear sunscreen to protect your skin from UV damage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these tips and incorporating regular exfoliation into your skincare routine, you can help to keep your skin looking and feeling healthy and radiant.</p>
<h3><strong>Use face masks</strong></h3>

<p>Sunscreen is an essential part of any skincare routine, and it's important to use it every day to protect your skin from the harmful effects of the sun. The sun's UV rays can cause a range of skin problems, from sunburn and premature aging to skin cancer. Here are a few tips for using sunscreen effectively:</p>
<ol>

<li>
<p>Apply sunscreen generously and evenly to all exposed skin, including your face, neck, arms, and legs. Be sure to cover any areas that tend to burn easily, such as your nose, ears, and shoulders.</p>
