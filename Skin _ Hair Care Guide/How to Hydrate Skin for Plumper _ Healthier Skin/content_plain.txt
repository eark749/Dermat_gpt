You probably already know how important hydration is for keeping your skin looking and feeling healthy and radiant. However, you may be unaware that moisturising your skin twice a day is insufficient. A solid skincare routine that hydrates your skin necessitates some manoeuvring and, at times, product hacking.
Hydrating your skin is essential for maintaining its health and appearance. When your skin is properly hydrated, it appears plumper, smoother, and more youthful. Here are some tips for hydrating your skin for plumper and healthier skin:
Drink plenty of water
: Staying hydrated from within is the first and most important step in hydrating your skin. Drinking plenty of water can help keep your skin moisturized and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Use a gentle cleanser
: Avoid harsh cleansers that can strip your skin of its natural oils. Opt for a
gentle cleanser
that is free of sulfates, fragrances, and other irritants.
Apply a hydrating serum
: Serums are highly concentrated formulations that can penetrate deeply into the skin and provide intense hydration. Look for a serum that contains
hyaluronic acid
, which is a powerful humectant that can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water.
Use a moisturizer
: Apply a
moisturizer
after your serum to lock in hydration and prevent moisture loss. Look for a moisturizer that contains ingredients like
ceramides
, glycerin, or shea butter, which can help to strengthen the skin's barrier and prevent dehydration.
Consider a humidifier
: If you live in a dry climate or spend a lot of time in air-conditioned or heated environments, a humidifier can help to add moisture to the air and keep your skin hydrated.
Protect your skin from the sun
: UV rays can damage your skin and contribute to dehydration. Always wear a broad-spectrum
sunscreen
with an SPF of at least 30 and reapply every two hours when you're outside.
By following these tips, you can hydrate your skin for plumper and healthier skin. Remember to be patient, as it may take a few weeks for you to see significant improvements in your skin's hydration levels.
What is skin hydration and why it's important
Skin hydration refers to the amount of water content in the skin. It is essential for maintaining healthy and smooth skin. When the skin is properly hydrated, it can better protect the body from external aggressors, such as pollutants and bacteria, and prevent
skin damage
and
premature aging
.
The skin has a natural barrier, which is composed of lipids and proteins, that helps to retain moisture and prevent water loss. However, this barrier can be compromised by environmental factors such as sun exposure, harsh weather, and excessive use of soap or hot water. When the skin barrier is damaged, it can result in dry, itchy, and flaky skin.
Proper skin hydration helps to maintain the skin barrier, keeping the skin moisturized and preventing water loss. This can improve the skin's elasticity, reduce the appearance of
fine lines and wrinkles
, and improve the overall texture and appearance of the skin. Additionally, hydrated skin can help to reduce the risk of developing skin problems such as acne,
eczema
, and
psoriasis
.
Therefore, it's important to maintain proper skin hydration through a healthy lifestyle, drinking plenty of water, using moisturizers, and avoiding harsh environmental factors that can lead to dry skin.
Causes of Dehydrated skin
Dehydrated skin occurs when the skin lacks sufficient water content, which can lead to a dry, rough, and flaky appearance. There are several causes of dehydrated skin, including:
Environmental factors
: Exposure to cold or dry air, wind, and harsh sunlight can cause dehydration by stripping moisture from the skin.
Overuse of skincare products
: Overusing certain skincare products, such as cleansers and exfoliants, can disrupt the skin's natural barrier and lead to dehydration.
Hot showers and baths
: Hot water can strip the skin of its natural oils, causing dehydration.
Medical conditions
: Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes and hypothyroidism, can lead to dehydrated skin.
Age
: As we age, our skin naturally becomes less able to retain moisture, leading to dehydration.
Diet
: A diet lacking in essential fatty acids and vitamins can contribute to dehydrated skin.
Medications
: Certain medications, such as diuretics, can cause dehydration by increasing urine output.
To prevent and treat dehydrated skin, it is important to drink plenty of water, avoid harsh skin care products, take shorter and cooler showers, and eat a balanced diet rich in essential fatty acids and vitamins. Additionally, using a hydrating moisturizer and incorporating a hydrating serum into your skincare routine can help restore moisture to the skin.
Difference between Moisturizing and Hydrating
Moisturizing and hydrating are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same thing. Here's the difference:
Moisturizing refers to the process of adding a layer of oil or other emollient to the skin to prevent water loss and keep the skin feeling soft and supple. Moisturizers typically contain ingredients like oils, butters, and occlusives that help to seal in moisture and prevent dehydration.
Hydrating, on the other hand, refers to the process of adding water or moisture to the skin to improve its moisture content. Hydrating products contain ingredients like humectants, which attract water molecules to the skin and help to bind them there, and may also contain emollients to help seal in moisture.
In short, moisturizing focuses on preventing water loss from the skin, while hydrating focuses on adding water to the skin. Both processes are important for maintaining healthy, well-hydrated skin.
How to keep skin hydrated
There are several ways to keep your skin hydrated:
Drink plenty of water
: Drinking enough water is one of the simplest and most effective ways to keep your skin hydrated. Water helps to flush out toxins and keep skin plump and supple.
Moisturize regularly
: Using a good moisturizer can help keep your skin hydrated. Look for a moisturizer that contains humectants such as hyaluronic acid or glycerin, which help to draw water into the skin.
Avoid hot water
: Hot water can strip the skin of its natural oils and lead to dryness. Try to use lukewarm water when washing your face or taking a shower.
Use a humidifier
: If you live in a dry climate or spend a lot of time in air-conditioned environments, using a humidifier can help keep your skin hydrated.
Eat a healthy diet
: Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables can help keep your skin healthy and hydrated. Foods like watermelon, cucumber, and spinach are high in water content and can help hydrate your skin from the inside out.
Avoid harsh soaps and cleansers
: Harsh soaps and cleansers can strip the skin of its natural oils, leading to dryness. Look for gentle, pH-balanced cleansers that won't disrupt your skin's natural moisture barrier.
Protect your skin from the sun
: Sun damage can lead to dryness and premature aging. Wear protective clothing and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen to protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays.
Use cool water to wash
Cool water is a great choice for washing certain items or for certain purposes. Here are a few examples:
Clothes
: When washing clothes, using cool water can help prevent fading and shrinkage. It's also a good option for delicate fabrics that can be easily damaged by hot water.
Hair
: Cool water can help close the cuticles of your hair, making it appear smoother and shinier. It's also a good option for those with colour-treated hair, as hot water can cause the color to fade faster.
Face
: Washing your face with cool water can help soothe and reduce inflammation, especially for those with
sensitive skin
or acne-prone skin. It can also help tighten pores and reduce the appearance of puffiness.
Body
: Cool water can be refreshing and invigorating, especially during hot weather. It can also help soothe itchy or irritated skin.
Overall, using cool water for washing can have many benefits, but it's important to keep in mind that certain items or situations may require warmer water for optimal cleaning.
Use Moisturiser
Moisturizer is an essential part of a good skincare routine. It helps to keep your skin hydrated, healthy and looking its best. Here are some reasons why you should use moisturizer:
Hydrates the skin
: Moisturizer helps to keep the skin hydrated by preventing water loss from the skin's surface. This can prevent dryness, flakiness and irritation.
Improves skin texture
: Using a moisturizer regularly can help to improve the texture of your skin, making it softer, smoother and more supple.
Protects the skin
: Moisturizer can act as a protective barrier, shielding the skin from environmental pollutants, UV radiation and other harmful substances.
Reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles
: Dry skin can make fine lines and wrinkles more prominent. Moisturizer can help to plump up the skin, reducing the appearance of these signs of aging.
Prevents acne
: Contrary to popular belief, moisturizer doesn't cause
acne
. In fact, using a moisturizer can help to prevent acne by keeping the skin hydrated and preventing excess oil production.
When choosing a moisturizer, look for one that is suited to your skin type. To determine your skin type its best advised to
see a dermatologist
. If you have oily skin, look for a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer. If you have dry skin, opt for a richer, more emollient formula. And remember to apply moisturizer to your face and body daily, after cleansing and toning.
Use products with Aloe Vera
Aloe vera is a plant that has been used for its medicinal properties for centuries. It is known for its ability to soothe and hydrate the skin, making it a popular ingredient in many skincare and cosmetic products. Here are some ways you can use products with aloe vera:
Moisturizer
: Aloe vera is a great natural moisturizer that can help keep your skin hydrated and healthy. Look for moisturizers that contain aloe vera as a key ingredient to help keep your skin soft and supple.
Sunscreen
: Aloe vera has natural sunscreen properties that can help protect your skin from harmful UV rays. Look for sunscreens that contain aloe vera to help protect your skin while keeping it hydrated.
Shampoo and conditioner
: Aloe vera can also be beneficial for your hair. Look for
shampoos
and
conditioners
that contain aloe vera to help soothe your scalp and hydrate your hair.
Facial cleanser
: Aloe vera can help remove dirt and impurities from your skin while also soothing and hydrating it. Look for facial cleansers that contain aloe vera to help keep your skin clean and healthy.
After-sun care
: If you've spent time in the sun, aloe vera can help soothe and cool your skin. Look for after-sun care products that contain aloe vera to help soothe any sunburn or irritation.
Remember to always patch test new products before applying them to your skin to make sure you're not allergic or sensitive to any of the ingredients.
Use a Humidifier
A humidifier is a device that adds moisture to the air to increase humidity levels in a room or building. Humidifiers are used to alleviate dry air conditions that can lead to discomfort, respiratory problems, and other health issues. Here's how to use a humidifier:
Choose the right type of humidifier
: There are several types of humidifiers available, including cool mist, warm mist, ultrasonic, and evaporative humidifiers. Choose the one that is best suited to your needs.
Fill the water tank
: Make sure the humidifier is unplugged and the water tank is detached. Fill the water tank with clean, cold water. It's important to use clean water to prevent the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms in the humidifier.
Add optional ingredients
: You can add essential oils, herbs, or other ingredients to the water to add fragrance or therapeutic benefits. Follow the instructions of the humidifier to determine how much of each ingredient to add.
Reattach the water tank
: Carefully reattach the water tank to the humidifier, making sure it is properly secured.
Turn on the humidifier
: Plug in the humidifier and turn it on. Adjust the settings to your desired humidity level.
Monitor and maintain the humidifier

Determine your skin type
: Your skin type can be oily, dry, combination, or sensitive. Each skin type has specific needs, so it's important to determine your skin type before selecting skincare products.
Read labels carefully
: Look for products that are formulated specifically for your skin type. Read the label to see if it mentions being suitable for your skin type or not.
Look for non-comedogenic products
: If you have oily or acne-prone skin, look for products that are labeled "
non-comedogenic
." These products won't
clog pores
and cause breakouts.
Avoid harsh ingredients
: If you have sensitive skin, look for products that are fragrance-free and free from harsh ingredients like alcohol, sulfates, and parabens.
Consider your skin concerns
: If you have specific skin concerns like acne, dark
spots
, or fine lines, look for products that target those concerns. For example, if you have acne-prone skin, look for products that contain salicylic acid or
benzoyl peroxide
.
Remember, everyone's skin is unique, so what works for one person may not work for another. It's important to pay attention to how your skin reacts to different products and adjust your skincare routine accordingly.
Exfoliate Regularly
Exfoliation
is the process of removing dead skin cells from the surface of your skin. Regular exfoliation can help to improve the overall appearance and health of your skin by unclogging pores, reducing breakouts, and promoting a brighter, smoother complexion.
Here are some tips for exfoliating regularly:
Choose the right exfoliant
: There are two main types of exfoliants: physical and chemical. Physical exfoliants include scrubs and brushes that physically slough off dead skin cells, while chemical exfoliants use acids like
alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs)
to dissolve dead skin cells. Choose an exfoliant that suits your skin type and concerns.
Be gentle
: When exfoliating, it's important to be gentle to avoid damaging your skin. Use light pressure and avoid scrubbing too hard, especially if you're using a physical exfoliant.
Don't overdo it
: While regular exfoliation is important, you don't want to overdo it. Exfoliating too often can strip your skin of its natural oils and lead to irritation. Aim to exfoliate once or twice a week, depending on your skin type and concerns.
Moisturize after exfoliating
: Exfoliating can leave your skin feeling dry, so be sure to moisturize after you've exfoliated to help lock in moisture and keep your skin hydrated.
Protect your skin
: After exfoliating, your skin may be more sensitive to the sun, so be sure to wear sunscreen to protect your skin from UV damage.
By following these tips and incorporating regular exfoliation into your skincare routine, you can help to keep your skin looking and feeling healthy and radiant.
Use face masks
Face masks are an important tool in reducing the spread of respiratory illnesses, including
COVID-19
. Here are some reasons why wearing a face mask is important:
Protects yourself and others
: Wearing a face mask can help prevent the spread of droplets that may contain the virus that causes COVID-19. By wearing a mask, you are protecting yourself and others around you.
Required in many places
: In many places around the world, it is now mandatory to wear a face mask in public areas. This includes on public transportation, in shops and restaurants, and in many other public spaces.
Easy to use
: Face masks are easy to use and can be worn by people of all ages. They are available in a variety of materials and styles to suit different preferences and needs.
Affordable
: Face masks are generally affordable and widely available, making them accessible to most people.
To properly use a face mask, it's important to follow these guidelines:
Wash your hands thoroughly before putting on your mask.
Make sure the mask covers your nose and mouth, and fits snugly against your face.
Avoid touching the mask while you're wearing it, and if you do touch it, wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.
When removing the mask, handle it by the ear loops or ties, and avoid touching the front of the mask.
Wash your hands thoroughly after removing the mask.
Remember, wearing a face mask is just one part of reducing the spread of COVID-19. It's important to continue practicing good hygiene, including washing your hands regularly, practicing social distancing, and staying home when you're feeling unwell.
Use Sunscreen
Sunscreen is an essential part of any skincare routine, and it's important to use it every day to protect your skin from the harmful effects of the sun. The sun's UV rays can cause a range of skin problems, from sunburn and premature aging to skin cancer. Here are a few tips for using sunscreen effectively:
Choose a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. SPF stands for "sun protection factor" and indicates the level of protection against UVB rays. Higher SPFs provide more protection, but no sunscreen can block all UV rays.
Apply sunscreen generously and evenly to all exposed skin, including your face, neck, arms, and legs. Be sure to cover any areas that tend to burn easily, such as your nose, ears, and shoulders.
Reapply sunscreen every two hours, or more often if you're sweating or swimming. Even water-resistant sunscreens can wear off after a while, so it's important to keep reapplying to maintain protection.
Use sunscreen even on cloudy days. UV rays can penetrate clouds and cause damage to your skin, so it's important to wear sunscreen every day, regardless of the weather.
Wear protective clothing, such as a hat and sunglasses, and seek shade when possible. Sunscreen is just one part of a comprehensive sun protection strategy, so be sure to take other steps to protect your skin as well.
Remember, using sunscreen is an easy and effective way to protect your skin from the harmful effects of the sun. So, make it a habit to use sunscreen every day, and enjoy the great outdoors without worrying about damaging your skin.
Stay Hydrated
Staying hydrated is essential for maintaining good health and well-being. The human body is made up of approximately 60% water, and staying hydrated helps to regulate body temperature, transport nutrients and oxygen throughout the body, flush out waste and toxins, and keep the skin healthy and glowing.
Here are some tips to help you stay hydrated:
Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Aim for at least eight glasses of water a day, and more if you're physically active or live in a hot climate.
Eat foods that have a high-water content. Fruits and vegetables like watermelon, strawberries, cucumber, and lettuce are excellent choices.
Avoid sugary drinks and alcohol, as they can actually dehydrate you.
Keep a water bottle with you at all times, and take sips throughout the day.
Set reminders on your phone or computer to drink water regularly.
Remember, staying hydrated is important for your overall health and well-being, so make sure you prioritize it in your daily routine.
