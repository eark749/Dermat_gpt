If you're struggling with acne, you may be looking for ways to clear your skin and prevent breakouts. One important step in achieving clear, acne-free skin is to avoid ingredients that can irritate your skin or contribute to breakouts, especially if you have acne-prone skin. In this blog, we'll take a look at 9 skincare ingredients that you should avoid if you're trying to achieve clear, acne-free skin. By avoiding these ingredients, you can help to keep your skin healthy and prevent breakouts. Additionally, using skincare products that are formulated without these ingredients can help to support your skin's natural healing process and promote clear, healthy skin.
What causes acne?
There are several possible causes of acne, and the specific cause can vary from person to person. Some common causes of acne include:
Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during puberty,
pregnancy
, or menopause, can increase oil production and lead to acne.
Certain medications, such as steroids or certain types of antidepressants, can also cause
acne
.
Excessive stress can also trigger the production of hormones that can lead to acne.
Using skincare products that are too harsh or irritating can cause acne.
Poor hygiene, such as not washing your face regularly or not removing makeup before bed, can also contribute to the development of acne.
Genetics can also play a role in the development of acne, as some people may be more prone to developing acne due to their genetic makeup.
It's important to talk to a dermatologist if you are experiencing acne, as they can help determine the specific cause of your acne and recommend the most effective treatment options. Get expert skin care advice from the comfort of your own home with

Hormonal influences on acne development
Acne is a common skin condition caused by clogged hair follicles filled with dead skin cells and oil. Hormonal factors play a significant role in the development of acne, particularly during puberty, when hormonal changes are most noticeable. The following hormones have a significant impact on the development of acne:
Androgens
: Androgens are male sex hormones that are present in both males and females in varying amounts. Testosterone is an androgen that causes the skin's sebaceous glands to generate more oil (sebum). Increased sebum production can result in blocked pores and the formation of acne lesions.
Estrogens
: While androgens contribute to acne formation, estrogens (female sex hormones) can be protective. Estrogens help to counteract androgen effects by lowering sebum production and providing a more stable skin environment. As a result, some women's acne may improve while pregnant or using estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.
Progesterone
: Progesterone is another female sex hormone that might contribute to acne formation. It stimulates sebum production and can cause the skin's outer layer to thicken, fostering an acne-friendly environment.
Cortisol
: Stress can have an impact on acne development by inducing the release of the stress hormone cortisol. Elevated cortisol levels can encourage the sebaceous glands to generate more oil, contributing to the production of acne lesions.
These hormones interact differently in different people, and the sensitivity of the sebaceous glands to hormonal changes can influence the severity and persistence of acne. Furthermore, hormonal fluctuations can occur during puberty, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. Treatment plans for hormonal acne frequently include addressing the underlying hormonal imbalances. Methods that are commonly used include:
Oral contraceptives
: Oestrogen and progestin-containing birth control pills can help some women regulate hormonal fluctuations and reduce acne.
Anti-androgen medications
: Acne may be treated with medications that block the effects of androgens or reduce their production.
Retinoids
: These
vitamin A derivatives
help clean pores and prevent the formation of new acne lesions.
Oral and topical antibiotics
: These can be used to manage bacterial overgrowth on the skin and lessen inflammation.
For a customised assessment and treatment plan based on individual factors, it is imperative to consult with a healthcare provider or dermatologist. The best course of action may vary depending on the hormonal profile and other factors influencing acne development.
Impact of diet and lifestyle on acne
Diet and lifestyle can have a big impact on acne development and severity. While everyone's reactions to different foods and habits differ, several factors are frequently linked to acne:
High-Glycemic Foods
: Diets high in high-glycemic foods, such as sugary snacks, white bread, and processed cereals, may aggravate acne. These foods can cause blood sugar and insulin spikes, which stimulate sebum production and contribute to clogged pores.
Dairy Products
: Some studies suggest that consuming dairy products, particularly skim milk, may increase the risk of acne. It is thought that certain milk components, such as hormones and growth factors, may affect acne development.
Omega-6 Fatty Acids
: A diet high in omega-6 fatty acids and low in omega-3 fatty acids may promote inflammation and worsen acne. A healthy diet rich in these essential fatty acids may benefit skin health.
Hydration
: Proper hydration is critical for overall skin health. Dehydration can cause an increase in oil production to compensate for the lack of moisture, potentially contributing to acne.
Nutrient Intake
: Acne has been linked to deficiencies in nutrients such as
zinc
, vitamin A, and
vitamin E
. The general health of your skin depends on eating a diet that is well-balanced and getting enough vitamins and minerals.
Stress
: Prolonged stress can lead to the release of hormones like cortisol, which may aggravate or cause acne to appear. Stress-reduction methods like physical activity, mindfulness, or deep breathing could lessen this impact.
Smoking
: Smoking has been associated with a higher risk of acne, most likely as a result of its detrimental effects on circulation and general skin health.
Skincare Routines
: Applying harsh or
pore-clogging
(comedogenic) skincare products can exacerbate acne. It is critical to select products that are appropriate for one's skin type and to adhere to a gentle and consistent skincare routine.
While these relationships have been discovered, keep in mind that individual responses to dietary and lifestyle factors can vary. Furthermore, the relationship between nutrition and acne is complicated, and more research is required to establish clear cause-and-effect relationships. If you are concerned about your acne or skin health, speaking with a dermatologist or healthcare professional can assist you in identifying specific triggers and designing a treatment plan that is tailored to your specific needs.
9 Ingredients to avoid for acne-prone skin
Acne is a common skin condition caused by a variety of factors including genetics, hormones, and certain skincare ingredients. If you have acne-prone skin, it is critical to be aware of and avoid the ingredients in your skincare routine that can cause breakouts. If you have acne-prone skin, here are 9 ingredients to avoid:
Sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulphate (SLES) are common foaming agents in cleansers and shampoos. While they effectively cleanse the skin and hair, they can also strip the skin of its natural oils and irritate the skin, causing breakouts.
Although alcohol is commonly used in toners and astringents, it can be extremely drying and irritating to the skin. This can result in excessive oil production and clogged pores, both of which can result in acne.
Many skincare products contain synthetic fragrances to provide a pleasant scent, but they can be irritating to the skin and cause acne.
Parabens are a type of preservative that is commonly found in skincare products. They can irritate the skin and disrupt hormone levels, leading to acne.
Propylene glycol is a
humectant
found in skincare products that helps to keep skin hydrated. However, it has the potential to clog pores and cause breakouts.
Mineral oil is a common ingredient in
moisturisers
, but it can clog pores and cause acne.
Silicones are frequently used in skincare products to improve the texture and consistency. They can, however, form a barrier on the skin, trapping oil and bacteria and causing breakouts.
Phthalates are a type of chemical that is used to make plastics more flexible. They are commonly found in perfumed products, including skincare, and can cause hormonal disruption, resulting in acne.
Retinoids are a type of compound that is frequently used to treat acne. While they have the potential to be effective, they can also cause skin irritation and breakouts.
If you have acne-prone skin, be mindful of the components in your skincare products and avoid those that have been linked to breakouts. Look for products that are specifically intended for acne-prone skin and are free of these components. In addition, your dermatologist can advise you on the finest skincare products and treatments for your specific form of acne.
Common irritants in skincare products
Skincare products may contain a variety of ingredients, some of which may be irritating to some people. The following are examples of common irritants found in skincare products:
Fragrances
: Synthetic fragrances, as well as some natural fragrances, can irritate sensitive skin. Fragrance-free or "unscented" products (meaning no added fragrance) are frequently better choices for those with sensitive skin.
Alcohol
: High concentrations of alcohol may be found in some skincare products, particularly toners and astringents. While alcohol can aid in product absorption, it can also be drying and irritating, especially on dry or sensitive skin.
Harsh Cleansers
: Some cleansing agents, such as sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) and sodium
laureth
sulphate (SLES), can be too harsh for some people, causing dryness and irritation.
Preservatives
: Some preservatives, such as parabens, can irritate some people. Parabens are used to extend the shelf life of products, but some individuals may be sensitive or allergic to them.
Essential Oils
: While natural, essential oils can be potent and irritate some individuals. Citrus oils, mint oils, and tea tree oil are examples of essential oils that may cause sensitivity.
Retinoids
: Retinoids, including prescription-strength products like tretinoin and over-the-counter retinol, can cause irritation, redness, and peeling, especially when first starting their use. It's essential to introduce retinoids gradually and follow proper application guidelines.
Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs) and Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHAs)
: Ingredients like
glycolic acid
(an
AHA
) and
salicylic acid
(a BHA) are common in exfoliating products. While they can be beneficial for skin renewal, they may also irritate, especially if used in high concentrations or too frequently.
Allergens
: Certain plant extracts, nut oils, and other ingredients in skincare products can cause allergic reactions in sensitive people.
Silicones
: While silicones are generally well-tolerated, some people may find them occlusive in skincare products, causing breakouts or irritation.
Artificial Colours
: Synthetic dyes and colourants are used in some skincare products for aesthetic purposes, but they can irritate sensitive skin.
It's important for individuals to be aware of their skin sensitivities and to read ingredient lists carefully when choosing skincare products. Patch testing new products on a small area of skin can help identify potential irritants before applying the product to the entire face or body. If someone experiences persistent irritation or an allergic reaction, they should discontinue use and consult with a dermatologist. Additionally, seeking fragrance-free or hypoallergenic products may be beneficial for individuals with sensitive skin.
Understanding comedogenic ratings
Comedogenic ratings are a system for categorising the likelihood of specific chemicals or products causing comedones, which are non-inflammatory acne lesions such as
blackheads
and
whiteheads
. The scale normally goes from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating non-comedogenicity (least likely to create comedones) and 5 indicating extremely comedogenicity (very likely to induce comedones). The following is a broad breakdown of comedogenic ratings:
0 - Non-comedogenic
: Ingredients rated 0 are thought to be unlikely to clog pores or cause acne. They are suitable for the majority of skin types, including
sensitive
and acne-prone skin.
1 - Low Comedogenic
: Ingredients with a rating of one are unlikely to cause comedones. While they are generally safe for the majority of people, those with extremely sensitive or acne-prone skin should exercise caution.
2 - Moderately Comedogenic
: Ingredients with a rating of 2 are likely to cause comedones. Individuals with acne-prone skin should exercise caution, especially if using products containing multiple moderately comedogenic ingredients.
3 - Comedogenic
: Comedogenic ingredients are those that have a higher likelihood of causing pore blockage and acne in some people. People with acne-prone or sensitive skin should exercise caution when using products containing these ingredients.
4 - Highly Comedogenic
: Ingredients rated 4 are extremely likely to cause comedones. Most people, especially those with acne-prone skin, should avoid products containing these ingredients.
5 - Extremely Comedogenic
: Ingredients with a rating of 5 are considered extremely comedogenic and are more likely to cause comedones. These ingredients should be avoided by anyone who has acne-prone or sensitive skin.
It should be noted that comedogenic ratings are not universal, and various skin types can respond differently to the same substance. Furthermore, the concentration of a component in a product, as well as the product's formulation, might influence its comedogenic potential. If you are concerned about acne or skin sensitivities, patch test new products on a tiny area of skin before incorporating them into your routine. If you have specific skin concerns or conditions, a dermatologist can assist you in selecting products that are appropriate for your skin type.
Clear, healthy skin starts with avoiding these 9 ingredients
In conclusion, if you have acne-prone skin, it's important to be aware of the ingredients that can trigger breakouts and to avoid them in your skincare routine. Some common acne-causing ingredients to avoid include sodium lauryl sulphate, alcohol, synthetic fragrances, parabens,
propylene glycol
, mineral oil, silicones, phthalates, retinoids, and isotretinoin. Instead, look for skincare products that are formulated with acne-fighting ingredients and are free from these harmful ingredients. Additionally, be sure to follow a
gentle skincare routine
and avoid picking at or squeezing your pimples. By taking these steps, you can help prevent breakouts and maintain clear, healthy skin.
Types of acne: Symptoms of different acne types
There are several different types of acne, and they can vary in severity and appearance. Here are three common types of acne:
Blackheads
, which are small, dark-colored bumps that form when a clogged hair follicle fills with oil and dead skin cells. They typically appear on the face, neck, chest, and back.
Whiteheads
, which are small, white bumps that form when a clogged hair follicle is closed off by a thin layer of skin. They are similar to blackheads, but they are not visible on the surface of the skin.
Papules
, which are large, pus-filled bumps that form deep within the skin. They are often painful and can leave scars if not treated properly.
In addition to these common types of acne, there are also other less common forms, such as nodules, papules, and pustules. It's important to talk to a dermatologist if you are experiencing any type of acne, as they can help diagnose the type of acne and recommend the best treatment and options.
Navigating skincare labels: What to look for
The numerous ingredients and claims on skincare labels can make it difficult to navigate. Here are some key tips on what to look for when reading skincare labels:
Ingredient List
: Ingredients are listed in descending order of concentration, with the highest concentration appearing first. Pay close attention to the first few ingredients, as they have the greatest influence on the product's formulation.
Comedogenic Ratings
: Check the comedogenic ratings of ingredients if you have acne-prone skin. If you are worried about clogged pores and breakouts, avoid products with high comedogenic ingredients.
Fragrance-Free or Unscented
: Fragrances can irritate some people, particularly those with sensitive skin. If you want to avoid irritation, look for products labelled "fragrance-free" or "unscented."
Skin Type Recommendations
: Some products are designed for specific skin types (e.g., oily, dry, sensitive). Choose products that are appropriate for your skin type for the best results.
Hypoallergenic
: Hypoallergenic products are designed to reduce the likelihood of allergic reactions. While this term is not regulated, it can indicate that the product has been allergen tested.
Dermatologist-Tested or Recommended
: Products with dermatologist endorsements may provide additional assurance about their safety and efficacy.
SPF (Sun Protection Factor)
: When looking for sun protection, look for products with an SPF.
Sunscreen
is essential for preventing premature ageing and skin cancer.
Expiration Date
: Skincare products have a shelf life, and using them after that date can make them less effective or even harmful. Look for the "period after opening" (PAO) symbol, which indicates how long the product is good for after it has been opened.
Alcohol Content
: If you have dry or sensitive skin, you should avoid products with a high alcohol content because they can be drying. Look for products that are "alcohol-free" or have lower alcohol concentrations.
Clinically Proven
: Clinically proven products have undergone testing to support specific claims. However, be cautious because this term can be interpreted broadly. Look for studies or research references when they are available.
Cruelty-Free and Vegan
: Look for relevant logos or statements on the label if you prefer cruelty-free or vegan products.
pH Level
: A product's pH level can affect its skin compatibility. Products that have the same
pH as the skin
(around 4.7 to 5.75) are generally gentler.
Keep in mind that everyone's skin is different, so what works for one person might not work for another. It is critical to patch-test new products and gradually integrate them into your routine. If you have specific skincare concerns or conditions, consulting with a dermatologist can provide personalised recommendations based on your skin's needs.
