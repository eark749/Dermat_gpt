<p>Retinaldehyde, also known as retinal, is a powerful skincare ingredient belonging to the retinoid family. Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that have been widely used in skincare products for their numerous benefits, including anti-aging and acne treatment. Retinaldehyde is considered a milder alternative to retinol, offering similar benefits without the harsh side effects that some people may experience with retinol.</p>
<h2><strong>Retinaldehyde vs Retinol: Key Differences</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Potency</strong>: Retinaldehyde is more potent than retinol. It is closer to the active form of vitamin A (retinoic acid) and requires only one conversion step within the skin, whereas retinol needs two.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Irritation</strong>: Due to its higher potency, retinaldehyde is typically less irritating than retinol, making it an excellent option for those with sensitive skin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stability</strong>: Retinaldehyde is more stable than retinol, which means it's less likely to degrade when exposed to light and air. This ensures that the product maintains its efficacy over time</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Retinaldehyde works by increasing cell turnover and stimulating collagen production, which improves skin's overall appearance and health. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce acne and other skin concerns. Here's a breakdown of how retinaldehyde impacts your skin:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It accelerates the skin's natural exfoliation process, shedding dead skin cells and promoting new cell growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It boosts collagen production, which improves skin elasticity and firmness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It reduces hyperpigmentation by inhibiting melanin synthesis, leading to a more even skin tone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has anti-inflammatory properties that can help soothe and calm irritated skin.</p>
