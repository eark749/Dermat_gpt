<p><span>Combining lactic acid and AHAs (alpha hydroxy acids) is a great way to boost exfoliation, target different layers of the skin, improve the absorption of other skincare products, and address multiple skin concerns. To avoid irritation when combining lactic acid and AHAs, start slowly and patch test. To incorporate these ingredients into your skincare routine, start with a low concentration, use once a week, alternate with other exfoliants, and protect your skin. You can improve your skincare results by combining lactic acid and AHAs. This will result in smoother, brighter, and more even-toned skin.</span></p>
<h2><b>What Are Lactic Acid and AHAs?</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="Can I use lactic acid and AHA together?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/3_e7b0e950-4a8d-4596-bff6-862deed6c7f1_480x480.png?v=1681733526"/></b></p>
<p><span>Both lactic acid and AHAs (alpha hydroxy acids) are chemical exfoliants used in skincare to help remove dead skin cells and promote cell turnover. Lactic acid is a form of AHA derived from milk. It works by weakening the bonds between dead skin cells, allowing them to shed more easily. Lactic acid is a gentler exfoliant than other AHAs like glycolic acid, making it an excellent choice for sensitive skin.</span></p>
<p><span>AHAs are a type of water-soluble acid that is derived from fruit and milk sugars. In addition to lactic acid, other common AHAs include glycolic acid, citric acid, and malic acid, which are all derived from apples, citrus fruits, and sugar cane, respectively. AHAs work by breaking down the bonds that hold dead skin cells together, allowing them to slough off more easily. They also stimulate collagen production, which can aid in the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles. Lactic acid and AHAs are both effective exfoliants and promote cell turnover, which can help to improve skin texture, tone, and appearance. They can, however, be irritating if used in high concentrations or too frequently. Before incorporating these ingredients into your skincare routine, start with a low concentration and perform a patch test.</span></p>
<h3><b>Lactic Acid: A Gentle Exfoliator for Smoother Skin</b></h3>
<p><span>Lactic acid is a mild exfoliant that can help improve skin texture, tone, and appearance. Here's how it works and how to use it in your skincare routine:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>How lactic acid works</b><span>: Lactic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA), which helps dead skin cells shed more readily by dissolving the bonds that hold them together. In order to lessen the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, it also aids in stimulating collagen production.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Benefits of lactic acid</b><span>: Lactic acid is a mild exfoliant that is less likely to irritate the skin than other AHAs, such as glycolic acid. It can help to improve the skin's tone and texture, lessen the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles, and encourage a more uniform skin tone. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>How to use lactic acid</b><span>: Lactic acid is present in a wide range of skincare products, including cleansers, toners, serums, and masks. Before incorporating it into your routine, start with a low concentration (around 5%) and patch test. Begin by applying the product once or twice a week, gradually increasing the frequency of application as your skin adjusts. During the day, always use moisturizer and sunscreen, as lactic acid can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Who should use lactic acid</b><span>: Lactic acid is a gentler exfoliant than some other AHAs, making it a good choice for those with sensitive or dry skin. It can, however, be used on all skin types as long as it is used correctly and in the correct concentration.</span></p>

<h3><b>Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs): A Family of Powerful Exfoliants</b></h3>
<p><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/best-exfoliants-for-face-skin">Alpha hydroxy acids</a> (AHAs) are a class of water-soluble acids that are commonly used to exfoliate the skin in skincare products. What you should know about AHAs is as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>How AHAs work</b><span>: AHAs work by breaking down the bonds between dead skin cells, making them easier to slough off. They also stimulate collagen production, which can aid in the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Types of AHAs</b><span>: There are several different types of AHAs, including glycolic acid (derived from sugar cane), lactic acid (derived from milk), citric acid (derived from citrus fruits), and malic acid (derived from apples).</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Benefits of AHAs</b><span>: AHAs can help to improve the skin's tone, texture, and overall appearance. They can also encourage a more even skin tone, lessen the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles, and help reduce their appearance.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>How to use AHAs</b><span>: Cleansers, toners, serums, and masks are just a few skincare products that contain AHAs. It's crucial, to begin with, a low concentration and conduct a patch test before incorporating these into your daily routine. As your skin adjusts, start by using the product once or twice a week and then gradually increase the frequency of use. Always use a moisturizer after an AHA because it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Also, use sunscreen during the day.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Who should use AHAs</b><span>: Although AHAs are generally safe for all skin types, those with sensitive or dry skin should exercise caution when using them. AHAs should also be avoided if you have active skin conditions such as eczema or rosacea.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>AHAs are a class of water-soluble acids that can help improve skin texture, tone, and appearance. Start with a low concentration and a patch test before increasing the frequency of use if you want to incorporate AHAs into your skincare routine. When using exfoliating products, always use a moisturizer and sunscreen.</span></p>
<h3><b>Comparing Lactic Acid with Other AHAs</b></h3>
<p><span>Lactic acid is a type of alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) with some distinct advantages and properties when compared to other AHAs. Here's a comparison of lactic acid to some other commonly used AHAs:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Glycolic acid</b><span>: This AHA is also frequently found in skincare products. It can penetrate the skin more deeply than lactic acid because it has a smaller molecular size. This could increase its ability to exfoliate the skin but also increase the likelihood that it will irritate or irritate sensitive skin. Those with oily or acne-prone skin are frequently advised to use glycolic acid, whereas people with dry or sensitive skin may benefit more from using lactic acid.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Citric acid</b><span>: This AHA is also frequently found in skincare products. It comes from citrus fruits and is similar to lactic acid in terms of molecular size. It is a mild exfoliant that, like lactic acid, can help to improve the texture and appearance of the skin. Citric acid, however, might not be as good as lactic acid at promoting collagen production.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Mandelic acid</b><span>: Almonds are the source of this AHA, known as mandelic acid. It penetrates the skin more slowly than lactic acid and glycolic acid because it has a larger molecular size. Those with sensitive skin or those who are new to using AHAs may find it to be a good option because of this. The antibacterial qualities of <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/nightly-nourishment-is-using-mandelic-acid-every-night-the-key-to-radiant-skin">mandelic acid</a> make it a good option for people with acne-prone skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Lactic acid is a mild AHA that is ideal for people with dry or sensitive skin. It has a larger molecular size than glycolic acid, so it penetrates the skin more slowly and causes less irritation. Citric acid may be less effective at promoting collagen production even though its molecules are the same size as those of lactic acid. Mandelic acid is known for its antibacterial properties and has a larger molecular size than both lactic and glycolic acids.</span></p>
<h2><b>Can You Use Lactic Acid and AHAs Together?</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="Can I use lactic acid and AHA together?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/klklkj_16f00111-4447-46e9-9fd7-ca696e6798bd_480x480.png?v=1681733878"/></b></p>
<p><span>Lactic acid and AHAs can be used together in your skincare regimen, but you must do so gradually and with caution. Exfoliants like lactic acid and AHAs can improve the texture and appearance of the skin, but using too many exfoliants at once can irritate the skin or over-exfoliate it. If you want to include both lactic acid and AHAs in your skincare routine, start by using them on different days or alternating between them. For example, you could use a lactic acid serum one night and an AHA toner the next. You could also use a lactic acid product in the morning and an AHA product at night.</span></p>
<p><span>It's important to keep an eye on how your skin is responding and to modify your routine as necessary. You should cut back on the frequency or concentration of your exfoliants if you experience irritation or sensitivity symptoms like redness, itching, or flaking. It is best to speak with a dermatologist or skincare expert if you are unsure of how to safely and effectively incorporate lactic acid and AHAs into your routine. They can make personalized recommendations based on your skin type, concerns, and goals.</span></p>
<h3><b>Understanding Ingredient Compatibility and Overlap</b></h3>
<p><span>Understanding ingredient overlap and compatibility is necessary to develop a safe and efficient skincare routine. Here are some key points to remember:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Ingredient compatibility</b><span>: Some skincare ingredients complement each other and can enhance their benefits. For example, as previously discussed, ferulic acid and niacinamide are an effective combination because they both protect and brighten the skin. Other examples of compatible ingredients include vitamin C and vitamin E, which can enhance each other's antioxidant properties, as well as retinol and hyaluronic acid, which can help to hydrate and plump the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Ingredient overlap</b><span>: Some skincare ingredients, on the other hand, can overlap or duplicate each other's effects, causing irritation or over-exfoliation. Using both a physical exfoliant (such as a scrub) and a chemical exfoliant (such as lactic acid) can be too harsh for the skin, causing redness, sensitivity, and even micro-tears. Similarly, using multiple products containing high concentrations of AHAs or BHAs may be too much for the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Personalization is key</b><span>: Personalizing your skincare routine to your specific skin type, concerns, and goals is the key to creating an effective and safe skincare routine. Because everyone's skin is different and may react differently to certain ingredients or combinations of ingredients, this may require some trial and error. It's critical to monitor how your skin reacts and adjust your routine accordingly. If you notice any signs of irritation, sensitivity, or over-exfoliation, you may need to reduce the frequency or concentration of certain ingredients, or you may need to eliminate them entirely.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>When creating your skincare routine, keep ingredient compatibility and overlap in mind. You can create a routine that is both effective and safe for your skin by taking a personalized approach and paying attention to how your skin reacts.</span></p>
