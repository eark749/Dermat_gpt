<h3><b>Anagain hair regrowth mechanism</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Anagain hair regrowth mechanism" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Anagain_hair_regrowth_mechanism_480x480.jpg?v=1721644332"/></div>
<p><span>Anagain is a patented ingredient derived from organic pea sprouts that is marketed for its potential to promote hair growth and reduce hair loss. The mechanism by which Anagain is believed to work involves several steps:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Dermal papilla cells are found at the base of hair follicles and play an important role in hair growth. Anagain is thought to increase the activity of dermal papilla cells, promoting their proliferation and function.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Anagain is thought to cause the release of several growth factors and signalling molecules involved in the hair growth cycle. These factors may include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), which all promote hair follicle development and regeneration.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The hair growth cycle is divided into three phases: anagen (growth), catagen (transition), and telogen (resting). Anagain is thought to prolong the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle, resulting in greater hair growth and density over time.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Androgenetic alopecia (male and female pattern baldness) is distinguished by follicular miniaturisation. Anagain may help protect against follicle miniaturisation by increasing the survival and vitality of hair follicles, preventing premature shrinkage and loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Proper blood flow and microcirculation in the scalp are critical for delivering nutrients and oxygen to the hair follicles. Anagain is recommended to improve scalp microcirculation, ensuring the best conditions for hair follicle growth and function.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Anagain may shorten the duration of the telogen (resting) phase of the hair growth cycle, allowing more follicles to return to the active growth phase (anagen) more quickly and efficiently.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Anagain clinical trials</b></h3>
