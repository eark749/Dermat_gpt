Anagain is a patented hair growth ingredient that is derived from pea sprouts. It is a botanical ingredient that is designed to stimulate hair growth and improve hair density.
Anagain
contains nutrients and bioactive compounds that nourish hair follicles and help promote healthy hair growth.
Anagain works by stimulating the dermal papilla cells, which are responsible for hair growth, and promoting the anagen phase of hair growth, which is the active phase of hair growth. By promoting the anagen phase, Anagain helps to extend the growth phase of hair and reduce the hair shedding phase, resulting in thicker, fuller hair.
Anagain is commonly used in hair care products, such as shampoos, conditioners, and hair serums, to help promote hair growth and improve hair density. It is considered a safe and effective ingredient for hair growth and has been shown to produce visible results in as little as three months of use.
Benefits of Anagain for Hair loss

Anagain hair regrowth mechanism
Anagain is a patented ingredient derived from organic pea sprouts that is marketed for its potential to promote hair growth and reduce hair loss. The mechanism by which Anagain is believed to work involves several steps:
Dermal papilla cells are found at the base of hair follicles and play an important role in hair growth. Anagain is thought to increase the activity of dermal papilla cells, promoting their proliferation and function.
Anagain is thought to cause the release of several growth factors and signalling molecules involved in the hair growth cycle. These factors may include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), which all promote hair follicle development and regeneration.
The hair growth cycle is divided into three phases: anagen (growth), catagen (transition), and telogen (resting). Anagain is thought to prolong the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle, resulting in greater hair growth and density over time.
Androgenetic alopecia (male and female pattern baldness) is distinguished by follicular miniaturisation. Anagain may help protect against follicle miniaturisation by increasing the survival and vitality of hair follicles, preventing premature shrinkage and loss.
Proper blood flow and microcirculation in the scalp are critical for delivering nutrients and oxygen to the hair follicles. Anagain is recommended to improve scalp microcirculation, ensuring the best conditions for hair follicle growth and function.
Anagain may shorten the duration of the telogen (resting) phase of the hair growth cycle, allowing more follicles to return to the active growth phase (anagen) more quickly and efficiently.
Anagain clinical trials
Anagain, a patented ingredient derived from organic pea sprouts, has undergone several clinical trials to determine its efficacy in promoting hair growth and reducing hair loss. These clinical studies indicate that Anagain may have potential as a hair growth-promoting ingredient, with positive results observed in both men and women with thinning or hair loss. However, more research, including larger-scale clinical trials with longer follow-up periods, is required to confirm its efficacy and safety for long-term use in hair regrowth.
Anagain hair care products
While the effectiveness of Anagain products have not been scientifically proven, some users have reported positive results, including thicker, stronger hair and reduced hair shedding. As with any hair care product, individual results may vary, and it's important to carefully read and follow the instructions on the packaging.
If you're considering using Anagain products or any other hair care products, it's always a good idea to
talk to a dermatologist
to ensure they're appropriate for your hair type and any specific concerns you may have.
