<p><span>Both dandruff and scalp psoriasis can cause flaking of the scalp, so it can be difficult to distinguish between the two conditions based on symptoms alone. However, there are some differences that can help you determine which condition you may have.</span></p>
<p><span>Dandruff is a common condition characterised by the appearance of white or yellow flakes of dead skin on the scalp and in the hair. It is usually not accompanied by scalp redness or inflammation and is easily treated with over-the-counter dandruff shampoos. Dandruff is not contagious and is not a life-threatening condition.</span></p>
<p><span>Scalp psoriasis, on the other hand, is a chronic autoimmune condition that causes thick, silvery scales and red patches on the scalp. Itching and inflammation are common symptoms, and they may be more difficult to treat than dandruff. Scalp psoriasis is not contagious, but it is more unpleasant and embarrassing than dandruff.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are experiencing symptoms of dandruff or scalp psoriasis, it is important to see a dermatologist or a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is Scalp Psoriasis?</b></h2>
<div><img alt="What is Scalp Psoriasis?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/What_is_Scalp_Psoriasis_480x480.jpg?v=1720161249"/></div>
<p><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/psoriasis"><b>Psoriasis</b></a><span> of the scalp is a chronic skin condition characterised by red,</span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/itchy-irritated-scalp"> </a><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/itchy-irritated-scalp"><b>itchy</b></a><span>, scaly patches on the scalp. It happens when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy skin cells, causing them to grow too quickly and accumulate on the skin's surface. Excess skin cells form thick, silvery scales that can be painful and unpleasant.</span></p>
<p><span>Scalp psoriasis can appear anywhere on the scalp, but it is most common on the back of the head, behind the ears, and along the hairline. It can spread to the forehead, neck, and ears in some cases. Hair loss can occur as a result of the condition, but it is usually temporary.</span></p>
<p><span>Scalp psoriasis is a chronic disease that can reoccur throughout one's life. Treatments are available, however, to help manage symptoms and reduce the frequency of flare-ups. Topical treatments such as medicated shampoos, corticosteroids, and salicylic acid are examples, as are light therapy and systemic medications.</span></p>
<h3><b>Causes of Psoriasis</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Causes of Psoriasis" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Causes_of_Psoriasis_480x480.jpg?v=1720161319"/></div>
<p><span>Psoriasis is an autoimmune skin condition that is chronic. The precise cause of psoriasis is unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of the genetic, immune system, and environmental factors.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Genetic factors</b><span>: Psoriasis can run in families, and researchers have identified several genes that are associated with the condition. Having a family history of psoriasis can increase the likelihood of developing the condition.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Immune system dysfunction</b><span>: In people with psoriasis, the immune system is overactive and attacks healthy skin cells. This leads to inflammation and the formation of plaques on the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Environmental triggers</b><span>:</span> Environmental factors<span> such as infections, injury to the skin, stress, and certain medications can trigger psoriasis or make symptoms worse. Smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and obesity can also increase the risk of developing psoriasis.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Psychological factors</b><span>: Stress and anxiety can trigger or worsen psoriasis symptoms in some people.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>It is important to note that, while these risk factors may contribute to the development of psoriasis, they do not guarantee that the condition will develop. Furthermore, the severity and presentation of psoriasis can vary greatly, with some people experiencing mild symptoms and others experiencing more severe and widespread involvement.</span></p>
<h3><b>Symptoms of Psoriasis</b></h3>

<p><span>Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that causes a rapid build-up of skin cells. There is currently no cure for psoriasis, but there are many treatment options that can help people with the condition manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Topical treatments</b><span>: These are creams, lotions, or ointments that are applied directly to the skin. They can help reduce inflammation, redness, and scaling. Examples include corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, retinoids, and coal tar.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Phototherapy</b><span>: This treatment involves exposing the skin to ultraviolet light, which can slow the growth of skin cells and reduce inflammation. Phototherapy can be done in a doctor's office or at home with a special light box.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Systemic medications</b><span>: These are prescription drugs that are taken orally or by injection. They work throughout the body to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. Examples include methotrexate, cyclosporine, and biological drugs like TNF inhibitors and IL-17 inhibitors.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span> </span><b>Alternative therapies</b><span>: Some people find that complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, meditation, and yoga, can help manage their psoriasis symptoms. However, it's important to talk to a doctor before trying any alternative treatments.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>It's important to work with a dermatologist or other healthcare provider to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your specific needs and preferences. They can advise you on the best treatment options based on the severity and location of your psoriasis, as well as any other medical conditions or medications you are taking.</span></p>
<h3><b>Managing Scalp Psoriasis: Lifestyle Tips</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Managing Scalp Psoriasis: Lifestyle Tips" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Managing_Scalp_Psoriasis__Lifestyle_Tips_480x480.jpg?v=1720161447"/></div>
<p><span>Managing scalp psoriasis requires a combination of lifestyle changes, self-care practices, and medical treatments to alleviate symptoms and reduce flare-ups. Here are some lifestyle tips for dealing with scalp psoriasis:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Maintain Good Scalp Hygiene</b><span>: Wash your hair on a regular basis with a gentle shampoo to remove excess oil, scales, and buildup from the scalp. Avoid using harsh or irritating hair care products, which can aggravate psoriasis symptoms. Use lukewarm water rather than hot water, as hot water can strip the scalp of natural oils, exacerbating dryness and irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Moisturize the Scalp</b><span>: Use moisturisers or emollients on the scalp to soften scales and reduce itching and flaking. Look for scalp-specific moisturisers or those containing ingredients such as salicylic acid, urea, or lactic acid to help exfoliate dead skin cells. Consider using natural oils like coconut oil, jojoba oil, or olive oil to hydrate and soothe your scalp. Apply a few drops of oil to the scalp, massage gently, and leave on for several hours or overnight before rinsing off.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid Scratching or Picking</b><span>: Resist the urge to scratch or pick at scalp psoriasis lesions, as this can worsen inflammation, lead to bleeding or infection, and potentially cause hair loss. Instead, gently massage the scalp or use a soft-bristled brush to loosen scales and improve circulation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Manage Stress</b><span>: Stress can worsen psoriasis symptoms and cause flare-ups. Use stress-reduction techniques like mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or tai chi to help manage stress and promote relaxation. Spending time with loved ones, listening to music, reading, or going for a walk in nature are all relaxing activities.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Maintain a Healthy Diet</b><span>: While there is limited scientific evidence linking specific foods to psoriasis flare-ups, eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats can help with overall health and well-being. Some people with psoriasis may find that certain foods or dietary triggers worsen their symptoms. Pay attention to how your body reacts to various foods, and consider keeping a food diary to identify potential triggers.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Stay Hydrated</b><span>: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated and support skin health. Hydration is essential for maintaining the skin's natural moisture barrier and preventing dryness and flakiness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consult a Healthcare Professional</b><span>: If over-the-counter treatments and lifestyle changes do not provide adequate relief, see a dermatologist or other healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and treatment recommendations. They may prescribe topical or oral medications, phototherapy, or biologic therapies to help manage scalp psoriasis and reduce flare-ups.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><span>Dandruff is a skin condition that primarily affects the scalp. It is distinguished by the shedding of dead skin cells from the scalp as white, flaky, and occasionally itchy scales. While dandruff is not a life-threatening condition, it is unsightly and uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span>The exact cause of</span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/anti-dandruff"> </a><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/anti-dandruff"><b>dandruff</b></a><span> is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of factors such as an overgrowth of a yeast-like fungus called</span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/malassezia-biofilm-what-it-is-and-how-to-treat-it"> </a><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/malassezia-biofilm-what-it-is-and-how-to-treat-it"><b>Malassezia</b></a><span>,</span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/seborrheic-dermatitis"> </a><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/seborrheic-dermatitis"><b>seborrheic dermatitis</b></a><span> (a type of skin inflammation),</span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/dry-skin"> </a><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/dry-skin"><b>dry skin</b></a><span>, and sensitivity to hair products. Stress, hormonal changes, and certain medical conditions can also contribute to dandruff.</span></p>
<p><span>Dandruff is typically treated with over-the-counter shampoos containing zinc pyrithione,</span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/salicylic-range"> </a><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/salicylic-range"><b>salicylic acid</b></a><span>,</span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/ketoconazole-shampoo-what-you-need-to-know"> </a><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/ketoconazole-shampoo-what-you-need-to-know"><b>ketoconazole</b></a><span>, or selenium sulphide. In more severe cases, prescription-strength shampoos or other treatments may be necessary.</span></p>
<h3><b>Causes of Dandruff</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Causes of Dandruff" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Causes_of_Dandruff_480x480.jpg?v=1720161726"/></div>
<p><span>Dandruff is a common scalp condition that causes flakes of dead skin to appear in the hair and on clothing. The exact cause of dandruff is unknown, but some factors that may contribute include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Yeast overgrowth</b><span>: An overgrowth of the yeast Malassezia on the scalp can cause dandruff. This yeast is normally present on the scalp, but if it grows too much, it can irritate the skin and cause flaking.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Dry skin</b><span>:</span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/dry-scalp"> </a><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/dry-scalp"><b>Dry skin</b></a><span> on the scalp can lead to dandruff. This is more common in the winter months when the air is dry and cold.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Seborrheic dermatitis</b><span>: Seborrheic dermatitis is a condition that causes red, itchy, and scaly patches on the skin. It can occur on the scalp and cause dandruff.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Oily skin</b><span>: People with</span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/oily-scalp"> </a><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/oily-scalp"><b>oily skin</b></a><span> are more likely to develop dandruff. This is because the excess oil on the scalp can promote the growth of yeast and bacteria.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Certain skin conditions</b><span>: People with psoriasis,</span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/eczema"> </a><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/eczema"><b>eczema</b></a><span>, and other skin conditions may be more prone to dandruff.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Stress</b><span>: Stress can weaken the immune system and make the scalp more susceptible to dandruff.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Poor hygiene</b><span>: Not washing the hair often enough can lead to a build-up of dead skin cells, oil, and other debris on the scalp, which can cause dandruff.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>It is important to note that, contrary to popular belief, dandruff is not caused by poor hygiene. Regular hair washing with a mild shampoo can aid in the prevention and management of dandruff.</span></p>

<h3><b>Preventing Dandruff: Daily Care Tips</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Preventing Dandruff: Daily Care Tips" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Preventing_Dandruff__Daily_Care_Tips_480x480.jpg?v=1720161839"/></div>
<p><span>Maintaining a healthy scalp and reducing factors that can contribute to dandruff development are key to preventing it. Here are some daily care tips to help avoid dandruff:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Regular Hair Washing</b><span>: Use a gentle shampoo to remove excess oil, dirt, and dead skin cells from the scalp.  Aim to wash your hair every other day, or as needed, depending on your hair type and lifestyle.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use Anti-Dandruff Shampoo</b><span>: If you have dandruff, use a shampoo that contains zinc pyrithione, selenium sulphide, ketoconazole, or coal tar.  These ingredients help control yeast, which can cause dandruff, and soothe an irritated scalp.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Massage Your Scalp</b><span>: While shampooing, gently massage your scalp with your fingertips to help loosen flakes and improve circulation.  Avoid using your fingernails because they can damage the scalp and aggravate dandruff.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Rinse Thoroughly</b><span>: After shampooing, thoroughly rinse your hair and scalp to remove any remaining shampoo and conditioner.  Residue on the scalp can lead to dandruff and irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Minimise Styling Products</b><span>: Since gels, mousses, and hairsprays can accumulate on the scalp and exacerbate dandruff, cut back on your use of these products.  If you use styling products, stay away from applying them straight to the scalp and instead use light, water-based formulas.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Steer clear of hot water</b><span>: Hot water can strip the scalp of its natural oils and cause dryness and flakiness. Instead, wash your hair with lukewarm or cool water.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Maintain a Healthy Diet</b><span>: To promote general scalp health, eat a balanced diet full of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.  Omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, and B vitamins are especially helpful in maintaining a healthy scalp.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Manage Stress</b><span>: Stress can aggravate dandruff and other scalp issues.  Meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga can all help you manage stress and promote scalp health.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Protect Your Scalp</b><span>: Shield your scalp from harsh environmental factors such as extreme cold, wind, and sun.  Wear a hat or scarf when outdoors to shield your scalp from the elements.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consult a Dermatologist</b><span>: If you're still having trouble controlling dandruff after following these tips, or if your scalp becomes red, inflamed, or painful, see a dermatologist for a more thorough evaluation and treatment recommendations.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>By following these daily care tips, you can prevent dandruff and keep your scalp healthy and flake-free.</span></p>
<h2><b>Differentiating Between Scalp Psoriasis and Dandruff</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Differentiating Between Scalp Psoriasis and Dandruff" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Differentiating_Between_Scalp_Psoriasis_and_Dandruff_480x480.jpg?v=1720162310"/></div>
<p><span>Scalp psoriasis and dandruff both cause flaking and itching of the scalp, but they have distinct underlying causes and symptoms.  Here are some key differences to help you distinguish between scalp psoriasis and dandruff:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Cause</b><span>: Scalp psoriasis is an autoimmune condition characterised by rapid skin cell turnover, resulting in the formation of thick, silvery scales and red, inflamed patches of scalp. It is caused by an overactive immune response, which results in inflammation and abnormal skin cell growth. Dandruff, also known as seborrhoeic dermatitis, is a common scalp condition marked by flaking of the skin, which is frequently accompanied by itching and redness. Its exact cause is unknown, but yeast overgrowth (Malassezia), excessive oil production, and sensitivity to certain hair care products may all play a role.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Appearance</b><span>: Scalp psoriasis usually manifests as thick, silvery-white scales on the scalp, which may be accompanied by red, inflamed patches of skin. These scales may extend from the hairline to the forehead, neck, or behind the ears. Dandruff typically appears as small, white or yellowish flakes of skin that are greasy or oily in appearance. It is more localised to the scalp and does not usually cause inflammation or thick scaling.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Itching</b><span>: Scalp psoriasis can cause severe itching and discomfort, particularly when the scales crack or bleeding.  Dandruff can cause mild to moderate scalp itching, but it is typically less severe than the itching associated with scalp psoriasis.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Location</b><span>: Scalp psoriasis can affect the entire scalp or specific areas of the scalp, and it may spread to other parts of the body, such as the forehead, neck, or ears.  Dandruff usually only affects the scalp and does not spread to other parts of the body.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Chronicity</b><span>: Scalp psoriasis is a chronic, long-term condition that may flare up on occasion and necessitates ongoing management to keep symptoms under control.  Dandruff may come and go, but it is often treatable with regular shampooing and proper scalp care.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>If you are unsure whether you have scalp psoriasis or dandruff, or if you are experiencing persistent scalp symptoms despite using over-the-counter treatments, you should see a dermatologist for an accurate diagnosis and treatment options.  A dermatologist can perform a physical examination and, if necessary, may recommend additional tests or procedures to confirm the diagnosis and develop an effective treatment plan tailored to your needs.</span></p>
<h3><b>Key Differences in Appearance</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Key Differences in Appearance" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Key_Differences_in_Appearance_480x480.jpg?v=1720162349"/></div>
<p><span>The appearance of scalp psoriasis and dandruff can vary in several ways:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Scalp Psoriasis</b><span>:</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Scalp psoriasis is often characterised by thick, silvery-white scales on the scalp. These scales can be larger and more adherent than the smaller flakes found in dandruff.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Scalp psoriasis scales are typically accompanied by red, inflamed skin patches on the scalp. The redness may be more visible around the scales and extend beyond the affected areas.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Scalp psoriasis scales vary in thickness, but they are generally thicker and more prominent than dandruff flakes.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><b>Dandruff</b><span>:</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Dandruff usually appears as small, white or yellowish flakes of skin on the scalp. These flakes are typically smaller and more loosely attached than scalp psoriasis scales. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Dandruff flakes may appear greasy or oily, particularly if the scalp produces an excessive amount of sebum (natural oil). However, depending on the individual, they can be dry or powdery.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>While dandruff can cause mild redness or irritation on the scalp, it is usually less noticeable than the red, inflamed patches associated with scalp psoriasis.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Scalp Psoriasis</b><span>:</span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><span>In severe cases, scalp psoriasis can cause temporary hair loss due to inflammation and scratching that damages the hair follicles. However, hair loss is not a common symptom of scalp psoriasis in most people.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The thick, adherent scales of scalp psoriasis can accumulate on the scalp, causing discomfort, itching, and possible hair matting. This buildup may also interfere with healthy hair growth and scalp hygiene.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Scalp psoriasis can cause severe irritation, redness, and inflammation, exacerbating existing scalp conditions and affecting hair health. Itching and scratching can damage the scalp and cause secondary infections.</span></p>

<p><span>Dandruff can cause scalp itching and irritation, which can result in scratching and damage to the scalp and hair follicles. Persistent scratching can also cause inflammation and exacerbate existing scalp conditions.</span></p>

<p><span>Dandruff can occur in people with dry or oily scalps. In some cases, dandruff is accompanied by scalp dryness and flakiness, whereas in others, it is associated with excessive oiliness and sebum production.</span></p>

<p><span>While dandruff does not usually cause hair loss, the presence of visible flakes on the scalp can alter the appearance of the hair, making it appear dull, dirty, or unkempt. This can affect one's self-esteem and confidence. </span></p>

</ul>
</ol>
<p><span>In both cases, treating the underlying scalp condition is critical to improving hair and scalp health. This could include using medicated shampoos or treatments to control symptoms, sticking to a regular cleansing and moisturizing routine, and avoiding harsh hair care practices that can aggravate scalp irritation. A dermatologist or healthcare professional can make personalised recommendations for managing scalp psoriasis, dandruff, and other scalp conditions while minimising their impact on hair health.</span></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion: Scalp Psoriasis vs. Dandruff</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Conclusion: Scalp Psoriasis vs. Dandruff" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Conclusion__Scalp_Psoriasis_vs._Dandruff_480x480.jpg?v=1720162429"/></div>
<p><span>Psoriasis of the scalp and dandruff are two common scalp conditions. While both conditions can cause flaking and itching, the underlying causes and treatments are different.</span></p>
<p><span>Dandruff is a mild form of seborrheic dermatitis, a common inflammatory skin condition affecting the scalp, face, and other parts of the body. It is frequently caused by an overgrowth of a yeast called Malassezia, which can result in excessive skin cell shedding. Dandruff is typically treated with over-the-counter medicated shampoos containing zinc pyrithione, coal tar, or salicylic acid.</span></p>
<p><span>Scalp psoriasis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disorder in which skin cells grow abnormally quickly, resulting in thick, scaly patches on the scalp. Scalp psoriasis can cause redness and inflammation in addition to flaking and itching. Topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, and tar-based products are among the treatments available for scalp psoriasis. In severe cases, systemic treatments such as oral medications or biologics may be required.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are experiencing scalp flaking and itching, it is important to see a healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan.</span></p>
