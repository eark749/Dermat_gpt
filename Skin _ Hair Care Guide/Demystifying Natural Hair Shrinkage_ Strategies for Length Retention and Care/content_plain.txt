Natural hair shrinking is a common occurrence in people with curly or kinky hair textures. It occurs when the hair strands coil or curl tightly, making the hair appear shorter than it actually is. While shrinking might be irritating for some people, it is a natural feature of curly hair that can be controlled with the appropriate techniques. In this blog, we'll look at some techniques for keeping length and caring for natural hair that shrinks.
Understanding Shrinkage: The Science Behind Curly Hair's Elasticity
Shrinkage is a frequent feature of curly or kinky hair textures, and it is caused by the unique structure of the hair strand. To understand the science of shrinkage, it's necessary to investigate the anatomy and behaviour of curly hair, including hair structure, bonding and water absorption, elasticity and contraction, curl pattern, environmental influences, and hair care techniques.
Identifying Factors That Influence Hair Shrinkage
Several causes contribute to hair shrinkage, particularly in those with curly or kinky hair textures. Understanding these variables might help people better control loss and accept their unique hair structure. Hair texture, porosity, environmental humidity, water absorption, hair care practice, product usage, and hair length are all important factors in determining
hair loss
.
The Role of Hair Porosity in Shrinkage Dynamics
Hair porosity influences the dynamics of hair shrinkage, especially in people with curly or kinky hair textures. Hair porosity, or the hair's ability to absorb and retain moisture, is determined by the structure of the hair cuticle, which is the outermost covering of the hair shaft. Here's how hair porosity influences shrinking dynamics:
Low Porosity Hair
: Low porosity hair has a tightly closed cuticle layer, making it less susceptible to moisture absorption. As a result, low-porosity hair shrinks less when exposed to moisture. The tightly closed cuticle layer serves as a barrier, keeping moisture from entering the hair shaft and causing it to swell dramatically. While low-porosity hair may undergo some loss, it is typically less noticeable than greater-porosity hair types.
High Porosity Hair
: High porosity hair has a more open cuticle layer, allowing moisture to easily enter the hair shaft. As a result, high-porosity hair absorbs more moisture and expands more when exposed to water or humidity. This increased moisture absorption might cause more substantial shrinkage as the hair strands stretch and lengthen. Additionally, high-porosity hair may lose moisture more quickly as it dries, causing the curls to constrict and shrink even more.
Moisture Retention
: The ability of the hair to retain moisture also influences the shrinkage process. Hair with low porosity has improved moisture retention due to its tightly closed cuticle layer, which helps seal in moisture and prevent it from evaporating too quickly. Low-porosity hair may have less loss over time because moisture is kept within the hair shaft. In contrast, high-porosity hair may struggle to retain moisture, resulting in faster drying and shrinking as it loses moisture.
Product Absorption
: Hair porosity influences the hair's capacity to absorb items such as moisturisers,
conditioners,
and styling products. Low porosity hair may have difficulties absorbing products because of its firmly closed cuticle layer, resulting in product buildup and ineffective moisturization. High porosity hair, on the other hand, absorbs products quickly but may require more frequent moisturization to avoid dryness and shrinking.
Shrinkage Variability
: Individuals with varied hair porosities and textures may have varying degrees of shrinkage. While low-porosity hair shrinks less overall, individual differences in hair density, curl pattern, and environmental factors can all affect shrinking dynamics. Furthermore, hair porosity can change over time as a result of heat style, chemical treatments, and environmental degradation, which influences shrinkage variability.
How Hair Texture Affects Shrinkage Patterns
Individuals with curly or kinky hair experience significantly different shrinkage patterns and degrees, depending on their hair texture. Hair texture describes the diameter or width of individual hair strands, as well as the shape and arrangement of curls or coils.  Here's how various hair textures influence shrinkage patterns:
Fine hair strands have a smaller diameter and are more delicate and fragile than coarser hair textures
. Fine hair
exhibits less pronounced shrinkage than coarser textures because the hair strands are less densely packed and have less bulk to shrink. However, fine hair may experience shrinkage, especially in areas with tighter curl patterns or higher porosity.
In terms of diameter and density, medium hair texture is somewhere between fine and coarse. Medium-textured hair may experience moderate shrinkage, depending on curl pattern, porosity, and moisture levels. Individuals with medium-textured hair may notice varying shrinkage patterns throughout their hair, with some areas shrinking more than others depending on curl type and porosity.
Coarse hair strands have a larger diameter, making them thicker and stronger than finer textures. Coarse hair has more noticeable shrinkage because it is thicker and denser, allowing for greater curl formation and tighter coils. Coarse hair can shrink significantly when exposed to water or moisture, especially in areas with tighter curl patterns or higher porosity.
The natural curl pattern of the hair influences shrinkage patterns. Hair with tighter curl patterns, such as Type 4 coils, exhibits more shrinkage than hair with looser curl patterns, such as Type 2 waves or Type 3 curls. Tighter curls have more defined spirals and coils, which are more likely to contract and shrink when exposed to moisture.
Hair porosity, or the hair's ability to absorb and retain moisture, can influence shrinkage patterns. Hair with higher porosity absorbs more moisture and swells more when exposed to water or humidity, resulting in greater shrinkage.  Lower porosity hair, on the other hand, may shrink less due to its ability to resist moisture absorption and retain shape.
The length of the hair can also affect shrinkage patterns. Longer hair may appear to shrink less overall because the weight of the hair pulls the curls down and spreads them. Shorter hair may experience more noticeable shrinkage because the curls have less weight to pull them down and can contract more tightly.
Taming the Shrink: Top 8 Methods to Combat Natural Hair Shrinkage
Taming natural hair shrinkage can be difficult, but there are several techniques that people with curly or kinky hair textures can use to reduce shrinkage and stretch out their curls. Here are the top eight methods for preventing natural hair shrinkage:
Twist or Braid Outs
: Twistouts and braid outs are popular styling techniques for stretching out natural curls and reducing shrinkage. After washing and conditioning your hair, twist or braid small sections of damp hair and let them air dry, or use a diffuser to speed up the process. Once dry, undo the twists or braids to reveal long, defined curls.
Banding Method
: The banding method uses elastic bands or hair ties to stretch out the hair and reduce shrinkage. Divide damp hair into sections and wrap small elastic bands or hair ties around the length of each, spacing them evenly apart. Leave the bands on the hair until it is completely dry, then remove them to reveal stretched-out curls.
Blow Drying with a Diffuser
: Using a diffuser attachment to dry your hair can help stretch out curls and reduce shrinkage while minimising heat damage. Use a low or medium heat setting and gently scrunch the hair with the diffuser to promote curl definition and elongation. Finish with a cool shot of air to set the style and
minimise frizz
.
African Threading
: African threading is a traditional hair stretching technique in which thread or yarn is tightly wrapped around sections of damp hair. As the hair dries, the tension from the threading process elongates the curls and reduces shrinkage. After drying, carefully unravel the thread to reveal the stretched-out curls.
Pineappling
: Pineappling is a nighttime styling technique in which the hair is pulled into a loose, high ponytail at the crown of the head and secured with a satin scrunchie or hair tie. This helps to maintain curl definition and prevents flattening or squishing of the curls while sleeping, resulting in less shrinkage the following day.
Stretching Products
: Use curl creams, leave-in conditioners, or styling gels designed to elongate curls and reduce shrinkage. Apply the product to damp hair and use your fingers or a wide-tooth comb to gently stretch out the curls while styling.
Tension Method
: The tension method involves gently pulling and stretching sections of damp hair while styling to promote elongation and minimise shrinkage. Smooth and stretch out the curls with your fingers or a wide-tooth comb while applying styling products or manipulating the hair into the desired style.
Heatless Hair Stretching Tools
: Heatless hair stretching tools, such as hair rollers, flexi-rods, and curlformers, can be used to stretch curls and reduce shrinkage without using heat. Wrap sections of damp hair around the rollers or rods, then air dry or sleep with them overnight for maximum stretch.
By incorporating these techniques into your
hair care
routine, you can effectively combat natural hair shrinkage and achieve longer, more defined curls with less shrinkage. Experiment with different techniques to see what works best for your hair texture and desired style, and remember that moisture and hydration are essential for healthy, vibrant curls.
Hydration as the Key to Minimizing Shrinkage
Hydration is an important factor in reducing shrinkage in people with curly or kinky hair textures. Well-hydrated hair is more elastic and pliable, making it less likely to shrink when exposed to water or moisture. Here's why hydration is essential for reducing shrinkage and how to maintain optimal hydration levels in curly or kinky hair:
Moisture Retention
: Hydrated hair retains moisture more effectively, reducing swelling and shrinkage when exposed to water or humidity. Moisturized hair is less likely to become dry and brittle, lowering the risk of breakage and
damage
caused by shrinkage.
Enhanced Elasticity
: Proper hydration improves hair elasticity, allowing it to stretch and expand more freely without breaking or becoming damaged. Well-hydrated curls are more resilient and can withstand shrinkage while maintaining their shape and definition.
Curl Definition
: Hydrated hair has more defined curls and coils because the moisture allows the hair strands to clump together and form well-defined curl patterns. Curls that are well-defined are less likely to drastically shrink and become unmanageable when exposed to moisture or water.
Reduced Frizz and Dryness
: Hair that has been hydrated is silkier and less likely to frizz and dryness, which can worsen shrinkage and give the impression that the hair is shorter than it is. Proper hydration helps to seal the hair cuticle and smooth the hair surface, reducing frizz and increasing shine and manageability.
Hydration Tips for Curly or Kinky Hair
: Use hydrating and moisturising hair care products designed specifically for curly or kinky hair textures, such as leave-in conditioners, moisturising creams, and
hair oils
. Look for products that contain humectants like glycerin or hyaluronic acid, which attract moisture to the hair and help it stay there. Deep conditioning your hair on a regular basis helps to replenish moisture and nourish the strands. Select emollient- and moisturizing-rich deep conditioning treatments to leave your hair feeling hydrated and supple. To optimise moisture retention, incorporate the LOC (Liquid, Oil, Cream) or LCO (Liquid, Cream, Oil) method into your hair care regimen. Start by spritzing damp hair with a hydrating mist or water-based leave-in conditioner. Next, apply a sealing oil or
serum
. Lastly, seal in moisture with a moisturising cream or styling product. To protect and retain moisture in your hair while sleeping, use a satin or silk pillowcase or hair bonnet. Cotton pillowcases can absorb moisture from the hair, causing dryness and frizz, which leads to increased shrinkage. Hydrate your body from within by drinking plenty of water and eating a well-balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Proper hydration and nutrition promote overall hair health and hydration, reducing shrinkage and preserving vibrant, healthy curls.
By prioritising hydration and incorporating moisture-rich products and techniques into your hair care routine, you can reduce shrinkage and maintain healthy, hydrated curls and coils. Experiment with different hydration methods to see what works best for your hair texture and needs. Remember to listen to your hair and adjust your routine as needed to keep it hydrated and nourished.
Protective Styling Solutions to Prevent Excessive Shrinkage
Individuals with curly or kinky hair textures can benefit from protective styling to reduce shrinkage and damage. These styles help to hide hair ends, reduce manipulation, and protect the hair from environmental stressors that can cause shrinkage. Braids, twists, bantu knots, protective updos, wigs or extensions, halo or crown braids, low manipulation styles, satin or silk scarves, and pre-stretching techniques are some protective styling options for preventing excessive shrinkage. By incorporating these protective styling solutions into your hair care routine, you can effectively avoid excessive shrinkage while also maintaining the health and integrity of your curly or kinky hair. Experiment with different styles and techniques to see what works best for your hair texture, length, and lifestyle, and always prioritise moisture and hydration to keep your hair nourished and protected.

masks
can help improve hair elasticity by nourishing and strengthening the hair shaft, restoring moisture balance, and increasing flexibility. Here are some DIY treatments and masks to improve hair elasticity:
Avocado and Olive Oil Mask
:
Avocado is high in vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids, which nourish and strengthen the hair, whereas olive oil adds moisture and increases elasticity. Mash one ripe avocado and combine it with two tablespoons of olive oil. Apply the mixture to damp hair, concentrating on the mid-lengths and ends. Leave it on for 30-60 minutes, then thoroughly rinse with lukewarm water.
Banana and Honey Treatment
:
Bananas contain potassium, vitamins, and natural oils that moisturise and strengthen hair, whereas honey acts as a humectant, retaining moisture and improving elasticity. Mash one ripe banana and mix in two tablespoons of honey. Apply the mixture to damp hair, cover it with a shower cap or plastic wrap, and let it sit for 30 minutes. Rinse with lukewarm water thoroughly.
Egg and Yogurt Mask
:
Eggs are high in protein and essential nutrients that strengthen and elasticity, whereas yoghurt contains lactic acid and probiotics that nourish the scalp and hair follicles. Beat an egg and combine it with half a cup of plain yoghurt. Apply the mixture to damp hair, concentrating on the roots and the scalp. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes, then rinse with cool water and
shampoo
normally.
Coconut Milk and Aloe Vera Gel Treatment
:
Coconut milk is a natural moisturiser that moisturises and strengthens hair, whereas aloe vera gel soothes the scalp and increases hair flexibility. Combine half a cup of coconut milk and two tablespoons of fresh aloe vera gel. Apply the mixture to damp hair, massaging it into the scalp and distributing it throughout the lengths of hair. Leave it on for 30-60 minutes, then thoroughly rinse with lukewarm water.
Gelatin Hair Mask
:
Gelatin is a protein-rich substance that fortifies the hair shaft and increases suppleness. Dissolve one spoonful of unflavored gelatin in one cup of warm water until completely dissolved. Allow the mixture to cool briefly before applying it to damp hair, concentrating on the mid-lengths and ends. Leave it on for 15-20 minutes, then rinse with lukewarm water.
Apple Cider Vinegar Rinse
:
Apple cider vinegar restores the pH balance of the scalp and hair, improving suppleness and reducing breakage. Pour one part apple cider vinegar and three parts water over damp hair after shampooing. Let it stay for a few minutes before thoroughly rinsing it with cool water.
Yogurt and Fenugreek Seed Paste
:
Fenugreek seeds contain proteins and lecithin, which help to strengthen and elasticity hair, while yoghurt gives moisture and nourishment. Soak two teaspoons of fenugreek seeds in water overnight, then crush them to a paste. Combine the paste with half a cup of plain yoghurt and apply to damp hair. Leave it on for 30-60 minutes, then thoroughly rinse with lukewarm water.
Honey and Coconut Oil Treatment

Combine equal parts honey and melted coconut oil and apply to damp hair, concentrating on the mid-lengths and ends. Leave it on for 30-60 minutes, then thoroughly rinse with lukewarm water.
The Importance of Regular Trims in Preventing Shrinkage
Regular trims are essential for preventing shrinkage and keeping curly or kinky hair healthy and looking good. Trimming the hair to prevent shrinkage may seem counterintuitive, but it removes damaged and split ends, which can improve overall hair health and reduce shrinkage. Here's why regular trims are essential for preventing shrinkage:
Split ends are a common problem for people with curly or kinky hair because the scalp's natural oils have a difficult time travelling down the length of the hair shaft. Split ends happen when the protective outer layer of the hair cuticle is damaged or frayed, causing the hair to break into two or more strands. These split ends can cause additional breakage and damage, accelerating shrinkage and preventing the hair from reaching its full potential length.
Split ends weaken the hair shaft and increase its susceptibility to breakage, especially in areas where the hair is subjected to friction or tension, such as the ends of braids or twists. Regular trims help to remove split ends and prevent breakage, allowing the hair to retain its length and elasticity while minimising shrinkage.
Regularly trimming split ends promotes healthy hair growth by preventing damage from travelling up the hair shaft and causing additional breakage. Trims allow the hair to grow longer and stronger by preserving the integrity of the hair shaft, requiring fewer obstacles in the form of shrinkage and breakage.
Regular trims help curly or kinky hairstyles keep their shape and definition by removing uneven or ragged ends that can disrupt the natural curl pattern.  Trimming the hair regularly ensures that the curls are uniform in length and appearance, which allows for more consistent styling and less shrinkage overall.
Split ends can lead to tangling and knotting, especially in curly or kinky hair textures where the hair strands intertwine and wrap around one another. Trimming hair regularly helps to prevent tangling and knotting by removing damaged ends that can catch and snag on adjacent strands, lowering the risk of breakage and shrinkage.
Regular trims help to improve overall hair health by removing damaged and weakened hair and encouraging the growth of stronger, more resilient strands. Healthy hair can withstand environmental stressors, styling techniques, and manipulation, resulting in less shrinkage and breakage over time.
Tailored Regimens for Different Curl Types and Porosity Levels
Tailoring hair care regimens to different curl types and porosity levels is critical for addressing each hair type's unique needs and achieving optimal moisture retention, curl definition, and overall hair health. Here's how you can tailor your hair care regimen to different curl types and porosity levels:
Hair Type Classification
:
Type 2 (Wavy Hair)
: Wavy hair typically has a fine to medium texture and can range from loose S-shaped waves to more defined curls. Wavy hair can benefit from lightweight, volumizing products that add curl definition without weighing it down. Look for gentle, sulfate-free shampoos and lightweight conditioners that add moisture without causing buildup. To define and enhance the natural wave pattern, apply curl-enhancing mousses or creams, then finish with a light-hold hairspray or gel to maintain volume and shape.
Type 3 (Curly Hair)
: Curly hair features well-defined curls that range from loose spiral curls to tight corkscrew curls. Curly hair often has a medium to coarse texture and may require extra moisture and hydration to retain curl definition and reduce frizz. Use hydrating shampoos and conditioners to add moisture and nourishment to your hair, and consider using leave-in conditioners or curl creams to improve moisture retention and define curls. Apply style products like gels or custards to damp hair to help set the curl pattern and eliminate frizz, and while blow drying, use a diffuser attachment to improve curl definition and volume.
Type 4 (Kinky-Coily Hair)
: Kinky-coily hair is distinguished by tightly coiled or zigzag curls that vary in size from small coils to larger, springy curls. Type 4 hair has a coarse texture and may have higher porosity levels, necessitating adequate moisture and hydration to maintain elasticity and avoid breaking. Use moisturising shampoos and deep conditioners that penetrate the hair shaft and provide long-lasting moisture, and think about using pre-poo or hot oil treatments to nourish and strengthen your hair. Thick, creamy styling products, such as butter or puddings, can help seal in moisture and define curls. Protective styling techniques, such as twists or braids, can help reduce manipulation and breaking.
2. Porosity Level Consideration
:
Low Porosity Hair
:
Low porosity hair has a tightly closed cuticle layer that repels moisture, making it difficult for water and products to enter the hair shaft. Low porosity hair benefits from lightweight, water-based products that are easy to absorb and do not cause buildup. Use clarifying shampoos or apple cider vinegar rinses to remove product buildup and open the hair cuticle, then apply lightweight, moisturising conditioners that can penetrate the hair shaft. To improve moisture retention, apply leave-in conditioners or hydrating mists to damp hair. Steam treatments or hooded dryers can also help open the hair cuticle and improve product absorption.
Medium Porosity Hair
: Medium porosity hair has a balanced cuticle layer that easily absorbs and retains moisture, making it relatively simple to maintain. Medium porosity hair benefits from a well-balanced hair care regimen that prioritises moisture retention while preventing dryness and breakage. Use gentle, sulfate-free shampoos and moisturising conditioners that hydrate without weighing down the hair, and consider adding protein treatments or deep conditioning masks to strengthen and nourish it. Apply styling products like creams or gels to damp hair to improve curl definition and reduce frizz, and when blow drying, use a diffuser attachment to add volume and bounce.
High Porosity Hair
: High porosity hair has a raised cuticle layer that readily absorbs moisture but struggles to retain it, resulting in dryness, frizz, and breakage. High porosity hair benefits from rich, emollient products that help seal in moisture and strengthen the shaft. Use creamy, moisturising shampoos and conditioners that provide intense hydration and nourishment to your hair. Consider using leave-in conditioners or hair oils to help seal the cuticle and lock in moisture. Apply styling products like creams or butters to damp hair to help define curls and reduce frizz, and think about using protective styling techniques like twists or braids to minimise manipulation and breakage.
By tailoring hair care regimens to different curl types and porosity levels, you can address your hair's specific needs and achieve optimal moisture retention, curl definition, and overall hair health. Experiment with various products and techniques to see what works best for your hair's texture and porosity level, and remember to listen to your hair and adjust your regimen as needed to keep it healthy and vibrant.
