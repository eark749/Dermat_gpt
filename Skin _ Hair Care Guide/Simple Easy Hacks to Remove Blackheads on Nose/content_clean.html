<h2><strong>What Causes Blackheads on Nose</strong></h2>

<p><span>Blackheads, also known as open comedones, occur when hair follicles become clogged with excess oil, dead skin cells, and dirt. Several factors contribute to the formation of blackheads on the nose:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong> Excess Sebum Production:</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>The sebaceous glands in the skin produce oil (sebum) to keep it moisturised. However, excessive sebum production can lead to <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/acne-acne-scars">clogged pores</a>, increasing the likelihood of blackheads.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong> Dead Skin Cells:</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>The skin naturally sheds dead skin cells, but if they are not effectively removed, they can accumulate and mix with sebum, leading to blackhead formation.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong> Hormonal Changes:</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/period-acne-treatment">Hormonal fluctuations</a>, particularly during puberty, can stimulate increased sebum production, making teenagers more prone to blackheads.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong> Cosmetics and Skincare Products:</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Certain cosmetic products, especially those that are heavy and pore-clogging, can contribute to the development of blackheads.</span></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong> Cleanse Your Face:</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Start by washing your face with a gentle cleanser to remove any dirt, oil, and makeup. Use lukewarm water, as hot water can strip the skin of its natural oils.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong> Exfoliate Regularly:</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Regular exfoliation helps remove dead skin cells and unclog pores, reducing the occurrence of blackheads. Opt for <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/a-beginners-guide-to-skin-care-acids-understanding-the-basics">chemical exfoliants</a> containing salicylic acid or glycolic acid, which penetrate the pores and dissolve impurities.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong> Steam Your Face:</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Steaming your face helps open up the pores, making it easier to remove blackheads. Fill a bowl with hot water, place your face over it, and cover your head with a towel to trap the steam. Steam for about 5-10 minutes, then pat your face dry.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong> Use a Blackhead Extractor Tool:</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Gently press the blackhead extractor tool against the blackhead and apply light pressure to extract it. Ensure that you sanitise the tool before and after each use to avoid spreading bacteria.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong> Apply a Clay Mask:</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Clay masks, particularly those containing kaolin or bentonite clay, can draw out impurities and absorb excess oil. Apply a thin layer of the mask to your nose, let it dry, and rinse it off with lukewarm water.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong> Moisturise:</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>After removing blackheads, it's important to moisturise your skin. Choose a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/non-comedogenic-skincare-products">non-comedogenic </a>moisturiser that won't clog your pores and will keep your skin hydrated.</span></p>
