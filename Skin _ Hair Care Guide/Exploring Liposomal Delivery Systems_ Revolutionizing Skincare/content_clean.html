<p><span>Liposomes are small, rounded spheres. They're very trendy in the skincare industry, and many prefer them since they include active chemicals. Phospholipids, which are similar to our skin's natural makeup, form a key component that can store both water- and fat-loving molecules. When it comes to liposome formation, some molecules play critical roles. These fascinating molecules feature water-like and non-water-like ends, similar to how oil does not mix with water but can float in it if shaken. The water-loving and water-hating character of these molecules allows them to form double layers when in contact with water. This results in the formation of tiny balls, primarily composed of phospholipids synthesised in a laboratory or other fat-loving compounds, with a water-loving nugget inside.</span></p>
