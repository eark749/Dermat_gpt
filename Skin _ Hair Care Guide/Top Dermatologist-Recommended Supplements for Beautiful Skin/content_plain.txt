Gut Health
:
Probiotics help to restore and maintain a healthy balance of beneficial bacteria in the gut, which is required for proper digestion, nutrient absorption, and immune function. They compete with harmful bacteria for nutrients and space, preventing the overgrowth of pathogenic microorganisms that can harm gut health.
Probiotics can help relieve digestive symptoms like bloating, gas, constipation, and diarrhoea by encouraging regular bowel movements, reducing inflammation, and restoring gut barrier function. They may also help with the symptoms of IBS, IBD, and other gastrointestinal disorders.
The gut contains a significant portion of the body's immune system, and probiotics play an important role in regulating immune responses and protecting against infections. Probiotics increase the production of immunoglobulins, cytokines, and other immune factors, thereby strengthening the body's natural defence mechanisms.
Skin Clarity
:
Imbalances in gut microbiota and dysregulation of the immune system can contribute to systemic inflammation, which is associated with skin conditions such as acne, eczema, and rosacea. Probiotics help modulate immune responses and reduce inflammation, which may help alleviate symptoms of inflammatory skin conditions and promote clearer skin.
The gut-skin axis refers to the bidirectional communication between the gut and the skin, where imbalances in gut microbiota can affect skin health and vice versa. Probiotics support gut barrier function, which may indirectly influence skin barrier function by reducing intestinal permeability and systemic inflammation. A healthy gut barrier helps prevent the translocation of harmful toxins and pathogens from the gut into the bloodstream, which can contribute to skin inflammation and breakouts.
Probiotics may also directly influence the composition and diversity of the skin microbiota, which plays a role in maintaining skin health and preventing colonization by pathogenic bacteria. By promoting a healthy balance of skin microorganisms, probiotics may help reduce the risk of skin infections and improve skin clarity.
