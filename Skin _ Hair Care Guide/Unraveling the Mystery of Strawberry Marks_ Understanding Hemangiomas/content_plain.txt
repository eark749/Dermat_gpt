As a new parent, there are a multitude of health concerns to be aware of when it comes to your child. From vaccinations to developmental milestones, it can be overwhelming to navigate the many different aspects of your child's health. One condition that you may encounter is a hemangioma, also known as a vascular birthmark or strawberry mark. These marks can be alarming to parents who are seeing them for the first time, but it's important to understand that they are actually quite common and typically harmless.
Hemangiomas are a type of birthmark that are caused by abnormal growth of blood vessels in the skin. While they can appear anywhere on the body, they are most commonly found on the head and neck. In most cases, hemangiomas will appear shortly after birth or within the first few weeks of life, and they will continue to grow for several months before eventually shrinking and disappearing on their own.
However, in some cases, hemangiomas can cause complications, such as obstruction of the airways, vision problems, or bleeding. Additionally, some hemangiomas may be located in highly visible areas and may cause cosmetic concerns for parents and children alike. In these cases, medical intervention may be necessary to treat or remove the hemangioma.
In this blog, we will provide a comprehensive overview of hemangiomas, including their causes, types, diagnosis, growth patterns, and available treatment options. We will also discuss potential complications and offer tips for managing skincare and providing emotional support for children with hemangiomas. Finally, we will explore recent advances in hemangioma research and treatment, so that parents can stay informed about the latest developments in this area. By the end of this blog, you will have the information you need to understand and manage hemangiomas in your child.
Hemangiomas: An Overview
A hemangioma is a type of birthmark that is caused by an abnormal growth of blood vessels. They typically appear during the first few weeks of life and may continue to grow for several months. Hemangiomas are more common in girls than boys and tend to occur more frequently in premature infants or those with a low birth weight.
What Are Hemangiomas and Strawberry Marks?
Hemangiomas are a type of vascular birthmark that occur when the blood vessels in the skin grow abnormally. The term "strawberry mark" is often used to describe hemangiomas that are bright red and raised, resembling a strawberry. These marks may be flat or raised and can vary in size and shape. In most cases, hemangiomas do not cause any pain or discomfort to the child.
Types and Appearance of Hemangiomas
There are several different types of hemangiomas, including capillary hemangiomas, cavernous hemangiomas, and mixed hemangiomas. Capillary hemangiomas are the most common type and are typically bright red in color. Cavernous hemangiomas are larger and deeper, often appearing as a bluish-purple lump under the skin. Mixed hemangiomas contain both capillaries and caverns and can have a variety of appearances.
Hemangiomas may also be classified by their location on the body. Superficial hemangiomas occur on the surface of the skin, while deep hemangiomas are located beneath the skin. Compound hemangiomas are a combination of the two.
Diagnosing and Monitoring Hemangiomas
Hemangiomas are usually diagnosed by a paediatrician or dermatologist during a routine physical examination. If a hemangioma is suspected, the doctor may perform additional tests such as an ultrasound or MRI to determine the size and location of the mark.
Hemangioma Growth and Development
Hemangiomas typically grow rapidly during the first few months of life, and then begin to shrink and disappear over the next several years. The growth pattern of hemangiomas can vary, and some may continue to grow for up to 18 months before starting to shrink. In rare cases, hemangiomas may continue to grow beyond infancy and require medical treatment.
When to Consult a Pediatric Dermatologist
If you notice a hemangioma on your child's skin, it is important to consult with a
paediatric dermatologist
for evaluation. In some cases, hemangiomas may be associated with underlying medical conditions such as liver disease or bleeding disorders. Additionally, if a hemangioma is located near the eyes, nose, or mouth, it may require special monitoring or treatment to prevent complications.
Treatment Options for Hemangiomas
While many hemangiomas will eventually go away on their own, some may require medical treatment to prevent complications or improve appearance. Treatment options for hemangiomas include oral medications, topical treatments, laser therapy, surgical options, and natural regression.
Oral Medications for Hemangiomas
One of the most effective treatments for hemangiomas is a medication called propranolol. This medication works by reducing the blood flow to the hemangioma, which can help to shrink the mark and prevent complications. Propranolol is typically prescribed for hemangiomas that are causing functional or cosmetic problems, such as those located near the eyes, nose, or mouth.
Another medication that may be used to treat hemangiomas is timolol. This medication is typically administered as a topical gel or drops and works by constricting the blood vessels in the hemangioma. While timolol is not as effective as propranolol, it may be used for smaller hemangiomas that do not require oral medication.
Topical Treatments and Laser Therapy
Topical treatments such as corticosteroid creams or ointments may be used to help reduce inflammation and promote healing in hemangiomas. Laser therapy is another treatment option that can be used to remove or reduce the appearance of hemangiomas. Laser therapy works by targeting the blood vessels in the hemangioma, causing them to shrink and eventually disappear.
Surgical Options and Natural Regression
In some cases, surgical options such as excision or cryotherapy may be used to remove hemangiomas. However, surgery is typically reserved for cases where the hemangioma is causing significant functional or cosmetic problems, as it can leave a scar.
Many hemangiomas will eventually go away on their own, without the need for medical treatment. This process is known as natural regression and typically occurs over the course of several years. While natural regression can be unpredictable, it is estimated that about 50% of hemangiomas will resolve on their own by the age of 5.
Managing Complications and Skincare for Hemangiomas
While many hemangiomas do not cause any problems, there are some potential complications that parents should be aware of. Additionally, proper skincare can help to prevent complications and improve the appearance of the hemangioma.
Potential Hemangioma Complications
In rare cases, hemangiomas may cause complications such as ulceration, infection, bleeding, or vision problems. Ulceration can occur when the skin overlying the hemangioma breaks down, causing an open sore. This can be painful and increase the risk of infection. If a hemangioma is located near the eyes, it may cause vision problems or amblyopia (lazy eye) if left untreated.
Skincare Tips for Hemangiomas
Proper skincare can help to prevent complications and promote healing in hemangiomas. It is important to keep the skin clean and dry, and to avoid applying any irritants or abrasive materials to the hemangioma. Sun protection is also important, as hemangiomas can be more sensitive to the sun and may darken or become more prominent with exposure.
Parental Support and Emotional Wellbeing
Having a child with a hemangioma can be emotionally challenging for parents, especially if the mark is located in a highly visible area. It is important for parents to remember that hemangiomas are common and typically harmless, and that many will go away on their own over time.
Coping with a Child's Hemangioma
Parents may feel a range of emotions when their child is diagnosed with a hemangioma, including anxiety, guilt, or sadness. It is important to seek support from family, friends, or a professional counsellor if needed. Additionally, talking to other parents who have gone through similar experiences can be helpful.
Building a Support Network and Resources
There are many resources available for parents of children with hemangiomas, including support groups, online forums, and educational materials. It can be helpful to connect with other parents who have gone through similar experiences and to learn more about the condition from reliable sources.
Advances in Hemangioma Research and Treatment
Research into hemangiomas is ongoing, and there have been several recent advances in the understanding and treatment of these marks. One promising area of research is the use of propranolol as a preventative measure for high-risk hemangiomas, such as those located near the eyes or airways.
Another area of research is the development of new topical treatments and laser therapies that may be more effective than current options. Additionally, researchers are exploring the use of genetic testing to predict which hemangiomas may require treatment and which may regress on their own.
Overall, hemangiomas are a common type of birthmark that usually do not require medical treatment. However, in some cases, hemangiomas may cause complications or cosmetic concerns that warrant treatment. Parents should consult with a Pediatric dermatologist if they have any concerns about their child's hemangioma, and should also take steps to support their child's emotional well-being during this time. With proper care and treatment, most children with hemangiomas can lead happy and healthy lives.
