Hair loss is a typical component of the hair growth cycle, and some hair is shed every day. People can lose 50 to 100 hairs per day on average. This amount varies according to age, genetics, hormonal fluctuations, and overall health. If you're concerned about your hair loss, it's advisable to visit a healthcare professional who can assess your specific situation and offer suitable advice and treatment alternatives.
Understanding the Hair Growth and Shedding Cycle
Understanding the hair growth and shedding cycle can give you a better understanding of the natural process of hair restoration. The hair development cycle is divided into three stages: anagen, catagen, and telogen. It is vital to note that hair follicles' growth cycles are not synchronized. Because each hair follicle works independently, not all hairs will be in the same phase at the same time. This is why some hair shedding occurs on a daily basis. The typical rate of hair growth per month is roughly half an inch (1.25 cm), but this can vary between individuals. Genetics, age, overall health, hormonal changes, and lifestyle habits can all have an impact on the duration of each phase and the total hair growth cycle. Understanding the hair growth and shedding cycles can help to clear up any confusion about the natural process of hair renewal. However, if you have excessive hair shedding, noticeable thinning, or concerns about hair loss, it is best to consult a healthcare professional or dermatologist for a thorough evaluation and appropriate treatment.
The Phases of the Hair Growth Cycle
The hair growth cycle is divided into three stages: anagen, catagen, and telogen. These stages define the various stages of hair growth and shedding. Let's explore each phase in more detail:
Anagen Phase
: This is the hair follicle's active growth phase. The cells in the hair bulb divide fast during anagen, and the hair strand grows. How long the anagen phase lasts impacts how long the hair can grow. This phase normally lasts two to six years on the scalp, but it might vary based on genetic causes and individual traits. The rate of cell division and the duration of the anagen phase affect the length of the hair during this phase.
Catagen Phase
: The hair follicle enters the catagen phase after the anagen phase, which is a brief transitional period. The hair follicle shrinks during catagen, and the lowest half of the follicle adheres to the scalp. This is the final stage of active hair growth. The catagen stage lasts two to three weeks.
Telogen Phase
: After the catagen phase, the hair follicle enters the telogen phase, also known as the resting phase. During telogen, the hair follicle remains dormant. The old hair strand is held in place while new hair grows beneath it. Approximately 10-15% of hairs on the scalp are in the telogen phase at any given time. The duration of this phase is around two to three months.
How Much Hair Should You Expect to Shed?
It is typical to shed between 50 and 100 hairs every day, on average. This amount varies from person to person, and factors such as hair type, length, and growth cycle might influence the sense of hair loss. It's crucial to understand that not every hair loss is a cause for concern. The human scalp has 100,000 to 150,000 hair follicles, each of which acts individually and goes through its own growth cycle. This means that although some hairs are actively growing (anagen), others are resting (telogen) and are more likely to shed. Old hairs naturally shed during the telogen period to make way for new hair growth. These shedding hairs might be spotted on pillows, clothing, or while brushing or washing your hair. This shedding is a natural part of the hair growth cycle and should not be taken seriously. However, if you detect an increase in hair shedding, obvious thinning, or bald patches, you should see a healthcare expert or a dermatologist. They can assess your specific situation, order tests as needed, and advise you on probable causes and treatment alternatives.
Differentiating Between Hair Shedding and Hair Loss
Differentiating between hair shedding and hair loss can help you determine whether the amount of hair you are losing is normal or if it needs to be addressed further. Here are some factors to consider when deciding between the two:
Hair Shedding
:
Hair Amount
: Shedding is the term used to describe the natural process of hair shedding as part of the hair growth cycle. The loss of 50 to 100 hairs per day is typical and can be observed when brushing, washing, or styling your hair.
Distribution
: On the scalp, shed hairs are usually dispersed equally. They might be discovered while washing your hair, on your pillow, or in your hairbrush. They do not cause bald spots or observable thinning.
Regrowth
: As part of the hair growth cycle, lost hair is replaced by new hair. In places where hair was shed, new hair should start to grow.
Hair Loss
:
Excessive Amount
: Hair loss is the term used to describe an abnormally high rate of hair shedding. It may be a sign of hair loss if you are balding in patches or losing clumps of hair, noticing thinning or experiencing noticeable clumping.
Patterned Thinning
: Hair loss frequently exhibits distinct patterns. As an illustration, hair loss in men with male pattern baldness typically begins at the hairline or crown and advances over time. In women, hair loss may result in thinning across the crown or widening of the part.
Slower Regrowth or No Regrowth
: Hair loss can result in slower or no regrowth of hair in affected areas. If you notice that hair is not growing back or the thinning/balding areas are not showing signs of improvement, it may be a sign of hair loss.
Underlying Causes
: A number of things, including hormonal changes, alopecia areata, scalp infections, nutritional deficiencies, medications, and genetic predisposition, can lead to hair loss.
Common Causes of Hair Shedding
Numerous factors, including both short-term and long-term conditions, can cause hair loss. The following are some typical reasons for hair loss:
Telogen Effluvium
: This is a typical reason for momentary hair loss. It can be brought on by physical or emotional stress, illness, surgery, childbirth, or major life changes. Telogen effluvium causes the hair growth cycle to be disrupted, causing more hair follicles to enter the resting (telogen) phase and eventually shed. The shedding usually occurs a few months after the triggering event.
Hormonal Changes
: Hormonal fluctuations can have an impact on hair growth and shedding. Women, for example, may experience postpartum hair shedding as a result of hormonal changes. Similarly, hormonal changes associated with menopause can result in increased hair shedding.
Nutritional Deficiencies
: A lack of essential nutrients such as iron, zinc, biotin, and protein can have an impact on hair health. Hair shedding or thinning can occur when these nutrients are deficient. A well-balanced diet and, if necessary, supplements can help address nutritional deficiencies.
Medications and Treatments
: Certain medications, such as those used for chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or as part of autoimmune disease treatments, can cause hair loss or shedding. Additionally, stopping certain medications (for example, birth control pills) may cause temporary shedding.
Scalp Infections and Conditions
: Scalp infections, such as ringworm, or conditions, such as seborrheic dermatitis, can cause hair loss. These conditions can cause inflammation and disrupt the growth cycle of the hair.
Alopecia Areata
: Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes patchy hair loss. It occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the hair follicles, resulting in hair loss or, in some cases, complete baldness.
Overstyling and Hair Practises
: Hair breakage and shedding can be brought on by harsh hair treatments, tight hairstyles (like braids and ponytails), and excessive heat styling. Physical strain weakens the hair shaft, which causes more shedding.
Aging
: As we age, hair growth cycles may slow down, and hair density can decrease. This can lead to overall thinning and increased shedding.
Genetic Factors
: Genetic predisposition can contribute to hair shedding and hair loss. Conditions like male or female pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia) can cause gradual hair thinning and increased shedding over time.
Stress and Hair Loss: Unraveling the Connection
The link between stress and hair loss is complicated and multifaceted. While acute stress is unlikely to cause significant hair loss, chronic or long-term stress can contribute to hair loss and aggravate certain hair loss conditions. Here's a closer look at the stress-hair-loss connection:
Telogen Effluvium
: Telogen effluvium occurs when prolonged or severe stress disrupts the normal hair growth cycle. In this condition, more hair follicles than usual enter the resting (telogen) phase, resulting in increased shedding a few months later. Telogen effluvium is often temporary, and hair typically regrows once the stressors are resolved.
Trichotillomania
: Trichotillomania is a psychological disorder characterized by a compulsive desire to pull out one's hair. This self-inflicted hair loss can result in visible patches of hair loss.
Alopecia Areata
: Stress may play a role in the onset or progression of alopecia areata, an autoimmune condition that causes patchy hair loss. While stress does not cause alopecia areata, it can be a precipitating or exacerbating factor.
Aggravating Underlying Conditions
: Stress can exacerbate certain hair loss conditions, such as androgenetic alopecia (pattern baldness) or seborrheic dermatitis. Although these conditions may not be brought on by stress alone, it can influence their development or severity.
Behavioral Factors
: Stress can cause people to use unhealthy coping mechanisms like poor eating habits, sleep deprivation, or skipping self-care rituals. These elements can contribute to hair loss and have an indirect impact on hair health.
Hormonal Changes and Hair Shedding: Pregnancy, Menopause, and More
Hormonal changes can have a substantial impact on hair loss and shedding. Hormone fluctuations can interrupt the hair growth cycle, resulting in variations in hair density and shedding patterns. Here are some examples of how hormonal changes during pregnancy, menopause, and other conditions might influence hair shedding:
Pregnancy
: Hormonal changes, particularly an increase in estrogen levels, can cause the anagen (growth) phase of the hair cycle to be prolonged. This can result in thicker, fuller hair and less shedding. However, hormone levels quickly return to normal after giving birth, resulting in a higher percentage of hairs entering the telogen (resting) phase. This shift can result in a temporary increase in hair shedding known as postpartum telogen effluvium. Hair shedding typically resolves on its own within a few months as the hair growth cycle returns to normal.
Menopause
: Estrogen and progesterone levels decrease during menopause. Oestrogen prolongs the anagen phase and keeps hair dense. The decrease in estrogen during menopause can cause hair thinning and loss. Furthermore, hormonal imbalances and variations in androgen (male hormone) levels might impact hair development patterns, resulting in hair loss in specific places.
Hormonal Imbalances
: Hormonal abnormalities, such as those associated with PCOS or thyroid diseases, can affect hair growth and shedding. PCOS, which is characterized by high androgen levels, can result in excessive hair shedding or hair loss in a male-pattern distribution. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can alter the hair growth cycle, resulting in hair loss or thinning.
Birth Control Pills
: Beginning or discontinuing birth control pills can result in temporary hair loss or changes in hair growth patterns. These medications' hormonal changes can disrupt the hair growth cycle, resulting in temporary telogen effluvium. Hair shedding usually returns to normal after a few months as the body adjusts to hormonal changes.
Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)
: HRT, which is commonly used to treat menopausal symptoms, has the potential to influence hair growth and shedding. The type and balance of hormones used in the therapy can have an effect on hair density. Supplementing with oestrogen can help maintain hair thickness, whereas different types of progestins may have different effects on hair growth.
Nutritional Deficiencies: Impact on Hair Health and Shedding
Nutritional deficiencies can negatively impact hair health and contribute to increased hair shedding. Adequate nutrient intake is critical for maintaining healthy hair growth and preventing hair loss. The following are some important nutrients and their roles in hair health:
Iron
: One of the most common nutritional deficiencies associated with hair shedding is iron deficiency, also known as anemia. Iron is required for adequate oxygen and nutrient supply to the hair follicles. Inadequate iron levels can cause the hair growth cycle to be disrupted, resulting in increased hair shedding or even hair loss.
Protein
: The main component of hair is a protein known as keratin. Hair that is not getting enough protein can become fragile, brittle, and prone to breaking. Lean meats, fish, eggs, legumes, and dairy products are among the sources of protein that support healthy hair growth.
Biotin
: Biotin, also referred to as vitamin B7, is necessary for strong hair growth. It encourages the keratinization process and strengthens the hair shaft. Hair loss, brittle hair, and hair thinning are all symptoms of a biotin deficiency.
Zinc
: Zinc is essential for the development and maintenance of hair tissue. The hair growth cycle may be thrown off by a zinc deficiency, leading to more hair falling out or shedding.
Vitamins A, C, and E
: These vitamins are antioxidants that help protect hair follicles from oxidative stress. They help to maintain scalp health and promote hair growth. These vitamin deficiencies can weaken hair strands and contribute to hair shedding.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
: Found in fatty fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts, omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and promote scalp health. A lack of omega-3 fatty acids may cause a dry scalp, dull hair, and increased hair shedding.
Vitamin D
: Vitamin D aids in hair follicle cycling and growth. Low vitamin D levels have been linked to hair loss conditions such as alopecia areata and telogen effluvium.
Identifying Excessive Hair Shedding
Identifying excessive hair shedding can help you determine whether the amount of hair loss you are experiencing is normal or if it needs to be addressed further. Here are some symptoms of excessive hair shedding:
Increased Hair Fall
: If you notice a significant increase in the amount of hair you are losing compared to your normal shedding pattern, this could be a sign of excessive hair shedding. This can include finding hair clumps on your pillow, in the shower drain, or too much hair on your hairbrush or comb.
Thinning or Bald Patches
: Excessive shedding can lead to observable hair thinning, particularly around the crown, part line, or temples. If you notice noticeable bald patches or a widening of the part, this might be a sign of a more serious hair loss issue.
Changes in Hair Density
: If you notice that your hair has become overall more sparse or visibly thinner, this may indicate excessive hair shedding. You can determine this by contrasting the thickness of your hair today with its previous state.
Recurring or Prolonged Shedding
: Normally, hair sheds for a set period of time before growing back. If you notice that your hair is consistently thinning or that it does so for a long time without showing any signs of regrowth, this might be an indication of excessive shedding.
Scalp Sensitivity or Itching
: Excessive hair loss occasionally comes with scalp sensitivity, itching, or irritation. These symptoms might be indicative of a condition that results in excessive shedding.
When to Be Concerned: Signs of Excessive Hair Loss
Excessive hair loss, commonly known as alopecia, might be concerning. Noticeable thinning, a receding hairline or widening part, bald patches, excessive hair shedding, changes in hair texture or quality, scalp conditions, and family history are some symptoms to look out for. If you observe any of these symptoms or have concerns about significant hair loss, you should see a doctor or a dermatologist. They can assess your specific condition, do a comprehensive examination, run any necessary tests, and offer relevant counsel or treatment options based on the underlying reason for the severe hair loss.
Hair Loss Due to Medications, Illness, or Surgery
Hair loss can happen as an adverse reaction to some drugs, as a result of an illness, or after surgery. These are some typical scenarios where these elements may cause hair loss:
Medication
: Hair loss is a side effect of many medications. These may consist of:
Chemotherapy drugs
: These medicines are made to attack quickly dividing cells, such as hair follicles. Hair loss is a frequent adverse reaction to cancer treatment. However, once the course of treatment is over, hair typically grows back.
Anticoagulants (blood thinners)
: Although it is typically reversible, some anticoagulant medications may cause hair shedding.
Hormonal treatments
: Some hormonal medications, including those used for birth control or hormone replacement therapy (HRT), can occasionally cause hair loss or alter the pattern of hair growth. These outcomes may differ based on the particular medication and personal elements.
If you are concerned about hair loss brought on by medication, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider. They can assess your situation and, if necessary, talk about potential replacements or adjustments to your treatment plan.
Illness or Medical Conditions
: A number of ailments or medical conditions, such as:
Thyroid disorders
: Both hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid) and hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid) can result in hair loss.
Autoimmune disorders
: The immune system may mistakenly attack the hair follicles in conditions like alopecia areata, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and others, leading to hair loss.
Infections of the scalp
: Fungi infections, like ringworm, can result in hair loss in the affected areas.
Nutritional deficiencies
: Hair health can be impacted, and hair loss can be exacerbated by inadequate intake or absorption of vital nutrients.
As soon as you suspect an underlying medical condition is the cause of your hair loss, consult a dermatologist or healthcare provider for a thorough assessment and advice on the best course of action.
Surgery or Trauma
: Telogen effluvium is a type of hair loss that is brought on by physical stress, such as major surgery. The stress of the surgery can cause more hair follicles to enter the resting (telogen) phase, resulting in increased hair shedding a few months later.  Hair usually regrows within six to nine months once the body has recovered from the stress.
Understanding Scalp Conditions and Their Effect on Hair Shedding
Scalp conditions can influence hair shedding because they disrupt the normal functioning of hair follicles and the scalp environment. Here are some of the most common scalp conditions and how they affect hair shedding:
Scalp Psoriasis
: Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition that can affect the scalp. It causes itchy and uncomfortable red, scaly patches on the scalp. Inflammation brought on by scalp psoriasis can alter the cycle of hair growth and increase hair loss.
Seborrheic Dermatitis
: Seborrheic dermatitis is a common scalp condition characterized by redness, itching, and flaking of the scalp. Excessive oil production (sebum) and the presence of a yeast called Malassezia on the scalp can cause inflammation and disrupt the hair growth cycle, resulting in hair loss.
Folliculitis
: The most common bacterial or fungal cause of folliculitis is inflammation or infection of the hair follicles. It can cause small, red bumps or pustules on the scalp. Severe cases of folliculitis can cause hair follicle damage and shedding.
Scalp Infections
: Infections that affect the scalp, such as ringworm (a fungal infection) or bacterial infections, can cause hair shedding.  Infections of this type can cause inflammation, damage to hair follicles, and disrupt the hair growth cycle.
Allergic Reactions
: Allergic reactions to specific hair care products, such as shampoos, conditioners, or styling products, can result in scalp irritation, redness, and inflammation. This can cause hair loss, especially if the reaction is severe or long-lasting.
Traction Alopecia
: A type of hair loss brought on by excessive pulling or stress on the hair, traction alopecia is frequently brought on by tight hairstyles (such as ponytails, braids), as well as the use of hair extensions. Prolonged hair pulling can injure the follicles and result in hair loss in the afflicted areas.
Hair Care Practices and Hair Loss
Hair care practices have a substantial impact on hair health, and certain practices can contribute to hair loss. Overuse of heat styling equipment, traction and pulling with harsh chemical treatments, inappropriate hair care techniques, chemical hair products, poor nutrition and diet, and stress on wet hair are some hair care practices that might potentially lead to hair loss. You may help reduce the chance of hair loss and boost overall hair health by adopting good hair care practices and avoiding destructive behaviors. If you have hair difficulties or are suffering significant hair loss, it is best to consult a healthcare professional or a dermatologist for a full evaluation and personalized advice.
Avoiding Hair Damage: Gentle Styling and Proper Hair Care
Gentle styling practices and proper hair care are essential for avoiding hair damage and promoting healthy hair. Here are some tips to help you keep your hair healthy:
Limit Heat Styling
: Use heat-styling tools such as flat irons, curling irons, and blow dryers as little as possible.  Excessive heat can cause hair shaft damage, resulting in breakage and dryness. If you must use heat styling tools, use a heat protector and the lowest heat setting possible.
Use Gentle Hair Accessories
: Select hair accessories that are gentle on the hair, such as scrunchies or hair ties made of soft fabric or materials that do not cause pulling or breakage. Avoid using rubber bands or other tight accessories that can cause tension and damage.
Avoid Tight Hairstyles
: Avoid tight ponytails, braids, buns, or extensions, as they put too much tension or pull on the hair. Choose looser styles that allow your hair to move naturally and reduce stress on your hair follicles.
Be Gentle with Wet Hair
: Wet hair is more fragile and prone to breakage.  Brushing or combing your hair aggressively while it is wet can cause damage. Start detangling from the ends, working your way up to the roots, with a wide-toothed comb or a brush designed specifically for wet hair.
Choose Gentle Hair Care Products
: Choose hair care products that are appropriate for your hair type and free of harsh chemicals such as sulphates and fragrances. Look for products that promote moisture, nutrient absorption, and overall hair health. Consider your scalp's sensitivity when selecting products.
Trim Split Ends on a Regular Basis
: Regular trims help remove split ends, preventing them from traveling up the hair shaft and causing additional damage. Aim for a trim every 8-12 weeks, or as needed, to keep healthy ends.
Protect Hair from Environmental Damage
: Shield your hair from environmental stressors like excessive sun exposure, chlorine in swimming pools, and harsh weather conditions. Wear a hat or use protective products when exposed to the sun, and rinse your hair thoroughly after swimming.
Maintain a Healthy Diet
: Proper nutrition is crucial for healthy hair. Include a balanced diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and proteins. Foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats support hair health from within.
Handle with Care
: Be gentle when handling your hair in general. Avoid excessive tugging, brushing, or manipulation, which can lead to breakage. Patience and a gentle touch go a long way toward preserving hair health.
Shampooing and Conditioning for Healthy Hair
Proper shampooing and conditioning of your hair might help to keep it healthy. Choosing the proper products, shampooing method, conditioning technique, frequency of shampooing, avoiding over-shampooing, and deep conditioning are some guidelines to follow for healthy hair care during the shampooing and conditioning process. Keep in mind that hair care regimens can differ depending on individual needs and preferences. It's critical to pay attention to your hair and change your routine as needed. If you have specific concerns about your hair or scalp, seek personalized advice from a healthcare expert or a hair care specialist.
Brushing and Styling Techniques: Minimizing Hair Breakage
Proper brushing and styling techniques can help reduce breakage and keep hair healthy. Choose the Right Brush, Begin with Dry or Damp Hair, Use a Detangling Spray or Conditioner, Begin Detangling from the Ends, and so on. Avoid brushing wet hair, limit your use of heat styling tools, protect your hair at night, avoid tight hairstyles and hair accessories, and trim regularly. By using these brushing and styling techniques, you can reduce hair breakage and preserve overall hair health. To keep your hair strong and robust, remember to be gentle, patient, and attentive to its requirements.
Strategies for Hair Loss Prevention and Promoting Regrowth
Prevention of hair loss and promotion of regrowth entail a combination of lifestyle changes, proper hair care, and potential medical interventions. Here are some possible solutions:
Maintain a Balanced Diet
: Make sure you are getting enough protein, iron, zinc, biotin, vitamins A, C, and E, and omega-3 fatty acids for your hair. Consume a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats.
Avoid Excessive Heat Styling and Harsh Chemical Treatments
: Use heat styling tools sparingly and avoid harsh chemical treatments that can harm your hair. Choose more natural and gentle hair care regimens.
Gentle Hair Care
: To avoid pulling and tugging, use a wide-toothed comb or a brush with soft bristles. Avoid harsh brushing or combing when detangling wet hair.
Avoid Traction and Tight Hairstyles
: Hairstyles that pull tightly on the hair, such as ponytails, braids, or buns, should be avoided. Allow your hair to rest between such styles to relieve tension on the hair follicles.
Manage Stress
: Prolonged stress can make hair loss worse. Find healthy ways to cope with stress, such as exercise, meditation, yoga, or hobbies. Make self-care and relaxation techniques a priority.
Protect Your Hair from Environmental Damage
: Protect your hair from excessive sun exposure, chlorine in swimming pools, and harsh weather conditions. To protect yourself, wear hats or use protective products.
Do not Smoke
: Smoking can have a negative impact on hair health and contribute to hair loss. Quitting smoking or avoiding secondhand smoke exposure can improve overall hair and scalp health.
Be Mindful of Medications
: Certain medications can contribute to hair loss. If you notice excessive shedding while taking a specific medication, talk to your doctor about other options.
Treat Underlying Scalp Conditions
: Address any scalp conditions promptly, such as dandruff, psoriasis, or seborrheic dermatitis. These conditions can affect hair health and contribute to hair loss if left untreated.
Consult a Healthcare Professional
: If you are experiencing significant hair loss or have questions about regrowth, see a dermatologist or a healthcare professional. They can assess your specific situation, identify underlying causes, and suggest appropriate treatments or interventions, such as medications or procedures.
Nourishing Your Hair: Nutrients for Hair Health and Growth
Nourishing your hair with the right nutrients is important for promoting hair health and supporting growth. Here are some important nutrients that affect the health of your hair:
Protein
: The main component of hair is a protein known as keratin. Adequate protein intake is essential for maintaining strong and healthy hair. Lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy products, legumes, nuts, and seeds are all excellent sources of protein for healthy hair.
Iron
: Iron aids in the growth and maintenance of hair and is necessary for the proper delivery of oxygen to the hair follicles. Fish, leafy green vegetables, legumes, red meat, poultry, and fortified cereals are a few examples of foods high in iron.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
: Omega-3 fatty acids are necessary fats that support the health of the scalp, nourish the hair follicles, and lessen inflammation. Walnuts, flaxseeds, chia seeds, and fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, and sardines) are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids.
Biotin
: Biotin, also referred to as vitamin B7, is necessary for normal hair growth. It aids in keratin production, the protein responsible for the structure of the hair. Eggs, nuts, seeds, sweet potatoes, and leafy green vegetables are among the foods high in biotin.
Vitamin E
: As an antioxidant, vitamin E aids in preventing oxidative stress on hair follicles. It enhances scalp blood flow and benefits the health of the hair. Nuts, seeds, avocado, spinach, sunflower oil, and avocado are all excellent sources of vitamin E.
Vitamin C
: Vitamin C is necessary for the synthesis of collagen, which is crucial for the durability and structure of hair. It also aids in the absorption of iron, promoting better iron levels for healthy hair growth. Vitamin C can be found in abundance in citrus fruits, berries, kiwi, bell peppers, and leafy green vegetables.
Zinc
: Zinc aids in the maintenance of a healthy scalp and plays a role in hair growth. It contributes to DNA and protein synthesis, both of which are necessary for the proper operation of hair follicles. Oysters, red meat, poultry, pumpkin seeds, and legumes are among the foods high in zinc.
Vitamin D
: Hair follicles contain vitamin D receptors, and vitamin D is crucial for hair follicle cycling and hair growth. The natural source of vitamin D is sunlight exposure, but it can also be found in fortified dairy products, fatty fish, and supplements.
