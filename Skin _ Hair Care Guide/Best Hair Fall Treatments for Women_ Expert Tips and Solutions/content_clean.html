<p><b></b><span>Hair loss can be unpleasant, but there are effective treatments and expert advice available to help manage and reduce it. In this blog, we'll look at several expert-recommended methods and tips for treating <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-fall-hair-loss">hair loss</a> in women.</span></p>
<h2><b>Understanding Hair Fall in Women</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Understanding Hair Fall in Women" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Understanding_Hair_Fall_in_Women_480x480.jpg?v=1723030569"/></div>
<p><span>Hair loss in women happens when people who are assigned female at birth lose more than 125 hairs each day. This can lead to shedding, bald spots, and thinning hair. A <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">dermatologist</a> can help you figure out what caused your hair loss and suggest treatment choices.</span></p>
<h3><b>Common Causes of Hair Fall</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Common Causes of Hair Fall" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Common_Causes_of_Hair_Fall_480x480.jpg?v=1723030569"/></div>
<p><span>People usually lose 50 to 100 hairs per day. This is normally undetectable because new hair grows in at the same time. Hair loss happens when new hair does not grow to replace the lost hair. Hair loss is usually associated with one or more of the following factors:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Family history</b><span>: The most prevalent cause of hair loss is a hereditary disorder that develops with age. This disorder is known as androgenic alopecia, male-pattern <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/bald-patches">baldness</a>, and female-pattern baldness. It normally happens gradually and in predictable patterns—a receding hairline and bald spots in men, and thinning hair along the crown of the scalp in women.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hormonal changes and medical conditions</b><span>: Hormonal changes caused by pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, and thyroid disorders can all result in permanent or temporary hair loss. Alopecia areata, an immune-related condition that causes patchy hair loss, scalp infections including ringworm, and trichotillomania, a hair-pulling disorder.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Medications and supplements</b><span>: Certain drugs, such as those used to treat cancer, arthritis, depression, heart disease, gout, and high blood pressure, can cause hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Radiation therapy</b><span>: The hair may not grow back in the same way it did before.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Stressful event</b><span>: Many people experience hair thinning several months after a physical or emotional shock. This type of hair loss lasts only temporarily.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hairstyles and treatments</b><span>: Traction alopecia is a type of hair loss that can be brought on by overdoing hairstyling or pulling your hair taut in styles like cornrows or pigtails. Hot-oil Hair loss can also result from permanent <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-colour">hair color</a> and hair treatments. If scarring develops, hair loss may be permanent.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Hormonal Imbalances and Hair Loss</b></h3>
<p><span>Both men and women can experience hormone abnormalities, which can cause hair to thin or fall out. Often, addressing the imbalance promotes hair regrowth. Although most people associate hormonal imbalances with estrogen or testosterone, thyroid disorders can also cause hair thinning.</span></p>
<h3><b>Impact of Stress on Hair Health</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Impact of Stress on Hair Health" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Impact_of_Stress_on_Hair_Health_480x480.jpg?v=1723030569"/></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Telogen effluvium</b><span>:</span> <span>Acute telogen effluvium is self-limiting and usually resolves after the underlying cause is addressed. Some studies suggest that the medicine minoxidil can help people with persistent telogen effluvium. However, more research is needed to prove its entire impact on hair shedding. Although there is limited information on the efficacy of treatments for <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/alopecia-areata">alopecia areata</a>, doctors recommend topical corticosteroids as the first-line treatment. Dermatologists may prescribe topical corticosteroids to children aged 10 and under, as well as corticosteroid injections to adults aged 10 and above who have patchy alopecia. A dermatologist may recommend topical immunotherapy for those who have severe alopecia (more than 50% scalp hair loss). This treatment resulted in hair regrowth for 74.6% of patients with patchy alopecia and 54.4% of people with alopecia totalis. However, 38.2% of participants reported a return of their alopecia.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Trichotillomania</b><span>:</span> <span>A healthcare team may employ a variety of therapy options to help control trichotillomania. Conservative approaches for youngsters, such as covering their hands with gloves or socks and cutting their hair short, can be beneficial. Habit reversal training, which is based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), helps a person identify cognitive distortions and the maladaptive actions associated with them (hair-pulling), as well as change them.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hormonal Changes</b><span>: Stress can cause hormonal abnormalities, which disrupt the <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hair-regrow-serum%20">hair growth</a> cycle. For example, high cortisol levels might disrupt the hair growth cycle and cause hair loss. Hair is thinning all over the scalp.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<div></div>
<h2><b>Dietary Changes for Healthier Hair</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Dietary Changes for Healthier Hair" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Dietary_Changes_for_Healthier_Hair_480x480.jpg?v=1723030569"/></div>
<p><span>A good diet can help keep your hair thick and lustrous. What you consume can also help prevent hair loss. If you are not getting specific nutrients from your diet, you may notice the impact in your hair.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Essential fatty acids, particularly omega-3s, are essential for maintaining healthy skin, hair, and nails. You should consume some of these omega-3-rich foods daily, including salmon, tuna, mackerel, and other fatty fish, flaxseed oil, flaxseeds, chia seeds, canola oil, walnuts, soybeans, tofu, and cruciferous vegetables. Vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid are also essential for your hair. Vegetarians and vegans frequently consume insufficient quantities.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>B6-rich foods include bananas, potatoes (both white and sweet), and spinach. Meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products are major sources of vitamin B12. Folic acid can be obtained from a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, including citrus fruits and tomatoes. It can be found in whole-grain and fortified-grain products, as well as beans and lentils.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Protein is also essential for hair health, although many people do not get enough. Lean meats, such as fish and poultry, eggs, and soy products, are excellent sources. Eat one serving every day.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Essential Nutrients for Hair Growth</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Essential Nutrients for Hair Growth" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Essential_Nutrients_for_Hair_Growth_480x480.jpg?v=1723030569"/></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Protein</b><span>:</span> <span>Keratin, a stiffened protein, is responsible for the structure of your hair. When your protein supplies are insufficient, the creation of this essential building block slows, resulting in slower and poorer hair growth. Lean meats like chicken and turkey, as well as seafood like tuna, halibut, and tilapia, are excellent sources of protein. Tofu, quinoa, low-fat mozzarella, and cottage cheeses are all excellent choices.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Biotin</b><span>:</span> <span>Lentils contain biotin, which has been demonstrated to increase hair development. Biotin interacts with cell enzymes to help generate amino acids, which are the molecules that make up the previously stated proteins. Researchers have even shown that too little biotin might cause hair loss. Other nutritious options include carrots, almonds, walnuts, and cauliflower. If you want to take a supplement, ask your doctor for a recommendation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Iron: </b><span>Your hair follicles get nutritious oxygen from the iron in your red blood cells. While the level of iron in your blood may be considered normal, there is a risk that you have low ferritin—the "bank" of iron that your body keeps on hand to draw from as needed. Low ferritin levels have been associated with slowed or stopped hair growth, as well as shedding. To avoid this, consume iron-rich foods such as oysters, clams, lean beef, eggs, tuna, soybeans, spinach, tofu, and garbanzo beans. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Omega-3 Fatty Acids</b><span>:</span> <span>Omega-3s can be found in the cell membranes of your scalp's skin as well as the natural oils that your scalp and hair create to keep themselves hydrated. Getting enough of these important fatty acids will help you avoid <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/dry-scalp">dry scalp</a> and promote hair growth and shine. Eating wild salmon and other fatty fish twice a week, such as striped sea bass or mackerel, will provide a healthy amount of omega-3s. If you're not a fan of fish, try plant-based alternatives such as flax seeds, walnuts, soybeans, and canola oil.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Water</b><span>:</span> <span>While your locks are mostly made of protein, they are also made of water and require moisture to prevent dryness and breakage. In addition to using a leave-in <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/conditioners">conditioner</a> or other hydrating products to soften strands, make sure to hydrate yourself by drinking lots of water every day. Eating water-rich fruits and vegetables also helps to keep your body hydrated.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>B Vitamins</b><span>:</span> <span>B6, B12, and folate help to produce red blood cells, which transport oxygen and nutrients throughout the body, including the scalp and hair follicles. If you don't receive enough B vitamins, your hair's cells can hunger, causing it to shed, grow slowly, and break easily. Pork tenderloin is high in these vitamins, but if you don't consume pork, beans, poultry, oats, and low-fat dairy products are other excellent sources.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Vitamin C</b><span>:</span> <span>This vital nutrient accomplishes several things to promote healthy hair: <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-vitamin-c3-serum">Vitamin C</a> improves iron absorption. It is also utilized to generate collagen, a structural fiber found in the body's connective tissue and required by hair follicles for proper growth. Vitamin C-rich foods include bell peppers, thyme, parsley, kale, Brussels sprouts, oranges, and strawberries.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Zinc</b><span>:</span> <span>This mineral strengthens your hair follicles and prevents hair loss by attaching to proteins. It also helps your oil glands operate properly, protecting your hair from dryness and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/dandruff">dandruff</a>. Shellfish such as oysters, crab, lobster, clams, and mussels contain a high concentration of zinc. Three ounces of oysters (approximately two medium-sized oysters) contain 493 percent of the daily recommended intake of zinc. Other zinc-rich foods include sunflower seeds, peanuts, pine nuts, beef, lamb, and pork, as well as cereals made with whole grains and bran.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Incorporating Protein-Rich Foods</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Incorporating Protein-Rich Foods" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Incorporating_Protein-Rich_Foods_480x480.jpg?v=1723030570"/></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Salmon</b><span>:</span> <span>Salmon is a fatty fish, which means it contains plenty of omega-3 fatty acids. Salmon is also a good source of protein and might help people feel fuller after meals. One salmon fillet (178 g) has 39.3 grams of protein.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Chicken breast</b><span>:</span> <span>Chicken breast is a lean protein source. When served without skin, protein accounts for the majority of the calories. A 100 g skinless chicken breast contains around 22.5 grams of protein.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Beef</b><span>:</span> <span>Beef contains a large quantity of protein per serving. A 3-ounce portion (85 g) of ground beef has approximately 21.3 grams of protein. There are several different sorts of beef to pick from. For maximum heart health, use lean beef wherever feasible to keep saturated fat intake to no more than 5-6% of daily calories.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Tuna</b><span>:</span> <span>Tuna is a high-quality, readily available protein source. It is also high in unsaturated fatty acids, which are good for the heart. One can (107 g) of tuna has around 20.3 grams of protein. Canned tuna is a good pantry staple to have on hand. It has a long shelf life and is less expensive than many other animal protein sources.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Bison</b><span>:</span> <span>Bison meat is a good source of protein. Bison meat is lean, with less fat per serving than beef. Bison is becoming more widely available, and some people utilize it as an alternative to beef. One 3 oz (85 g) of bison contains around 21.6 g of protein.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Pork</b><span>:</span> <span>Lean pork is a good protein source. Pork roasts and tenderloin are excellent supper options. People should avoid processed pork products, such as bacon because they include more saturated fat and sodium.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Turkey</b><span>:</span> <span>Turkey contains a significant amount of protein. Cooked turkey breast can contain approximately 25.6 g of protein per 3 oz (85 g) meal.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Halibut</b><span>:</span> <span>Halibut is a type of whitefish. It is a good source of lean protein, with around 29.3 g in half a fillet (159 g).</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Vitamins and Minerals for Hair Health</b></h3>
<p><span>Biotin is a well-known vitamin that promotes hair growth, and a shortage can result in hair loss. This can be found in a wide variety of meals, including whole grains, green vegetables, seafood, eggs, and nuts.</span></p>
<h3><b>Effective Medical Treatments</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Effective Medical Treatments" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Effective_Medical_Treatments_480x480.jpg?v=1723030569"/></div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Minoxidil (Rogaine)</b><span>:</span> <span>Minoxidil is available over the counter (without a prescription) in liquid, foam, and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/shampoos">shampoo</a> form. For maximum effectiveness, apply the product to the scalp and skin once a day for women and twice a day for men. Many people prefer to apply foam while their hair is wet. Many people find that minoxidil-containing products help them regrow their hair, decrease the rate of hair loss, or do both. It will take at least six months of treatment to prevent additional hair loss and begin hair regrowth. It may take several months to determine whether the treatment is working for you. If it is effective, you will need to continue taking the medication indefinitely to get the benefits. Possible side effects include scalp irritation and unwanted hair growth on the skin around the face and hands.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Finasteride (Propecia)</b><span>: This is a prescription medication for guys. You take medication every day. Many men who use finasteride notice a slowdown in hair loss, and others may even see new hair growth. It may take several months to determine whether it is working for you. To maintain the benefits, you must continue to take it. Finasteride may not be as effective for males over 60. Finasteride's rare adverse effects include decreased sex drive and sexual function, as well as an increased risk of developing prostate cancer. Women who are or may be pregnant should avoid handling crushed or broken pills.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Other medications</b><span>:</span> <span>Other oral alternatives include spironolactone (Carospir, Aldactone) and oral dutasteride (Avodart).</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Topical Treatments: Minoxidil</b></h4>
<p><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/scalp-solution">Minoxidil</a> topical solution or foam. Minoxidil is a medicine that promotes fresh hair growth in cases of genetic hair loss. You can use this topical solution or foam on your scalp to stimulate hair growth.</span></p>
<h4><b>Oral Medications: Finasteride and Spironolactone</b></h4>
<p><span>Finasteride is an off-label medication for hair thinning in women. There have been some encouraging reports of hair regrowth; however, studies have shown that greater doses are required in women to be beneficial, and it is contraindicated in women with breast cancer. Finasteride, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, is used to treat men's receding hairlines or baldness by inhibiting male hormone production in the scalp, which stops hair growth. It is taken once a day as a pill and may take up to six months to improve. Women typically require higher doses, and the outcomes are not as spectacular as those found in men.</span></p>
<p><span>Spironolactone, a medication in the aldosterone receptor antagonist class, is another tablet-based hair loss therapy option. Like finasteride, it reduces hormone production, which contributes to androgenetic alopecia. While it is FDA-approved for the treatment of fluid retention caused by liver and renal disorders, it is not yet approved for female-pattern hair loss owing to alopecia, a kind of hair loss caused by male sex hormone overproduction.  Spironolactone is sometimes administered after other therapies, particularly minoxidil, fail. It can be added to both topical and oral minoxidil to provide further benefits. It rarely works for female hair loss caused by non-hormonal factors such as stress, nutritional inadequacies, or chemotherapy.</span></p>
<h4><b>Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy</b></h4>
<p><span>PRP, or platelet-rich plasma therapy, is a medical treatment that can aid in healing, regeneration, and growth. It is frequently used to treat injured tendons, ligaments, and muscles. PRP therapy involves three steps. It works by withdrawing blood, processing it, and injecting it into the damaged area. According to research, PRP injections may help with hair loss in a variety of ways. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>PRP may promote hair growth and thickness while also preventing hair follicles from prematurely shedding.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>PRP may help to increase hair thickness and density.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>PRP may stimulate hair growth by increasing blood supply to the hair follicles.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Natural Remedies for Hair Fall</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Natural Remedies for Hair Fall" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Natural_Remedies_for_Hair_Fall_480x480.jpg?v=1723030569"/></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Massage</b><span>:</span> <span>Massaging the scalp with <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-oil">hair oils</a> and masks stimulates it and may increase hair thickness. Stretching during the massage may promote hair development and thickness in the dermal papilla cells, which are found at the base of the hair follicles. These cells are essential for hair regeneration and growth. It has been shown that scalp massage increases hair growth, blood flow, and scalp health in humans. Massage your scalp can also help relieve stress and tension, which can lead to hair loss. To massage your scalp, use your fingertips rather than your fingernails. Move in small circles across your scalp, using mild to medium pressure.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Aloe vera</b><span>:</span> <span>Aloe vera may aid with hair loss. Some anecdotal data suggests that aloe vera can aid by calming your scalp, moisturizing your hair, eliminating dandruff, and unclogging hair follicles. However, it implies that only a small number of animal studies exist. More study of humans is required. You can use pure aloe vera gel on your scalp several times per week. You can also use aloe vera-based shampoo and conditioner.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Coconut oil</b><span>:</span> <span>Coconut oil includes lauric acid, a fatty acid that penetrates the hair shaft and reduces protein loss. It was also discovered that using coconut oil on the scalp may improve the microbiome of the scalp, making it healthier and promoting hair follicle growth. Coconut oil can be applied before or after washing your hair, depending on your hair type. If your hair is greasy, you can apply a leave-in treatment overnight or for a few hours before washing it. Massage coconut oil into your scalp and hair. If your hair is dry, you can apply it as a leave-in treatment.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Viviscal</b><span>:</span> <span>Viviscal is a natural <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-growth-supplements">hair growth supplement</a> that may stimulate hair growth in adults with thinning hair. It is rich in minerals, including shark and mollusk powder, organic silica, vitamin C (produced from acerola cherry), biotin, and zinc. These chemicals may help to renew and strengthen existing cells. To observe effects, take the capsules twice a day for at least 6 months. Viviscal also manufactures shampoo and conditioners.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Fish oil</b><span>: Fish oil supplements are rich in nutrients such as proteins and omega-3 fatty acids. Taking an omega supplement, together with <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/antioxidants">antioxidants</a>, improves hair density, diameter, and loss. Omega-3 fatty acids may also help to decrease inflammation and strengthen immunity. These could help to accelerate your hair growth cycle and improve your overall health. Before integrating supplements into your diet, consult with a healthcare expert and adhere to the manufacturer's advised dosage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Ginseng</b><span>:</span> <span>Ginseng pills may aid with hair development by activating hair follicles. Ginsenosides are ginseng's active components, and they are thought to be responsible for the herb's beneficial effects on hair. Always take supplements as suggested, and be aware of any potential negative effects.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Onion juice</b><span>:</span> <span>If you can tolerate the odor of onion juice, you might discover that the benefits are worthwhile. Onion juice may help stimulate hair growth and treat patchy alopecia areata. This is an autoimmune disorder in which the body assaults hair follicles, resulting in hair loss throughout the body. Onion juice is also said to promote circulation. It enhanced keratinocyte growth factor, a key regulator of hair follicle formation and growth. To utilize onion juice, mix a few onions and extract the juice. Apply the juice to your scalp and hair, then leave it for at least 15 minutes. Then apply shampoo.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Rosemary oil</b><span>:</span> <span>Rosemary oil may help promote new hair development and prevent hair loss. It could be equally effective as minoxidil in treating androgenetic alopecia. Massage a few drops of rosemary oil into your hair and scalp before rinsing. You can repeat this several times per week. You can also mix a few drops of rosemary oil into your shampoo and conditioner every day.  However, avoid applying essential oils directly to the skin and instead mix them with a carrier oil or shampoo.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Geranium oil</b><span>:</span> <span>Geranium, or Pelargonium graveolens, is a fragrant shrub endemic to South Africa. Geranium oil is a concentrated oil derived from the leaves. Geranium oil stimulated hair growth and improved circulation in mice. Add three drops of geranium essential oil to eight drops of carrier oil. Apply it immediately to your hair. You can also put a few drops in your shampoo and conditioner.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Lemon oil</b><span>: Lemon oil may help keep your scalp healthy and promote hair development. Similarly, it suggests that sinapic acid, a bioactive molecule found in lemons, may help stimulate hair growth. Apply freshly squeezed lemon juice to your scalp and hair for 15 minutes before shampooing. The lemon essential oil can also be used to make a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-mask">hair mask</a> by diluting it with carrier oil.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><b>Aloe Vera for Scalp Health</b></h4>
<p><span>You can apply raw aloe vera gel directly to your hair and scalp. Apply it with your hands to your scalp, hair, and ends. To help lock in moisture, rub in a few drops of castor oil. Allow the aloe vera to soak for around 30 minutes before rinsing.</span></p>
<h4><b>Onion Juice for Hair Growth</b></h4>
<p><span>When applied to the hair and scalp, onion juice can supply additional sulfur to help support strong and thick hair, reducing hair loss and stimulating hair development. The sulfur in onions may also aid in <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/collagen">collagen</a> formation. Collagen, in turn, promotes the formation of healthy skin cells and hair growth.</span></p>
<h4><b>Green Tea Rinse</b></h4>
<p><span>Steep the green tea bags in water for at least an hour to allow the tea to brew and cool. To make a cold brew tea rinse, use the same quantity of water and soak the green tea bags overnight. Transfer the tea to a clean spray bottle. Shampoo and condition your hair as normal.</span></p>
<h2><b>Hair Care Routine for Reducing Hair Fall</b></h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Hair Care Routine for Reducing Hair Fall</b><span>: Do not scroll down this option just to avoid the unpleasant egg odor. Eggs are high in protein, sulfur, zinc, and phosphorus, making them an excellent treatment for recurrent hair loss. Eggs strengthen hair strands, encourage hair development, and help prevent split ends. Once you've established this practice, your nose will learn to relax, and you'll enjoy the pleasure of wearing thick, luscious hair. Mix one egg with a spoonful of honey and olive oil. Using a brush, apply the paste from the roots to the tips. After 25 minutes, rinse with a gentle shampoo and cool water. It is used once every week.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Coconut Spa</b><span>:  The oil's fatty acids strengthen your hair roots and stimulate excessive hair growth. Warm 2-3 teaspoons of coconut oil and apply it to your scalp. Massage it gently and let it on overnight (or for 20 minutes during the day). Rinse with a light shampoo the next morning (or the same day).</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Alma and lime juice hair pack to stop hair loss</b><span>:  Amla, which contains Vitamin C, stimulates incredible hair growth. Mix 1 teaspoon of amla powder with a few drops of lime juice to produce a thick paste. Apply the paste to your scalp for 40 minutes, then rinse with a gentle <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-foaming-face-wash">cleanser</a>. It's used once or twice a week.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Methi Hair Mask for Hair Growth</b><span>:</span><b>  </b><span>Methi, also known as fenugreek, is an efficient home treatment for repairing damaged hair follicles and promoting healthy hair development. The high protein content provides natural nourishment to the hair, preventing dandruff and promoting a voluminous bounce. Soak two tablespoons of fenugreek seeds overnight, then grind them into a paste the next morning. Apply the paste to your scalp and rinse with cold water after an hour. It is used once every week.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Green Tea Hair Cleanser to Control Hair Fall</b><span>: Green tea can do more than just wake you up in the morning; it can also relieve stress and reduce body fat.  Soak one or two green tea bags in a cup of boiling water. Cover the lid. Allow the tea to soak in the water for 5 minutes. Then let the mixture cool. Pour the cooled concoction over your hair and scalp, gently massaging the roots, then rinse with water after an hour. You can use it twice every week.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Aloe vera hair mask</b><span>:  Aloe vera is well-known for its powerful ability to heal dandruff and hair loss. This cooling plant reduces hair loss, relaxes the scalp, and clears hair follicles clogged with excessive oil secretion. Squeeze some aloe vera gel onto your fingers and massage it directly into the scalp. Rinse off the hair mask after an hour. It is used 2-3 times per week.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Onion Juice for Hair Regrowth</b><span>:</span><b>  </b><span>Don't judge this amazing treatment based on the prospect of shedding a few tears and dealing with the onion's pungent odor. Onion has recently gained popularity in the hair fall. Regular onion users enjoy shiny, healthy, thicker, and longer hair by improving blood circulation to hair follicles and delivering natural scalp nourishment! Grind onions to get their juice. Dip a cotton ball in the juice and apply it evenly to the scalp. Wash your hair after 30 minutes. It is used once every week.</span></p>

<h3><b>Choosing the Right Shampoo and Conditioner</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Choosing the Right Shampoo and Conditioner" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Choosing_the_Right_Shampoo_and_Conditioner_480x480.jpg?v=1723030569"/></div>
<p><span>Look for healthy ingredients like argan oil, coconut oil, shea butter, and vitamin E. The ideal anti-dandruff shampoo for hair loss will be a creamy, scalp-friendly product. Anti <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/damaged-frizzy-hair">frizz</a> ingredients additionally aid in detangling the lengths and preventing breakage later.</span></p>
<h4><b>Importance of Regular Scalp Massages</b></h4>
<p><span>Every day, massage your scalp to improve blood circulation and strengthen your follicles. However, make sure to brush lightly and not vigorously. This may cause your hair to break.</span></p>
<p><span>If you use oil to massage your scalp, make sure to rinse it out within an hour. Oiling your scalp daily is not suggested since it draws grime. It's also vital to use shampoo to remove the oil. However, shampooing daily might remove important oils and moisture from your scalp. Thus, oiling and shampooing twice a week is perfect.</span></p>
<h4><b>Avoiding Heat and Chemical Damage</b></h4>
<p><span>If possible, give your hair a break from heat styling for a few weeks or even longer. This will allow healthy new hair to grow. If you can't fully avoid using hairdryers, straighteners, or curling tongs on your hair, attempt to limit the amount of time you do.</span></p>
<h3><b>Advanced Hair Fall Solutions</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Advanced Hair Fall Solutions" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Advanced_Hair_Fall_Solutions_480x480.jpg?v=1723030569"/></div>
<p><span>The most popular options include minoxidil (Rogaine). Minoxidil is available over the counter (without a prescription) in liquid, foam, and shampoo form. For maximum effectiveness, apply the product to the scalp skin once daily for women and twice daily for men.</span></p>
<h4><b>Laser Therapy for Hair Growth</b></h4>
<p><span>Low-level laser therapy, commonly known as red light therapy or cold laser therapy, irradiates photons into scalp tissues. These photons are absorbed by weak cells, promoting hair growth.</span></p>
<p><span>The method is largely recognized as safe, acceptable, and less intrusive than hair transplant surgery.</span></p>
<h4><b>Hair Transplant Surgery</b></h4>
<p><span>Hair transplant surgery is a treatment for treating hair loss. There are various ways for hair transplants, but they all entail removing hair-bearing skin from one portion of the scalp and grafting it onto bald or thinning areas of the scalp or traumatized areas.</span></p>
<h4><b>Microneedling for Hair Regeneration</b></h4>
<p><span>A microneedling session aims to promote hair growth by increasing blood flow to the scalp. Microneedling is an excellent treatment for hair loss and thinning hair. In some situations, it can even stimulate hair growth. The microneedles create tiny incisions on the scalp, stimulating blood flow.</span></p>
<h3><b>Essential Oils for Hair Growth</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Essential Oils for Hair Growth" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Essential_Oils_for_Hair_Growth_480x480.jpg?v=1723030569"/></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Lavender Essential Oil</b><span>:</span> <span>Lavender oil can boost hair growth. Lavender oil has qualities that can stimulate cell growth and alleviate stress; animal researchers have discovered that this oil can promote rapid hair growth. Lavender oil also contains antimicrobial qualities that might benefit scalp health. Mix a few drops of lavender oil with 3 tablespoons of a carrier oil, such as olive or coconut oil, and apply to the scalp. Leave the essential oil in your hair for at least 10 minutes before rinsing and shampooing normally. You can use this hair oil several times per week to make your hair lustrous and strong.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Menthol</b><span>:</span> <span>Peppermint oil can cause a cool, tingling feeling by increasing circulation to the region being applied, and it may also aid in hair growth during the anagen (or growing) phase. Drop menthol into a carrier oil, massage it into the scalp, and keep it on for 5 minutes before washing with shampoo and conditioner.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Rosemary essential oil</b><span>:</span> <span>If you want to promote both hair thickness and hair growth, rosemary essential oil is an excellent choice due to its capacity to increase cell turnover. Rosemary oil works similarly to minoxidil, a common hair growth therapy, although it is less likely to induce itchy scalps as a side effect. Combine a few drops of rosemary oil with olive or coconut oil and apply to the scalp. Let it sit for at least 10 minutes before washing it off with shampoo. Do it twice a week for the best results.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cedarwood Essential Oil</b><span>:</span> <span>Cedarwood essential oil is supposed to stimulate hair growth and minimize hair loss by regulating the oil-producing glands on the scalp. Cedarwood essential oil contains antifungal and antibacterial characteristics and can be used to treat a variety of disorders that cause dandruff and hair loss. Cedarwood extract, combined with lavender and rosemary, creates a hair growth essential oil blend that helps with hair loss. Mix a few drops of cedarwood essential oil with 2 tablespoons of carrier oil, then massage into the scalp and leave for 10 minutes before washing off.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Lemongrass essential oil</b><span>:</span> <span>Dandruff is a very common issue, and you can use lemongrass oil as an excellent dandruff cure. Lemongrass oil is most effective against dandruff when applied daily. Add a few drops of lemongrass essential oil to your everyday shampoo or conditioner and massage it into your scalp.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Thyme Essential Oil</b><span>:</span> <span>Thyme can stimulate the scalp and prevent hair loss, hence promoting hair growth. Thyme oil, like cedarwood oil, is effective in the treatment of alopecia areata. It is also a restorative essential oil. Before applying to the scalp, combine only two drops with two teaspoons of carrier oil. Let the oil sit on your hair for around 10 minutes before rinsing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sage Essential Oil</b><span>:</span> <span>Sage oil includes the same linalyl acetate that makes lavender oil so beneficial in stimulating hair growth. Sage essential oil can strengthen hair while also promoting hair growth, making it more difficult to break. Mix 3 drops of sage oil into your preferred conditioner or 1 tablespoon of carrier oil. If you use essential oils daily, leave the oil in your hair for two minutes before washing it off. If you use it once or twice a week, keep the oil in your hair for 10 minutes before rinsing it with cold water.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Tea tree oil</b><span>:</span> <span>Tea tree oil offers effective scalp cleaning and antimicrobial effects. When used topically, tea tree oil can help draw out hair follicles and stimulate hair growth. Tea tree oil can be extracted in a variety of concentrations, therefore, while using it, follow the manufacturer's directions. Some include concentrated tea tree oil, while others are blended in cream form. Studies have also shown that a combination of tea tree oil and minoxidil is more beneficial than minoxidil alone in increasing hair growth, though further research is needed before using it alone. Use tea tree oil. In addition, tea trees are widely utilized in anti-dandruff products.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Ylang Ylang Essential Oil</b><span>: Although people with oily hair and skin should avoid this step, ylang-ylang oil is great for dry scalps because it stimulates sebum production. A lack of oil and sebum causes hair to become dry and brittle; ylang-ylang oil helps improve hair texture and minimize hair loss. Mix 5 drops of ylang-ylang essential oil into 2 tablespoons of heated oil. Massage into the scalp and cover with a warm cloth. Leave the oil on your hair for 30 minutes before rinsing it out.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Risks and potential complications</b><span>:</span> <span>The most serious hazards of essential oils include skin irritation and allergic reactions. The risks of utilizing essential oils are particularly prevalent when applied straight to the skin, hence, a carrier oil should be used to dilute the essential oil. Essential oil allergy responses are also more likely in those who have sensitive skin or are allergic to essential oils.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><b>Benefits of Rosemary Oil</b></h4>
<p><span>Rosemary oil is an aromatic oil that can be used as an aromatherapy treatment or applied directly to the skin. According to some studies, rosemary oil treatments may boost hair growth, increase vitality, and relieve pain. However, research on the medicinal properties of rosemary oil is limited.</span></p>
<h4><b>How to Use Peppermint Oil</b></h4>
<p><span>Peppermint oil is now widely recognized for its numerous health advantages, whether applied directly to the skin or consumed in different forms. Several studies have found that enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules, which allow the oil to pass past the stomach and dissolve in the intestines, may help treat common irritable bowel syndrome symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and gas. Peppermint oil that has not been enteric coated, on the other hand, may cause or worsen heartburn and nausea. Preliminary research suggests that <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/dietary-supplements">dietary supplements</a> containing a combination of peppermint oil and caraway oil may aid with dyspepsia.</span></p>
<h4><b>Lavender Oil for Hair Strengthening</b></h4>
<p><span>Lavender essential oil protects your scalp from bacteria thanks to its excellent antibacterial and antiseptic characteristics. It improves blood circulation in the scalp, hence strengthening the hair follicles. This, in turn, inhibits hair loss while promoting hair growth.</span></p>
<h2><b>Lifestyle Changes to Prevent Hair Fall</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Lifestyle Changes to Prevent Hair Fall" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Lifestyle_Changes_to_Prevent_Hair_Fall_480x480.jpg?v=1723030570"/></div>
<p><span>A final cause of hair loss due to lifestyle is a lack of sleep. Your body requires adequate sleep to produce adult stem cells, and stress from a lack of sleep can trigger hair loss. If your hair loss is caused by a lack of sleep, reducing stress and obtaining more sleep will help to reverse it.</span></p>
<h3><b>Managing Stress and Its Impact on Hair</b></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Gentle Hair Care Routine</b><span>: Apply a sulfate-free shampoo and moisturizing conditioner. Avoid using hot water to wash your hair; instead, use lukewarm or cool water. To avoid breakage, gently detangle your hair using a wide-tooth comb.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid Over-Styling</b><span>: Limit your use of heat styling tools like blow dryers, straighteners, and curling irons. Avoid tight hairstyles, which can pull on your hair and cause tension.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Regular Scalp Massage</b><span>: Use your fingers or a scalp massager to improve blood circulation and hair growth. Consider using warm oils such as coconut, olive, or castor oil during the massage to provide additional nourishment.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Protective Hairstyles</b><span>: Choose hairstyles that minimize hair manipulation and breakage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Regular Trims</b><span>: Trim your hair every 6 to 8 weeks to remove split ends and maintain hair health.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><b>Getting Adequate Sleep</b></h4>
<p><span>If you're having difficulties sleeping, hearing how vital it is might be frustrating. However, simple steps can boost your chances of getting a decent night's sleep. Check out the Wise Choices box for advice on how to sleep well every day. There are treatments available for many common sleep disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help many people with insomnia sleep better. Medication can also benefit certain people.  Many people with sleep apnea can benefit from using a CPAP machine. These pieces of equipment keep the airways open, allowing you to breathe. Other treatments may include custom mouthguards and lifestyle adjustments.</span></p>
<h4><b>Regular Exercise for Improved Hair Health</b></h4>
<p><span>Regular strength training exercises such as weightlifting, resistance training, and bodyweight workouts can improve blood circulation and hormonal balance, which are both necessary for healthy hair. It has been established that lifting weights increases testosterone levels, a hormone associated with hair growth.</span></p>
<h3><b>Hair Masks and Treatments</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Hair Masks and Treatments" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Hair_Masks_and_Treatments_480x480.jpg?v=1723030569"/></div>
<p><span>A hair mask is a deeply nourishing treatment that helps strengthen, moisturize, de-frizz, and restore dry, damaged, processed, or curly hair to its natural bounce and luster.</span></p>
<h4><b>Egg Mask for Protein Boost</b></h4>
<p><span>Eggs are a nutrient-dense superfood for hair. They contain vitamins A and E, biotin, folate, and proteins. Their yolks contain beneficial lipids that replace moisture and make hair strands healthier and more voluminous. They are a readily available and cost-effective source of energy.</span></p>
<h4><b>Yogurt and Honey Hair Mask</b></h4>
<p><span>Honey is a humectant that attracts moisture to the hair and gives it shine and gloss. Honey is also antimicrobial and beneficial to scalp health. When combined, yogurt and honey will hydrate your hair without weighing it down, and they will give your scalp a fresh start without causing irritation or needless stripping.</span></p>
<h4><b>Avocado and Banana Hair Pack</b></h4>
<p><span>To prepare, gather one avocado, honey, black castor oil, mayonnaise, two eggs, argan oil, and a banana. Blend this mixture until it is like a smoothie, and apply it to your hair. As with the previous masks, leave on for 20-30 minutes before washing with your usual shampoo and conditioner.</span></p>
<h3><b>Supplements for Hair Growth</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Supplements for Hair Growth" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Supplements_for_Hair_Growth_480x480.jpg?v=1723030570"/></div>
<p><span>B vitamins are vital for maintaining healthy hair. Biotin (vitamin B7), niacin (vitamin B3), and vitamin B12 are believed to be very good for hair development. Proposed to permit the manufacture of amino acids, which are required for the formation of keratin.</span></p>
<h4><b>Biotin for Stronger Hair</b></h4>
<p><span>Biotin deficiency can cause hair loss, however, supplements can help with hair growth. However, there is no proof that biotin pills can promote hair growth in people who do not have a deficiency. Biotin is an essential B vitamin that aids the body's absorption of energy and nutrients from carbs, proteins, and lipids.</span></p>
<h4><b>Fish Oil and Omega-3 Fatty Acids</b></h4>
<p><span>Fish oil contains omega-3 fatty acids, which nourish the hair follicles and encourage healthy hair development. It also reduces scalp inflammation, which can cause dandruff and dryness.</span></p>
<h4><b>Iron and Zinc for Hair Health</b></h4>
<p><span>Plant-based zinc obtained from guava leaf extracts strengthens hair follicles and nourishes hair roots. By adopting a plant-based diet and supplementing with biotin, iron, and zinc, you may tap into your body's natural potential for healthy hair and glowing skin.</span></p>
