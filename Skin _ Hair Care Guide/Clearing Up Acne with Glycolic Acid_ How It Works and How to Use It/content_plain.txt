Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) like glycolic acid are capable of treating acne and enhancing the overall health of the skin. Glycolic acid works by exfoliating the skin, deep cleaning the pores, promoting cell turnover, and having anti-inflammatory qualities. As each person's skin is different, it could take some time to observe the benefits. A dermatologist should be consulted if you have severe or persistent acne in order to receive a specialised treatment plan and advice.
What Is Glycolic Acid and How Does It Help Treat Acne?
A form of
alpha hydroxy acid (AHA)
generated from sugar cane is glycolic acid. Due to its exfoliating and skin-rejuvenating qualities, it is frequently used in skincare products. In order to encourage the shedding of dead skin cells and reveal younger, smoother skin underneath, glycolic acid dissolves the connections holding them together.
Glycolic acid
is useful for treating acne in a number of ways, including:
Exfoliation
: Glycolic acid helps prevent the accumulation of sebum, dirt, and bacteria that can cause acne breakouts by removing dead skin cells and clearing pores.
Unclogging pores
: Glycolic acid has the power to deeply penetrate the pores and dissolve the materials that can clog them. As a result, fewer blackheads, whiteheads, and other acne lesions are produced.
Sebum (oil) production balance
: Glycolic acid can assist in regulating sebum (oil) production in the skin. Excessive sebum production is a common cause of acne, so reducing it can help prevent future breakouts.
Smoothing skin texture
: Using glycolic acid on a regular basis can help improve the texture of acne-prone skin. It stimulates cell turnover and collagen production, reducing the appearance of
acne scars,
hyperpigmentation, and uneven skin tone.
Increasing skincare product penetration
: By removing the outermost layer of the skin, glycolic acid improves the penetration of other skincare products like serums and moisturisers. This may increase their effectiveness in treating acne and enhancing the health of the skin as a whole.
It's important to keep in mind that glycolic acid, particularly at higher concentrations, can irritate and cause sensitivity in the skin.  Starting with a lower concentration and progressively raising it as tolerated is advised. Additionally, because glycolic acid and other exfoliating products can make skin more sensitive to the sun, it's imperative to use sunscreen whenever you use them. It is advised to see a dermatologist for a customised treatment plan if your acne is severe or persistent.
How Glycolic Acid Helps Exfoliate Skin and Clear Out Pores
Glycolic acid, due to its unique properties and mechanisms of action, helps exfoliate the skin and clear out pores. This is how it works:
Chemical exfoliation
: The stratum corneum, or top layer of skin, can be penetrated by the small molecule glycolic acid. It functions by dissolving the bonds between dead skin cells, which frequently lead to clogged pores and acne. By breaking down these bonds, glycolic acid encourages the exfoliation of dead skin cells, exposing younger, smoother skin underneath.
Increased cell turnover
: Glycolic acid speeds up the ageing-related slowdown of the natural process of cell turnover. It promotes the shedding of old skin cells, which in turn promotes the growth of new cells. This turnover enhances the overall look and texture of the skin by clearing away debris and clogging pores.
Dissolving debris and sebum
: Glycolic acid is capable of penetrating the pores deeply. It has the ability to dissolve substances that can clog pores, such as excess sebum (oil), dirt, and other impurities. By effectively removing these pore-clogging substances, glycolic acid helps to prevent the formation of acne lesions such as blackheads and
whiteheads
.
Effects on inflammation
: Glycolic acid also has mild anti-inflammatory properties in addition to its exfoliating abilities. The severity of breakouts can be impacted by inflammation, which is important in the development of acne. By reducing inflammation, glycolic acid can help soothe existing acne lesions and prevent new ones from forming.
The combination of glycolic acid's exfoliating properties, accelerated cell turnover, capacity to dissolve dirt and sebum, and anti-inflammatory properties aids in pore cleaning, acne prevention, and skin condition improvement. Individual reactions to glycolic acid may differ, therefore, starting with lower concentrations and gradually increasing as tolerated is advised to reduce the risk of skin irritation.
Other Benefits of Glycolic Acid for Acne-Prone Skin
In addition to its pore-clearing and exfoliating abilities, glycolic acid has a number of additional advantages for skin that is prone to acne:
Reduction of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation
: Acne flare-ups frequently leave behind post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), a dark spot or discoloration. By encouraging skin cell turnover and accelerating the shedding of pigmented skin cells, glycolic acid aids in the fading of these marks. This can eventually result in a skin tone that is more even and a decrease in the visibility of PIH.
Acne scar smoothing
: Glycolic acid can also help to lessen the visibility of acne scars. Its exfoliating and cell turnover properties can help reduce the visibility of shallow acne scars caused by mild to moderate acne. It's important to keep in mind that glycolic acid may not have a significant effect on the appearance of deeper scars, which may require more sophisticated treatments.
Improved absorption of additional acne treatments
: Glycolic acid's exfoliating action can increase the absorption and effectiveness of additional acne treatments used topically. It improves the ability of these treatments to penetrate the skin by removing the top layer of dead skin cells, which increases their capacity to treat acne.
Rejuvenation of the entire skin
: Regular use of glycolic acid can aid in the rejuvenation of the entire skin. It promotes collagen synthesis, which can help to increase skin firmness and elasticity. The appearance of fine lines may be diminished, and the overall texture of the skin may be improved, which can be helpful for acne-prone skin.
Maintenance of clear skin
: Glycolic acid can still be helpful for acne-prone skin even after breakouts have been under control. Regular exfoliation aids in preventing the accumulation of dead skin cells, sebum, and other debris that can clog pores and cause further breakouts. A regular skincare routine that includes glycolic acid can help maintain clear, healthy-looking skin.
It's important to note that while glycolic acid can be beneficial for many individuals with acne-prone skin, everyone's skin is unique, and individual results may vary. It's advisable to start with lower concentrations of glycolic acid and gradually increase as tolerated while monitoring your skin for any signs of irritation or sensitivity. If you have severe or persistent acne, it's recommended that you consult a dermatologist for a personalised treatment plan.
How to Use Glycolic Acid to Combat Acne
To get the most out of glycolic acid's anti-acne effects and lower your risk of skin irritation, make sure to use it in accordance with the recommended dosage schedule. An overview of how to use glycolic acid for acne is provided below:
Start with a lower concentration
: It is best to start with a product with a lower concentration, such as 5% or 10%, if you are new to using glycolic acid or have sensitive skin. This lessens the likelihood of irritation while allowing your skin to gradually adjust to the acid. You can consider raising progressively the concentration if you'd like to, as your skin gets used to it.
Patch test
: Perform a patch test on a small, discrete area of your skin before using glycolic acid on your entire face. A small amount of the product should be applied, and you should watch for any unfavourable effects, such as redness, itching, or excessive dryness. It should be safe to use it on your face if there is no adverse reaction within 24 hours.
Face cleaning
: To remove any dirt, oil, or makeup, start by washing your face with a mild cleanser. Utilising a fresh towel, pat dry your skin.
How to use the glycolic acid product
: For detailed application instructions, refer to the product's packaging. Normally, you'd dab a little bit of the glycolic acid product onto your fingertips or a cotton pad and gently massage it into your clean, dry skin. Avoid touching the sensitive area around your eyes.
Start with a brief contact time
: If you have sensitive skin, it is advised to begin with a brief contact time. This entails applying the glycolic acid to your skin for a shorter period of time—perhaps just a few minutes—before washing it off with water. You can gradually extend the contact time to the suggested duration specified on the product packaging as long as your skin tolerates it well.
Follow with moisturiser
: After rinsing off the glycolic acid, apply a gentle moisturiser suitable for your skin type. This promotes skin barrier health and moisture replenishment. Look for formulas that aren't comedogenic (pore-clogging).
Sunscreen use is essential
: Since glycolic acid can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, it's important to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher during the day. This aids in shielding your skin from damaging UV rays and stops additional sun damage, which can exacerbate acne and cause hyperpigmentation.
Gradually increase frequency
: Begin by using glycolic acid once or twice a week and gradually increase the frequency as your skin tolerates. Keep an eye out for signs of irritation, redness, or excessive dryness on your skin. If you have any negative reactions, reduce the frequency of use or stop using completely.
Be patient and consistent
: Because the results of using glycolic acid for acne may take time, it's critical to be patient and consistent with your skincare routine. It may take several weeks to notice improvements in acne breakouts, skin texture, and overall complexion. Consistency is essential for achieving and maintaining desired outcomes.
Always remember to seek the advice of a dermatologist or skincare expert before introducing new products into your regimen, particularly if you suffer from severe or persistent acne. They can offer tailored advice based on your skin type, issues, and medical background.
Recognizing pH Concentrations and Levels for Effective Treatment
The pH scale, which spans from 0 to 14, determines how acidic or alkaline a thing is. While pH levels below 7 are considered acidic and pH values over 7 are considered alkaline, pH 7 is regarded as neutral. Natural skin pH values normally fall between 4.5 and 5.5, making them mildly acidic. For good skin function and barrier integrity, it's crucial to maintain the natural pH balance of the skin. The pH level has a significant impact on glycolic acid's effectiveness. At a pH range of 3 to 4, glycolic acid is most beneficial for exfoliation and skin benefits. It can penetrate the skin and deliver the desired exfoliating and rejuvenating benefits at this level of acidity. The pH level of any glycolic acid-containing skincare products should be noted on the container or in the product details. To obtain the best outcomes, it is typically advised to select items with a pH that falls within the useful range.
The quantity of an active ingredient, such as glycolic acid, in a product, is referred to as its concentration. Higher concentrations usually mean that there is more of the active substance present. Concentrations of glycolic acid in skincare products can range from 1% to 30% or more. To gently exfoliate skin and maintain healthy skin, everyday skincare products typically contain concentrations of 1% to 10%. Higher concentrations, such as 20% to 30% or higher, are frequently present in professional or medical-grade treatments and necessitate careful application and supervision by a skincare expert.
When choosing a glycolic acid product for acne treatment, it's critical to consider the sensitivity and tolerance of your skin. Start with lower dosages and gradually increase them as needed for people with sensitive or easily irritated skin. It's also vital to keep in mind that higher glycolic acid concentrations could call for shorter contact durations or only be used rarely to avoid overly irritated skin. Always adhere to the dosage and concentration recommendations provided by the product's manufacturer. A dermatologist or skincare expert can offer personalized advice depending on your skin type and needs if you are unsure or have concerns.
Incorporating Glycolic Acid into Your Skincare Routine for Best Results
The best results can be obtained by incorporating glycolic acid into your skincare regimen. Here's a how-to manual for using glycolic acid efficiently for the best results:
Determine your skin's sensitivity and tolerance
: Before beginning with glycolic acid, evaluate your skin's sensitivity and patience. If you have sensitive skin or are new to glycolic acid, start with lower concentrations and work up as tolerated.
Cleanse your face
: Begin your skincare routine by cleansing your face with a
gentle cleanser
appropriate for your skin type. This removes dirt, oil, and impurities from your skin, preparing it for glycolic acid application.
Use glycolic acid products in the evening
: Because glycolic acid products can increase your skin's sensitivity to the sun, it's best to use them in the evening. This reduces the likelihood of sunburn and other sun-related skin damage.
Begin with a toner or pre-soaked pad
: If you're using a glycolic acid-containing toner or pre-soaked pad, apply it to a cotton pad and gently swipe it over your cleansed face, avoiding the eye area. This exfoliates the skin and prepares it for additional treatment.
Apply glycolic acid serum or cream
: Apply a small amount of glycolic acid serum or cream to your fingertips and gently massage it into your skin in upward, circular motions. Concentrate on acne-prone areas or areas where you want to address skin concerns. Again, stay away from the sensitive eye region.
Gradually increase usage
: To give your skin time to adjust, start by using glycolic acid products two to three times per week. You can gradually increase the frequency as your skin becomes more accepting, up to daily usage if it is tolerated well. Pay attention to any symptoms of itchiness or excessive dryness and modify your usage as necessary.
Follow with moisturiser
: After applying glycolic acid, wait a few minutes for it to absorb, then follow up with a gentle, hydrating moisturiser. This promotes skin barrier health and moisture replenishment.
Apply sunscreen throughout the day
: Since glycolic acid can make skin more sensitive to the sun, it's essential to use a
broad-spectrum sunscreen
with an SPF of 30 or higher throughout the day. This shields your skin from UV rays that can worsen acne and speed up the ageing process as well as prevents
sun damage
.
Be consistent and patient
: When using glycolic acid, consistency is essential. To achieve the best results, incorporate it into your skincare routine on a regular basis. However, be patient because significant improvements in acne, texture, and overall complexion may take several weeks or even months.
Adapt usage based on the results
: Keep an eye on your skin's reaction to glycolic acid and adjust your application accordingly. Reduce the frequency or concentration of the product if you experience excessive dryness, irritation, or other adverse reactions. If you don't see the desired results, you could try increasing the concentration or frequency with the help of a dermatologist or skin care professional.
If you have any concerns or need clarification on incorporating glycolic acid into your skincare routine, consult with a dermatologist or skin care professional. They can give you personalised advice based on your skin type and concerns.
Combining Glycolic Acid with Other Acne-Fighting Ingredients
Your skincare regimen can work better if you combine glycolic acid with other anti-acne substances. Along with glycolic acid, the following substances can be used to treat acne:
Salicylic Acid
: A beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) that is particularly effective in treating acne is salicylic acid. It facilitates pore cleaning, skin exfoliation, and inflammation reduction.
Salicylic acid
can complement glycolic acid's exfoliating abilities and boost its pore-clearing effects when used together. In addition to glycolic acid products, think about using a salicylic acid cleanser, toner, or spot treatment.
Benzoyl peroxide
: This antimicrobial substance kills acne-causing bacteria and aids in the reduction of inflammation. It is frequently present in cleansers or spot treatments for acne. By focusing on both bacteria and exfoliation, the combination of
benzoyl peroxide
and glycolic acid can offer a dual-action approach to treating acne. However, because these ingredients can be drying and potentially irritating when combined, begin with lower concentrations and gradually increase as tolerated.
Retinoids
: Retinoids, such as retinol or prescription-strength retinoids like tretinoin, are
vitamin A
derivatives that help reduce acne breakouts. They aid in the unclogging of pores, the regulation of cell turnover, and the reduction of inflammation. Retinoids can increase the exfoliating and pore-clearing properties of glycolic acid when taken together, resulting in cleaner, smoother skin. Retinoids can cause dryness and sensitivity, so it's crucial to start using them gradually and watch how your skin reacts to them.
Tea tree oil
: Tea tree oil is a naturally occurring antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory substance that is well-known for its ability to treat acne. Both inflammation and acne-causing bacterial growth can be slowed down with its aid. Tea tree oil can increase the overall effectiveness of treating acne by acting as an additional antimicrobial benefit when combined with glycolic acid. Spot treatment with diluted tea tree oil may be used in conjunction with glycolic acid products.
Niacinamide
: Niacinamide, also referred to as vitamin B3, has numerous advantages for skin that is prone to acne. It lessens inflammation, regulates sebum production, and strengthens the skin's protective barrier. When combined with glycolic acid,
niacinamide
can help balance the effects of exfoliation and reduce potential irritation. For a combined approach to acne treatment, look for serums or moisturisers that contain both ingredients.
It's important to gradually introduce acne-fighting substances and monitor your skin's response when combining several of them. Start with smaller doses and alternate application days to see whether your skin can withstand the combination without becoming overly dry or irritated. Always follow the manufacturer's recommendations, and consider speaking with a dermatologist or skin care specialist to receive personalised advice based on your skin type and issues.
What to Expect When Using Glycolic Acid for Acne
It's important to know what to anticipate when using glycolic acid to treat acne. Here are some common side effects and considerations when using glycolic acid to treat acne:
Glycolic acid is an exfoliating agent that aids in the removal of dead skin cells, the opening of blocked pores, and the stimulation of skin cell renewal. You might experience some light skin peeling or flaking when you first start using glycolic acid. This is a typical aspect of exfoliation, which over time can result in a complexion that is smoother and clearer.
You can anticipate an improvement in your skin's texture with regular use of glycolic acid. It contributes to a more even skin tone by reducing post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, acne scarring, and rough skin.
Glycolic acid aids in pore-clearing and lessens the accumulation of bacteria, sebum, and dead skin cells that cause acne outbreaks. You might see a decrease in the frequency and severity of acne breakouts with continued use. It might take a few weeks or months to notice noticeable improvements, though individual results may vary.
Some people may experience momentary skin sensitivity when first starting to use glycolic acid. This may appear as a slight redness, stinging, or tingling. It's important to monitor your skin's response and adjust usage accordingly. It may be less sensitive, to begin with lower concentrations and increase them gradually.
Your skin may become more sun-sensitive due to glycolic acid. To shield your skin from damaging UV rays, wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher during the day. Sunburn, skin damage, and aggravation of acne-related hyperpigmentation can result from not wearing sunscreen.
Acne treatment with glycolic acid necessitates perseverance and consistency. It may take some time for you to notice visible improvements in your skin. The severity of your acne, your skin type, and the specific glycolic acid product used can all influence the outcome. Maintain a consistent skincare routine and give it time to work.
Glycolic acid is not a one-time cure for acne. To keep the benefits and avoid future breakouts, make glycolic acid a regular part of your skincare routine. Regular glycolic acid exfoliation can help keep your pores clear and your complexion healthy.
Keep in mind that everyone's skin is different, and glycolic acid sensitivities can vary. If you have severe or persistent acne, you should consult a dermatologist so that they can provide personalised advice and suggestions tailored to your specific needs.
Common Side Effects and How to Address Them
Although most people tolerate glycolic acid well, some may develop negative effects. Here are some typical adverse effects of glycolic acid and remedies for them:
Skin Irritation
: When using larger doses or starting with glycolic acid, some skin irritation, such as redness, stinging, or itching, can happen. As a remedy, you can:
Start with lower concentrations
: Increase glycolic acid concentrations gradually as tolerated, starting at a lower level (for example, 5% or 10%).
Patch test
: Before applying glycolic acid to your entire face, conduct a patch test on a small skin patch. This assists in detecting any adverse reactions.
Reduce frequency
: If irritation occurs, reduce the frequency with which glycolic acid is used. For example, reduce your application frequency from daily to every other day or a few times per week until your skin adjusts.
Dryness and flaking
: Glycolic acid, especially in the early stages of use, can temporarily cause dryness or flaking. This issue may be resolved by:
Moisturize
: After using glycolic acid, use a gentle, non-comedogenic moisturizer to help hydrate and soothe the skin.
Use occlusive products
: Consider applying occlusive products, such as a thin layer of petroleum jelly or facial oil as a barrier over the affected areas, to reduce moisture loss from the areas treated with glycolic acid.
Avert using additional products that might dry out your skin
: Avert using additional exfoliating agents or products with harsh ingredients or alcohol.
Sun Sensitivity
: Glycolic acid can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, which increases the risk of sunburn and other sun-related problems. You can fix this by:
Apply sunscreen
: Even on overcast days, slather on a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. Reapply frequently, especially if you plan to spend a lot of time outside.
Reduce your time spent in the sun
: Make an effort to spend as little time in the sun as possible, especially from 10 am to 4 pm. To protect your skin from the sun, seek out shade, dress in sun-safe clothing, and cover up with hats and sunglasses.
Hyperpigmentation or Darkening
: Glycolic acid, particularly in people with darker skin tones, can occasionally result in temporary hyperpigmentation or darkening of the skin. You can fix this by:
Reduce concentration or frequency
: Reduce the concentration of glycolic acid or the frequency with which it is used to give your skin time to adjust.
Use should be stopped if necessary
: If hyperpigmentation worsens or persists, stop using glycolic acid and seek advice from a dermatologist.
Stop using the product and get medical treatment from a dermatologist or other healthcare provider if you develop any severe or lingering side effects, including significant discomfort, blistering, or severe redness. It's important to remember that side effects are typically brief and frequently go away as your skin gets used to the glycolic acid treatment. To guarantee your skin's health, it's crucial to pay attention to your skin and modify your skincare regimen as necessary.
Results You Can Expect with Consistent Use
Regular glycolic acid use will have a lot of positive effects on skin that is prone to acne. It's important to keep in mind that individual results may vary based on factors like skin type, the severity of acne, and adherence to a skincare routine. You should anticipate the following results from regular use:
Reduced Acne Breakouts
: Glycolic acid aids in pore unclogging, excess oil removal, and exfoliation, all of which are common causes of acne breakouts. You might see a reduction in the frequency and severity of breakouts with continued use.
Better Skin Texture
: Glycolic acid encourages cellular turnover, which results in softer, smoother skin. You might observe improved skin texture, lessened roughness, and lessened acne scars or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation over time.
Brighter Skin
: Regular glycolic acid use can aid in the removal of dull and dead skin cells, revealing a lighter and more radiant skin tone. It can also help to even out skin tone by reducing the appearance of acne-related dark spots and discoloration.
Smaller Pores
: Glycolic acid can aid in lessening the appearance of enlarged pores by effectively exfoliating the skin and preventing clogs. With continued use, you might see your pores become less visible, giving your complexion a smoother, more refined appearance.
Enhanced Skincare Product Absorption
: Because glycolic acid removes dead skin cells and unclogs pores, it can improve the absorption and effectiveness of other skincare products. This allows serums, moisturisers, and spot treatments to penetrate deeper into the skin and more effectively deliver active ingredients.
Improved Skin Health
: Glycolic acid can help to improve overall skin health. Exfoliating the skin promotes a balanced complexion, reduces congestion, and aids in the maintenance of a healthier skin barrier. This can result in a more robust and vibrant appearance.
It's important to remember that results might not be apparent right away and that it might take a few weeks or even months to see observable improvements. Apply glycolic acid to your skin as directed and keep doing so because consistency is key when using it to get the results you want. A dermatologist or skincare specialist can provide personalised recommendations based on your particular skin type and issues, so it's always beneficial to speak with them if you have concerns or questions about your progress.
