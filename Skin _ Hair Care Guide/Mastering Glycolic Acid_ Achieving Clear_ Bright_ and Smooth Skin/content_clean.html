<p><span>Creating a regular skincare routine is an excellent way to keep your skin healthy and reduce the appearance of aging or damage. <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/glycolic-acid">Glycolic acid</a> is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that can benefit your skin in a variety of ways. Glycolic acid is a well-liked component of skin care products because it can exfoliate the skin and enhance its texture and appearance. It originates from sugar cane and is a member of the alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) chemical class. <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/the-ultimate-guide-to-removing-dead-skin-cells">Dead skin cells</a> are easily removed from the skin's surface because glycolic acid dissolves the bonds holding them together. This leads to a brighter, smoother complexion.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Science Behind Glycolic Acid and Its Skin Benefits</b></h2>
<div><img alt="The Science Behind Glycolic Acid and Its Skin Benefits" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/strawberry_leg_3_586bdc21-e208-4172-90a1-e3109a9b2196_480x480.jpg?v=1679740327"/></div>
<p><span>Glycolic acid is a naturally occurring compound found in certain fruits, beets, and sugarcane. In its purest form, it is colourless and odourless. Pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies use glycolic acid in topical products to treat skin conditions and enhance the texture and appearance of the skin. The acid used by cosmetic companies is usually obtained from a laboratory rather than from natural sources.</span></p>
<p><span> Here is a brief overview of the science behind glycolic acid and its skin benefits:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid works by breaking down the bonds between dead skin cells, which allows them to be easily removed from the surface of the skin. This process of exfoliation helps to reveal brighter, smoother, and more even-toned skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid also stimulates the production of collagen in the skin. Collagen is a protein that gives skin its strength and elasticity, and its production naturally declines with age. By <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/collagen-skin-treatment-benefits">promoting collagen</a> synthesis, glycolic acid can help to improve the overall texture and firmness of the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid has a small molecular size, which allows it to penetrate the skin deeply. This can help to hydrate the skin by attracting moisture and improving the skin's ability to retain it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid has been shown to <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/best-skin-barrier-creams">improve the skin's barrier</a> function, which helps to protect the skin from environmental damage and prevent moisture loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid can help to reduce the appearance of <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/fine-line-and-wrinkles">fine lines and wrinkles</a> by stimulating collagen production and exfoliating dead skin cells.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Overall, glycolic acid is a powerful ingredient that can help improve the texture, tone, and overall health of the skin. Its ability to exfoliate, stimulate collagen production, hydrate, improve skin barrier function, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles makes it a popular choice for skincare products. However, it's important to use glycolic acid responsibly and follow the recommended usage instructions to avoid any potential adverse effects.</span></p>

<h3><b>Unlocking Anti-Aging and Brightening Benefits with Glycolic Acid</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Unlocking Anti-Aging and Brightening Benefits with Glycolic Acid" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/209_4becc5fc-87f9-4fdb-9e2c-c6319a491eaa_480x480.png?v=1701157105"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Glycolic acid is a widely used component in skincare products that has <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/anti-ageing">anti-aging</a> and brightening properties. The skin is exfoliated with the help of an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) derived from sugarcane, revealing a lighter, more even skin tone.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are some ways that glycolic acid can help unlock anti-aging and brightening benefits:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid exfoliates the skin by breaking down the bonds between dead skin cells, allowing them to be easily removed. This helps to reveal fresher, younger-looking skin that has a more even texture.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid stimulates collagen production in the skin. Collagen is a protein that is essential for skin elasticity and firmness. As we age, our collagen production decreases, leading to <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/home-remedies-to-reduce-wrinkles-on-face">wrinkles</a> and sagging skin. By boosting collagen production, glycolic acid can help to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid can help to improve skin texture by smoothing out rough patches and reducing the appearance of <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/get-rid-of-acne-scars-and-blemishes">acne scars</a> and hyperpigmentation. This leads to a more even and radiant complexion.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid can also help to increase skin hydration by promoting the production of hyaluronic acid. This is a natural substance that helps to keep the skin plump and hydrated.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>By removing dead skin cells and smoothing out the skin's surface, glycolic acid can enhance the absorption of other skincare products. This means that any serums or creams applied after using glycolic acid will be better absorbed and therefore more effective.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>When using glycolic acid, it is important to start slowly and build up tolerance gradually. It is also essential to wear sunscreen during the day as glycolic acid can increase the skin's sensitivity to the sun. It is recommended to use glycolic acid products at night and to avoid using them in conjunction with other exfoliating products. </span></p>
<h3><b>Glycolic Acid for Hyperpigmentation and Scarring: What You Need to Know</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Glycolic Acid for Hyperpigmentation and Scarring: What You Need to Know" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/210_29dba830-fd6e-4fda-b2fd-aeb7ee29fecf_480x480.png?v=1701157134"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Glycolic acid is a popular ingredient in skincare products that can help to reduce the appearance of <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/types-of-skin-pigmentation">hyperpigmentation </a>and scarring. The condition known as hyperpigmentation, which can leave the skin with dark spots or patches, is brought on by an overproduction of melanin, the pigment that gives our skin its color. The skin's natural healing response to an injury, such as acne or a cut, results in scarring, which can leave behind noticeable marks.</span></p>
<p><span>Here's what you need to know about using glycolic acid for hyperpigmentation and scarring:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>As mentioned earlier, glycolic acid is an exfoliating ingredient that can help to remove dead skin cells and stimulate cell turnover. This can help to fade hyperpigmentation and reduce the appearance of scars by encouraging the growth of new, healthy skin cells.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid can also help to brighten the skin by removing dull, dead skin cells and revealing a brighter, more even complexion. This can help to reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation and make scars less noticeable.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid has been shown to stimulate collagen production in the skin. Collagen is a protein that is essential for skin elasticity and firmness. By boosting collagen production, glycolic acid can help to improve the texture and appearance of scars.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>When using glycolic acid for hyperpigmentation and scarring, it's important to start with a low concentration and gradually increase it as your skin builds tolerance. Using a high concentration of glycolic acid can cause skin irritation and make hyperpigmentation and scarring worse.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>It's essential to wear sunscreen when using glycolic acid as it can increase the skin's sensitivity to the sun. Sun exposure can worsen hyperpigmentation and scarring, so protecting your skin from the sun is important for achieving the best results.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It's important to note that glycolic acid may not work for everyone, and it's best to consult with a dermatologist or skincare professional to determine the best treatment plan for your specific skin concerns. They can also recommend other ingredients or treatments that may be more effective for your skin type and concerns.</span></p>

<p><span>Before applying glycolic acid to your entire face, do a patch test on a small area of your skin. Wait 24 hours to see if there is any redness, itching, or irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Start by using glycolic acid only once or twice a week, gradually increasing the frequency as your skin tolerates it. Avoid using glycolic acid products on consecutive days.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Apply glycolic acid after cleansing and toning your face, but before any moisturizer or other skincare products. Use a small amount of product and gently massage it into your skin with your fingertips. Avoid the eye area.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Follow with a moisturizer: After applying glycolic acid, moisturize your skin with a gentle, hydrating moisturizer. This will help to lock in moisture and prevent dryness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Use at night: Since glycolic acid can increase the skin's sensitivity to the sun, it is best to use it at night. If you must use it during the day, be sure to wear a sunscreen with at least SPF 30 to protect your skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Avoid other exfoliants: Do not use other exfoliating products, like scrubs or peels, while using glycolic acid. This can cause excessive irritation and damage to the skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It is also important to note that glycolic acid may not be suitable for all skin types, especially those with severe or active skin conditions like rosacea or eczema. Consult a dermatologist or other skincare specialist if you have any questions about whether glycolic acid is safe for you.</span></p>

<p><span>When using glycolic acid, it's crucial to take into account your <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/how-to-balance-skin-ph-level">skin's pH balance</a> because it affects how the acid reacts with your skin. When used at a pH of about 3.5, which is slightly acidic, glycolic acid performs best. However, using glycolic acid at a pH level that is too high or too low can irritate the skin and harm it. The following advice will help you make sure your pH balance is ideal:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Look for skincare products that disclose their pH level. The optimal pH range for glycolic acid is between 3 and 4, so look for products that fall within this range. Avoid products with a pH that is too low, which can cause skin irritation and damage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>A toner with a pH of around 5.5 can help to balance the pH of your skin after using glycolic acid. This can help to reduce the risk of irritation and redness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>After applying glycolic acid, wait a few minutes before applying other skincare products. This will give the acid time to fully penetrate and work on your skin without being neutralized by other products with a higher pH.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Avoid using alkaline products like bar soap, which can raise the pH of your skin and neutralize the effects of glycolic acid.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>If you're new to using glycolic acid, start with a low concentration and gradually build up to higher concentrations. This will give your skin time to adjust to the acid and help prevent irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>If you have sensitive skin or are unsure about how to use glycolic acid, consult with a skincare professional or dermatologist. They can help determine if glycolic acid is right for your skin and recommend products that are appropriate for your skin type.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>In summary, maintaining a pH balance is important when using glycolic acid. By using products with the appropriate pH, waiting before applying other products, and starting slowly, you can ensure that glycolic acid is safe and effective for your skin.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Concluding Thoughts: Achieving Clear, Bright, and Smooth Skin with Glycolic Acid</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img alt="Glycolic Acid for Clear, Bright, and Smooth Skin" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Images_Blog_Post_9_0cb96430-d543-4cf4-8b19-5d0f562b0678_480x480.png?v=1679740399"/></strong></p>
<p><span>In conclusion, glycolic acid is an effective component for achieving smooth, bright, and clear skin. It is a kind of alpha-hydroxy acid that improves skin texture by exfoliating the epidermis, reducing hyperpigmentation, and reducing wrinkles. However, it's crucial to use glycolic acid responsibly and safely, particularly if you have delicate skin. Start with a low concentration and start using glycolic acid sparingly to incorporate it into your skincare regimen. As your skin gets used to the acid, gradually increase the frequency and concentration. Use a moisturizer after applying sunscreen and always use one to protect your skin from sun damage.</span></p>
<p><span>To make sure glycolic acid is efficient and secure for your skin, it's also crucial to maintain a pH balance.  Use a pH-balancing toner, look for products with a pH between 3 and 4, and stay away from alkaline products that can make your skin more alkaline. To get the best results from glycolic acid, keep in mind to be patient and consistent with your skincare regimen. With careful application and safety measures, glycolic acid can be a useful tool in your skincare toolbox, assisting you in achieving the clear, radiant, and smooth skin you desire.</span></p>
