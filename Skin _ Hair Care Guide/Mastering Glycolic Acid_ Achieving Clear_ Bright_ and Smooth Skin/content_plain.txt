Creating a regular skincare routine is an excellent way to keep your skin healthy and reduce the appearance of aging or damage.
Glycolic acid
is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that can benefit your skin in a variety of ways. Glycolic acid is a well-liked component of skin care products because it can exfoliate the skin and enhance its texture and appearance. It originates from sugar cane and is a member of the alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) chemical class.
Dead skin cells
are easily removed from the skin's surface because glycolic acid dissolves the bonds holding them together. This leads to a brighter, smoother complexion.
The Science Behind Glycolic Acid and Its Skin Benefits
Glycolic acid is a naturally occurring compound found in certain fruits, beets, and sugarcane. In its purest form, it is colourless and odourless. Pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies use glycolic acid in topical products to treat skin conditions and enhance the texture and appearance of the skin. The acid used by cosmetic companies is usually obtained from a laboratory rather than from natural sources.
Here is a brief overview of the science behind glycolic acid and its skin benefits:
Glycolic acid works by breaking down the bonds between dead skin cells, which allows them to be easily removed from the surface of the skin. This process of exfoliation helps to reveal brighter, smoother, and more even-toned skin.
Glycolic acid also stimulates the production of collagen in the skin. Collagen is a protein that gives skin its strength and elasticity, and its production naturally declines with age. By
promoting collagen
synthesis, glycolic acid can help to improve the overall texture and firmness of the skin.
Glycolic acid has a small molecular size, which allows it to penetrate the skin deeply. This can help to hydrate the skin by attracting moisture and improving the skin's ability to retain it.
Glycolic acid has been shown to
improve the skin's barrier
function, which helps to protect the skin from environmental damage and prevent moisture loss.
Glycolic acid can help to reduce the appearance of
fine lines and wrinkles
by stimulating collagen production and exfoliating dead skin cells.
Overall, glycolic acid is a powerful ingredient that can help improve the texture, tone, and overall health of the skin. Its ability to exfoliate, stimulate collagen production, hydrate, improve skin barrier function, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles makes it a popular choice for skincare products. However, it's important to use glycolic acid responsibly and follow the recommended usage instructions to avoid any potential adverse effects.
