Acne is a common skin condition that affects people of all ages and genders. However, women often experience changes in their skin during their menstrual cycle. This change in skin is commonly referred to as period pimples or hormonal acne.
Acne and menstrual cycle
The menstrual cycle is a complex process that involves several
hormonal changes
in a woman's body. During the menstrual cycle, the levels of oestrogen and
progesterone
fluctuate, leading to changes in the skin. These hormonal changes can cause an increase in
sebum
production, leading to
clogged pores
and
acne
breakouts.
Understanding hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle
The menstrual cycle is a complex process in which various hormonal changes prepare the female body for pregnancy. Here's a brief overview of the main hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle.
Follicular Phase (Days 1-14)
: The pituitary gland secretes follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulates the growth of follicles in the ovaries. As the follicles grow, they produce estrogen, which helps thicken the uterine lining (endometrium) in preparation for implantation of a fertilized egg. The release of a mature egg from the ovary is known as ovulation, and it is caused by a spike in the hormone luteinizing hormone (LH).
Ovulation (Around Day 14)
: The release of the mature egg from the ovary, which signifies ovulation, is caused by an increase in LH levels.
Luteal Phase (Days 15-28)
: Progesterone is secreted by the corpus luteum, a structure that develops from the ruptured follicle following ovulation. In addition to maintaining the uterine lining, progesterone gets it ready for potential implantation. Estrogen levels also remain elevated during this phase, supporting the maintenance of the endometrium. The corpus luteum degenerates, leading to a decline in progesterone and estrogen levels. This drop in hormones triggers menstruation, the shedding of the uterine lining. The embryo releases human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which signals the corpus luteum to continue producing progesterone and estrogen, thus maintaining the uterine lining and supporting pregnancy.
The menstrual cycle, which usually lasts 28 days, though variations are common, is driven by these hormonal fluctuations. Understanding these changes can help people track their menstrual cycles, identify fertile days, and manage symptoms caused by hormonal fluctuations.
Hormonal contraceptives and their impact on acne
Hormonal contraceptives can have a positive or negative impact on acne, depending on the individual and the type of contraception used. Here's how hormonal contraceptives can affect acne.
Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs)
: COCs contain oestrogen and progesterone. They work by inhibiting ovulation and regulating hormone levels. Many women find that COCs can help with acne by reducing androgen production. Androgens are hormones that stimulate the sebaceous glands, causing increased oil production and acne. The estrogen component of COCs can also help regulate menstrual cycles and reduce hormonal fluctuations, which may contribute to acne flare-ups
Progestin-Only Contraceptives
: Progestin-only contraceptives, such as the mini-pill, contraceptive implants, and hormonal IUDs, can have varying effects on acne. Some progestins have anti-androgenic properties, which can help with acne by reducing sebum production. However, other progestins may have androgenic properties, which could aggravate acne in some people.
Anti-Androgenic Medications
: In some cases, healthcare providers may prescribe specific hormonal contraceptives for their anti-androgenic properties to help manage acne. These contraceptives contain progestins with strong anti-androgenic effects, which can effectively reduce acne lesions by decreasing sebum production and blocking androgen receptors.
Individual Variation
: It's important to note that responses to hormonal contraceptives can vary widely among individuals. While some women may experience improvements in acne with certain contraceptives, others may notice no change or even worsening of acne.
Managing acne during puberty and menopause
Acne management during puberty and menopause requires distinct approaches due to the underlying hormonal changes associated with each life stage. Here are some tips for managing acne during puberty and menopause:
Puberty:
To remove excess oil, dirt, and bacteria from the skin, cleanse it twice a day with a gentle
cleanser
. Use
non-comedogenic
(non-pore-clogging) skincare products to avoid exacerbating acne.
Over-the-counter topical treatments with benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or retinoids can help unclog pores and reduce acne lesions. Apply these treatments as directed, typically once or twice a day.
Encourage a healthy diet full of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid excessive consumption of high-glycemic index foods and sugary snacks, which may contribute to acne. Maintain good hygiene practices, such as regularly washing hair and avoiding touching or picking at acne lesions.
If over-the-counter treatments are ineffective, a dermatologist can prescribe stronger topical medications or oral medications like oral antibiotics or isotretinoin (Accutane) for severe acne. They may also recommend procedures like chemical peels or laser therapy for stubborn acne or acne scarring.
Menopause:
For women experiencing significant hormonal fluctuations and acne during menopause, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may be an option. HRT can help stabilize hormone levels and alleviate symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats, which may indirectly impact acne.
Similar to puberty, topical treatments containing ingredients like retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, or salicylic acid can help manage acne during menopause. However, the choice of products may need to be adjusted based on changes in skin sensitivity that often occur during menopause.
Oral medications like oral antibiotics or oral contraceptives (for non-menopausal women) may be prescribed by a dermatologist to help control acne during menopause. Isotretinoin (Accutane) may also be considered for severe, treatment-resistant acne, although it's typically used with caution in older adults due to potential side effects.
Use a gentle, non-comedogenic
moisturizer
to keep the skin hydrated, as menopausal skin tends to become drier. Apply
sunscreen
daily to protect the skin from UV damage and prevent post-inflammatory
hyperpigmentation
, which can occur with acne lesions.
If acne persists or worsens despite home care efforts, it's essential to
consult a dermatologist
for personalized treatment recommendations tailored to the individual's needs and skin type.
Acne management during puberty and menopause may require patience and persistence, as it can take time to find the most effective combination of treatments. Furthermore, any underlying hormonal imbalances or changes must be addressed under the supervision of a healthcare professional.
Symptoms of period acne
Period pimples are similar to other forms of acne, but they often occur in specific areas of the face. They are typically characterised by red, inflamed pimples that appear around the time of a woman's menstrual cycle.
Types of Lesions
: Hormonal acne can manifest as various types of lesions, including:
Papules: Small, red bumps.
Pustules: Red bumps with pus at the center.
Nodules: Large, painful, solid lesions deep within the skin.
Cysts: Deep, painful, pus-filled lesions that can cause scarring.
Inflammation and Sensitivity
: Hormonal acne lesions are often inflamed, tender, and sensitive to touch. The skin surrounding the acne may appear red and irritated.
Recurrence
: Hormonal acne tends to recur in a cyclical pattern, with flare-ups coinciding with the menstrual cycle. While some individuals may only experience acne during specific times of their menstrual cycle, others may have persistent hormonal acne throughout the month.
Other Symptoms
: Hormonal fluctuations associated with period acne may coincide with other premenstrual symptoms, such as mood swings, bloating, breast tenderness, and fatigue.
Identifying common symptoms of period-related acne
Period-related acne, also known as hormonal acne, frequently displays signs that correspond to the menstrual cycle. Timing, location, types of lesions, persistent breakouts, other symptoms, and exacerbating factors are some of the most typical symptoms to look for when diagnosing period-related acne. It's crucial to remember that, while these symptoms may indicate period-related acne, other variables can also contribute to acne development. If you have persistent or severe acne, you should see a dermatologist or healthcare practitioner for an accurate diagnosis and a personalised treatment plan. They can help identify the underlying causes of acne and offer effective therapies to alleviate symptoms.
Differentiating between period acne and other types of acne
Differentiating between period acne (hormonal acne) and other types of acne can be difficult because acne has many causes and triggers. However, some factors can help differentiate period acne from other types.
Timing
: Period acne appears cyclically, usually around the time of menstruation. If acne consistently worsens in the days before menstruation and then improves, it could be a sign of hormonal acne.
Location
: Hormonal acne typically appears on the lower half of the face, particularly around the chin, jawline, neck, and upper back. Other types of acne may occur on different areas of the face, such as the forehead, nose, and cheeks.
Lesion Types
: Hormonal acne can manifest as deep, painful cysts or nodules, which are more common in adult women. These lesions may respond less to over-the-counter treatments than other types of acne. Other types of acne, such as acne vulgaris, can present with a variety of lesions on the face and body, including whiteheads, blackheads, papules, and pustules.
Hormonal Factors
: Hormonal acne is strongly linked to fluctuations in hormone levels, particularly androgens (male hormones such as testosterone). It frequently appears during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause. Other causes of acne may include genetics, stress, diet, skincare products, and environmental factors.
Other Premenstrual Symptoms
: In addition to period acne, you may experience mood swings, bloating, breast tenderness, and fatigue. Other types of acne may not have a clear link to the menstrual cycle and may develop independently of hormonal fluctuations.
Medical History and Hormonal Imbalance
: Individuals with a history of hormonal imbalances, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), may be predisposed to hormonal acne. Certain medical conditions and medications can also affect hormone levels, contributing to acne development.
If you are not sure if your acne is caused by your menstrual cycle, or if you have persistent or severe acne, you should see a dermatologist or healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and personalised treatment plan. They can help identify the underlying causes of acne and recommend effective treatments to alleviate symptoms.
Psychological effects of period acne on self-esteem
Period acne can have a significant psychological impact on self-esteem, which varies depending on individual experiences and acne severity. Here are some common psychological consequences:
Negative Body Image
: Period acne can cause dissatisfaction with one's appearance, especially if it is severe or persistent. Individuals may be self-conscious about their skin and have a negative self-image.
Social Withdrawal
: Some people with period acne may avoid social situations or activities where their skin is more visible, such as parties, gatherings, or photoshoots, out of concern for their appearance. This can cause feelings of isolation or loneliness.
Low Self-Esteem
: Acne can impact self-esteem and self-worth, especially during adolescence when peer acceptance and social validation are particularly important. Persistent or severe acne may contribute to feelings of inadequacy or worthlessness.
Anxiety and Depression
: Chronic stress and anxiety from acne can exacerbate feelings of depression or anxiety, resulting in emotional distress and a lower quality of life. Acne-related anxiety can manifest as obsessive thoughts about one's appearance or persistent worry about future breakouts.
Impact on Relationships
: Acne can disrupt relationships with family, friends, and love partners. Some people may feel embarrassed or ashamed to be seen without makeup, resulting in strained relationships or trouble making new connections.
Academic and Career Concerns
: Acne-related self-esteem concerns can spread to academic or professional contexts, affecting confidence, performance, and career goals. Fear of being judged or discriminated against because of one's appearance might hinder academic performance or career development.
Seeking Treatment
: While some people use makeup or skincare products to cover or minimise the look of acne, others see dermatologists or healthcare practitioners to address the underlying reasons for acne and boost self-esteem.
Where are period acne located
Period pimples can occur in various parts of the face, but they are most commonly found in the following areas:
Lower Face
: Period acne is most commonly found on the chin. Acne can appear as small bumps, red pimples, or deep cysts. The jawline is another common location for hormonal acne. Breakouts along the jawline could be more inflamed and cystic.
Jawline
: Hormonal acne can extend along the jawline, often presenting as larger, tender cysts or nodules. These lesions may be deep-seated and more challenging to treat.
Neck
: Acne may also extend down the neck, particularly along the sides or back of the neck. These breakouts may appear similar to those on the face, including papules, pustules, and cysts.
Upper Back and Chest
: While facial acne is most common, hormonal acne can also affect the upper back and chest. Breakouts in these areas may be more inflammatory and resistant to treatment.
Hairline
: In certain cases, hormonal acne can spread to the hairline, particularly on the forehead and temples. This region may have more dispersed and smaller acne lesions.
It is important to note that, while period acne typically affects specific areas of the face and body, individual experiences may differ. Some people may only have acne in one or two of these areas, whereas others may have breakouts in several. Additionally, acne can occur in areas not typically associated with hormonal fluctuations, such as the cheeks, forehead, and nose.
Exploring common areas where period acne tends to occur
Period acne, also known as hormonal acne, tends to occur in specific areas of the face due to hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle. Here are the common areas where period acne tends to occur:
The chin is one of the most common locations for period acne. Hormonal fluctuations, especially an increase in androgen levels, can stimulate the sebaceous glands in this area, leading to excess oil production and acne formation.
Hormonal acne often appears along the jawline, typically in the form of cystic or nodular acne. These deep, painful lesions can be more challenging to treat and may leave behind scars.
Acne may also appear on the lower cheeks, especially near the jawline. Hormonal factors, like those found on the chin and jawline, play a role in acne development here.
Hormonal acne can spread to the neck, particularly on the sides and back. Although this area is less prone to breakouts, hormonal fluctuations can still have an impact.
While facial acne is more common, hormonal acne can also occur in the upper back and chest. Breakouts in these areas may be more inflammatory and difficult to treat.
Acne can develop along the hairline, especially around the temples and forehead. Hormonal changes can affect the hair follicles in this area, resulting in clogged pores and acne breakouts.
Understanding the significance of acne location in diagnosis
The importance of acne location in diagnosis lies in determining the potential underlying causes and contributing factors to acne development. While acne can appear anywhere on the body where there are hair follicles and sebaceous glands, the location of acne lesions can reveal important information about the specific factors causing acne formation. Here's how acne location can influence diagnosis:
Hormonal Acne vs. Non-Hormonal Acne
: Acne primarily affects the lower face, including the chin, jawline, and neck, and is frequently associated with hormonal fluctuations such as those that occur during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause. This type of acne is often referred to as hormonal acne. Acne on other parts of the face, such as the forehead, nose, and cheeks, may have different underlying causes, including genetics, environmental factors, skincare products, diet, and lifestyle habits.
Acne Mechanica
: Acne mechanica is a type of acne caused by friction, pressure, or occlusion. This type of acne frequently appears in areas with repeated friction or pressure, such as the forehead (from wearing hats or helmets), the chin (from resting the chin on the hands), or the back and chest (from tight clothing or backpack straps).
Comedonal Acne vs. Inflammatory Acne
: Comedonal acne, which is distinguished by non-inflamed lesions such as whiteheads and blackheads, may be more prevalent in certain areas, such as the brow and nose. Inflammatory acne, which includes papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts, can appear anywhere but is more common on the face, chest, and back, where sebaceous glands are densely concentrated.
Acne Variants
: Certain types of acne, such as acne conglobata (a severe form of inflammatory acne with interconnected nodules and cysts) and acne keloidalis nuchae (a type of acne that appears on the back of the neck), have distinct locations that aid in diagnosis.
Secondary Causes
: Acne in specific areas may indicate underlying medical conditions or external factors that contribute to acne development. For example, hormonal imbalances (such as polycystic ovary syndrome) can cause acne on the upper back and chest, whereas certain skincare products or medications can aggravate acne on the face.
By taking into account the location of acne lesions, as well as other clinical factors, healthcare providers can better assess the underlying causes of acne and tailor treatment plans to meet individual needs. Furthermore, understanding the importance of acne location can assist individuals in identifying potential triggers and making informed skincare and lifestyle decisions to manage and prevent acne outbreaks.
Addressing myths and misconceptions about acne location
Addressing myths and misconceptions about acne location can help people gain a better understanding of the condition and develop more effective treatment strategies. Here are some popular myths and misconceptions:
Myth
: Acne appears only on the face.
Reality
: While facial acne is common, it can also appear on other parts of the body, such as the neck, chest, back, shoulders, and buttocks. Hormonal fluctuations, friction, sweat, and pore-clogging chemicals are all potential causes of acne in these locations.
Myth
: Acne on specific areas of the face indicates underlying health issues.
Reality
: Although some forms of acne, like hormonal acne and polycystic ovarian syndrome, may be linked to underlying medical disorders, the location of acne is not a reliable indicator of internal health problems. Genetics, hormones, skincare habits, diet, and lifestyle can all contribute to acne development.
Myth
: Acne in certain areas of the face corresponds to specific organs or body systems.
Reality
: There is no scientific evidence to support the concept of "face mapping," which holds that acne in specific areas of the face is related to the health of specific organs or body systems. Acne location is mostly determined by sebum production, hair follicle density, and environmental exposures, not internal organ health.
Myth
: Acne only affects oily or dirty skin.
Reality
: Excess oil production and poor hygiene are not the only causes of acne. Acne is a multifactorial condition caused by genetics, hormones, inflammation, bacterial overgrowth, and skin barrier function. Acne can affect people with dry or sensitive skin as well.
Myth
: Acne along the chin and jawline is always hormonal.
Reality
: While hormonal fluctuations are commonly linked to acne on the chin and jawline, other factors such as friction, skincare products, diet, and lifestyle habits can also contribute to acne development. Hormonal acne is just one potential cause among many.
Myth
: Acne is purely a cosmetic issue that does not require medical attention.
Reality
: Acne can have a significant physical, emotional, and psychological impact on people's health. It can cause scarring, hyperpigmentation, pain, discomfort, and low self-esteem. Effective treatment options exist, and consulting a dermatologist or healthcare provider can help manage acne and reduce its impact on quality of life.
By debunking these myths and misconceptions, people can gain a better understanding of acne and make more informed decisions about prevention and treatment. It is critical to consult with a healthcare professional for personalised advice and treatment options tailored to your specific needs.
Period acne treatment
There are several treatment options available for period pimples, including over-the-counter
acne treatments
,
prescription medications
, and lifestyle changes.
Medical treatments for period acne, also known as hormonal acne, are designed to regulate hormone levels, reduce inflammation, unclog pores, and prevent bacterial overgrowth. Here is a summary of common medical treatments:
Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs)
: COCs contain both oestrogen and progestin hormones, and they are effective at regulating hormonal fluctuations that cause acne. They work by inhibiting ovulation, lowering androgen levels, and regulating hormone levels throughout the menstrual cycle. COCs are frequently used as the first-line treatment for hormonal acne in women who are not trying to conceive.
Anti-Androgen Medications
: Anti-androgen medications inhibit the effects of androgens (male hormones) on the skin, lowering sebum production and preventing acne. Spironolactone is a popular anti-androgen medication used to treat hormonal acne, especially in adult women. Other medications, including cyproterone acetate, flutamide, and finasteride, can be used to block androgen receptors or reduce androgen production.
Topical Retinoids
: Vitamin A derivatives such as tretinoin, adapalene, and tazarotene help prevent acne by increasing cell turnover, reducing inflammation, and preventing comedone formation. They work on both comedonal and inflammatory acne lesions and can be used alone or in conjunction with other acne treatments.
Topical Benzoyl Peroxide
: Benzoyl peroxide is a topical medication with antibacterial properties that helps unclog pores by reducing the number of acne-causing bacteria (Propionibacterium acnes) and eliminating excess oil. It is available over the counter in a variety of strengths and formulations, and it is frequently used as the first line of treatment for mild to moderate acne.
Topical Antibiotics
: Clindamycin and erythromycin are topical antibiotics that are applied to the skin to reduce inflammation and destroy acne-causing bacteria. They are frequently used in conjunction with other acne treatments to prevent bacterial resistance.
Oral Antibiotics
: Oral antibiotics such as tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline are used to treat moderate to severe inflammatory acne by reducing inflammation and eliminating bacteria. They are commonly used in short-term treatment courses to reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance.
Isotretinoin (Accutane)
: Isotretinoin is an effective oral medication for treating severe, nodular, or cystic acne that has not responded to other treatments. It works by lowering sebum production, preventing clogged pores, and reducing inflammation. Isotretinoin is extremely effective, but it is associated with potential side effects that must be carefully monitored by a dermatologist.
Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)
: Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may be prescribed to women suffering from hormonal imbalances caused by menopause to regulate hormone levels and improve acne symptoms.
Lifestyle modifications and home remedies for managing period acne
In addition to medical treatments, lifestyle changes and home remedies can help manage and reduce the severity of period acne. Here are a few effective strategies:
Maintain a Healthy Diet
: Eat a well-balanced diet that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Limit your intake of high-glycemic index foods and sugary snacks, as these can aggravate acne by increasing insulin levels and inflammation.

Establishing a consistent skincare routine tailored to hormonal fluctuations
Setting up a consistent skincare routine that is tailored to hormonal fluctuations can help you manage period acne and keep your skin healthy throughout the menstrual cycle. Here's a custom skincare routine:
Morning Routine
:
Start your day by cleansing your skin with a gentle, non-comedogenic cleanser to remove dirt, oil, and impurities accumulated overnight. Look for a cleanser with ingredients like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to target acne.
If you prefer using a toner, choose one that is alcohol-free and contains soothing ingredients like witch hazel or rose water. This can help balance the skin's pH and remove any remaining traces of dirt or cleanser.
Apply a targeted treatment, such as a benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid spot treatment, to any active acne lesions. Be sure to follow the instructions provided by the product.
Hydrate your skin with a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer to maintain hydration without clogging pores. Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid or glycerin for added hydration.
Finish your morning routine with a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. Choose a non-comedogenic formula to protect your skin from UV damage without causing breakouts.
Evening Routine
:
Begin your evening routine with a double cleanse to thoroughly remove makeup, sunscreen, and impurities. Start with an oil-based cleanser to dissolve makeup and follow up with a water-based cleanser to cleanse the skin.
Exfoliate your skin 1-3 times per week with a gentle chemical exfoliant containing ingredients like glycolic acid or lactic acid. This helps remove dead skin cells, unclog pores, and promote cell turnover.
Apply any acne treatments, serums, or prescription medications recommended by your dermatologist to target acne and prevent breakouts.
Follow up with a hydrating moisturizer to replenish moisture and soothe the skin. Choose a thicker, more emollient moisturizer for nighttime use if your skin tends to be dry.
Consider using an overnight mask or spot treatment containing ingredients like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or sulfur to target acne while you sleep.
Throughout the Menstrual Cycle
:
Keep track of your menstrual cycle and hormonal fluctuations to anticipate changes in your skin and adjust your skincare routine accordingly.
If you notice an increase in acne breakouts during certain times of the month, increase the frequency of spot treatments or incorporate additional acne-fighting ingredients into your routine.
Consistency is key to seeing results with any skincare routine. Stick to your routine even when your skin is clear to maintain its health and prevent future breakouts.
Stress management techniques and their impact on hormonal balance
Stress management techniques can help maintain hormonal balance, which can affect many aspects of health, including skin health and acne. Here are some stress management techniques and their potential effects on hormonal balance:
Mindfulness Meditation
: Mindfulness meditation entails focusing on the present moment without judgement, which can help reduce stress and increase relaxation. According to research, mindfulness meditation may reduce cortisol levels, the body's primary stress hormone, while also improving overall hormonal balance.
Deep Breathing Exercises
: Deep breathing exercises, such as diaphragmatic breathing or belly breathing, can activate the body's relaxation response and lower stress hormone levels, such as cortisol. Regular practice of deep breathing exercises can help regulate the autonomic nervous system and promote hormonal balance.
Yoga
: Yoga combines physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation to help people relax, reduce stress, and improve their overall well-being. Frequent yoga practice has been linked to improved hormonal balance, lower cortisol levels, and higher levels of feel-good hormones like dopamine and serotonin.
Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)
: PMR involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in the body to release physical tension and induce a state of relaxation. Regular use of PMR can help reduce stress, lower cortisol levels, and promote hormonal balance.
Regular Exercise
: Regular physical activity, such as aerobics, strength training, or yoga, can help relieve stress and improve mood. Exercise causes the release of endorphins, which are natural mood boosters that may help regulate cortisol levels and promote hormonal balance.
Healthy Lifestyle Habits
: Maintaining a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, staying hydrated, and avoiding excessive coffee and alcohol intake are all critical components of stress management and hormonal balance. These lifestyle choices promote general health and well-being, which can improve hormone control.
Social Support
: Seeking help from friends, family, or a support group can help alleviate feelings of isolation and provide emotional support during times of stress. Social support has been shown to mitigate the effects of stress on hormonal balance and increase resilience.
Time Management and Prioritization
: Learning effective time management techniques and prioritising tasks can help you feel less overwhelmed and stressed. By managing workload and responsibilities effectively, individuals can minimize chronic stress and support hormonal balance.
Conclusion: Navigating Period Acne with Confidence
Navigating period acne with confidence necessitates a multifaceted approach that addresses both the physical and emotional aspects of acne treatment. Individuals can take control of their skin health and boost their confidence in their appearance by understanding the hormonal fluctuations that cause period acne and implementing effective strategies.
