</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Exfoliation</strong><span><strong>:</strong> <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/scrub">Exfoliation</a> should be incorporated into your routine to remove dead skin cells and promote skin renewal. 1-2 times per week, use a mild chemical exfoliant (e.g., glycolic acid, lactic acid) or a gentle physical exfoliant.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Serum</strong><span><strong>:</strong> To target dark spots and brighten your complexion, use a serum containing ingredients such as <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-vitamin-c3-serum">vitamin C</a>, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-nia-serum">niacinamide</a>, or alpha arbutin.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span>Your wedding is and should be all about you- the beautiful bride with glowing skin. There are so many things that need to be taken care of before the big day. Taking care of your skin mostly takes a backseat. There’s no denying that good makeup will ensure that you look your best on your wedding day by hiding blemishes or scars. But nothing beats healthy-looking and naturally radiant skin. The months before the wedding are very hectic, and a lot of running around happens. This leaves you with significantly less time to take care of your skin. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a skincare routine that is easy to follow. You can find a lot of salons and clinics offering skin treatments and pre-bridal packages that guarantee glowing skin. But the makeup will work even better if you’ve got healthy skin.</span></p>

<h3><b>Common skincare myths debunked </b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Common skincare myths debunked" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/102_21418f97-fe23-4eea-a8e3-58c40fdd164a_480x480.png?v=1699958227"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Several common skincare myths persist, despite the fact that they are founded on misinformation or misunderstanding. Here are some myths that have been debunked:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Myth 1: </strong>You should always wash your face with hot water<span>.</span> Debunked<span>: Hot water can strip the skin's natural oils, causing dryness and irritation. It's best to use lukewarm water to cleanse your face to avoid this.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Myth 2<span>:</span> </b>Every day, skin exfoliation is necessary<span>.</span> Debunked<span>:</span><b><span> For most skin types, daily exfoliation can be too harsh and result in over-exfoliation, redness, and sensitivity.  At most, two to three times a week should be spent exfoliating.</span></b></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Myth 3:</strong> Natural ingredients are consistently efficient and safe<span>. </span>Debunked<span>: Not all natural remedies are safe or effective, even though many natural ingredients have positive effects on the skin. Some natural ingredients can cause allergic reactions, irritation, or other negative side effects.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Myth 4:</strong> On cloudy days, you do not need sunscreen<span>.</span> Debunked<span>: UV rays can penetrate clouds, and your skin is still vulnerable to UV damage even on cloudy days. Regardless of the weather, wearing sunscreen every day is imperative.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Myth 5: </strong>You cannot close or open pores<span>.</span> Debunked<span>: Pores are immobile and unable to open or close. The appearance of pores can be reduced with proper skincare, but their size does not change.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Myth 6: </strong>Skincare Products Must Cause a Tingling Sensation. Debunked<span>: A tingling sensation does not always indicate that a product is effective. In fact, it can be a sign of annoyance. Skincare products should be gentle and easy on the skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Myth 7: </strong>Expensive products are always superior<span>. </span>Debunked<span>: The cost of a skin care product does not always correspond to its effectiveness. There are numerous low-cost skincare options that are effective. What matters is that you find products that are appropriate for your skin type and address your specific concerns.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Myth 8: </strong>If you have dark skin, you do not need sunscreen<span>.</span> Debunked<span>: UV rays can harm all skin types and tones. People with darker skin can still get sunburned and develop skin cancer. Everyone needs to wear sunscreen.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Myth 9:</strong> Moisturiser is not necessary for oily skin<span>. </span>Debunked<span>: Moisturising is necessary even if you have oily skin. Skipping moisturiser can result in increased oil production as your skin attempts to compensate for the dryness.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Myth 10:</strong> To get rid of acne, you must dry out acne-prone skin<span>. </span>Debunked<span>: Drying out your skin can aggravate acne problems. Using harsh, drying products can cause irritation and increase the number of breakouts. It is preferable to use acne-fighting products that are not overly drying.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Myth 11:</strong> <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/unraveling-the-mystery-of-blackheads-everything-you-need-to-know">Blackheads</a> are dirt that has gotten stuck in your pores. <span>Debunk: Sebum, or skin oil, oxidises inside the pore to cause blackheads, a type of acne, rather than dirt</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Myth 12: </strong>Your skin will be cleaner the more you scrub<span>.</span> Debunked<span>: Excessive scrubbing can cause skin irritation and damage. Generally, gentle cleansing is sufficient to keep your skin clean.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Understanding the truth behind these skincare myths can help you make more informed skincare decisions and avoid potential skin problems. Always seek personalised advice from a dermatologist or skincare professional based on your specific skin needs.</span></p>

<p><span>Professional skincare treatments provide numerous advantages for your skin, such as specialised solutions to various conditions and improved results when compared to at-home skincare. Here are some of the most important benefits of expert skincare treatments:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Customisation</b><span>: Skincare professionals can tailor treatments to your specific skin type, concerns, and goals.  This tailored approach ensures that your skin receives the attention it requires.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Expertise</b><span>: Skincare professionals, such as dermatologists, estheticians, and skincare therapists, have in-depth knowledge of skin biology, conditions, and the most recent treatment techniques.</span></p>
</li>

<p><b>Higher Concentration Products</b><span>: Professional treatments use higher-concentration products, such as chemical peels and serums, which can provide more potent and effective results than over-the-counter alternatives.</span></p>
</li>

<p><b>Safe and Controlled Environment</b><span>: Professional procedures are carried out in a sterile, controlled setting, which lowers the possibility of complications or infections.</span></p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Firming and Tightening</b><span>: Several procedures, like ultrasound and radiofrequency, can firm and tighten the skin, giving the appearance of younger skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Long-Term Benefits</b><span>: Professional treatments frequently have cumulative effects, which means you can continue to improve the appearance and health of your skin with a series of sessions.</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span>Before beginning any treatment, it is crucial to speak with a skincare specialist to determine the best course of action for your particular concerns and to assess your skin's needs. Keep in mind that some professional treatments may require multiple sessions for optimal results, so planning in advance is key, especially if you're preparing for a special occasion like a wedding.</span></p>
<h3><b>Skin Assessment </b></h3>

<p><span><img alt="Skin Assessment" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/81_b7b3b9d7-8034-4428-bf8c-edee066b93b1_480x480.png?v=1699950080"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>A skin assessment is a thorough examination of the condition, type, and specific problems of your skin. It is usually done by a skincare expert, such as a dermatologist or licenced esthetician. It guarantees that the products and treatments you use are effective and appropriate for your skin type and problems, assisting you in achieving the best results possible. If you're confused about your skin type or have specific skin problems, make an appointment with a dermatologist or licenced esthetician for a professional skin assessment.</span></p>
<h3><b>Hair Assessment</b></h3>

<p><span><img alt="Hair Assessment" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/108_eae8e520-78ed-403f-998e-2d0136d8363d_480x480.png?v=1699958540"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>A hair assessment is a comprehensive analysis, typically carried out by a trichologist, hair stylist, or medical professional, of your hair's type, condition, and specific concerns. A hair evaluation determines hair type, assesses hair condition, analyses scalp health, detects hair and scalp issues, evaluates hair texture, assesses hair porosity, measures hair elasticity, discusses lifestyle and hair care habits, sets hair goals, and recommends products and treatments. It guarantees that the products and treatments you use are suited for your individual hair type and issues, allowing you to achieve the greatest results and keep your hair healthy and attractive. If you are unsure about your hair type or have specific hair and scalp issues, consider scheduling a consultation with a hairstylist or trichologist for a professional hair assessment.</span></p>
<h3><b>DNA Test for Skin and Hair</b></h3>

<p><span><img alt="DNA Test for Skin Hair" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/109_b45f288a-6782-4caf-aa13-cd0ed52ec988_480x480.png?v=1699958568"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>A simple swab test is typically performed at a clinic or using an at-home DNA testing kit. The swab is then sent to a laboratory, where the genetic components are disassembled and researched to learn about your dominant genes, current collagen and antioxidant levels in your skin, and UV and inflammatory protective factors. Once these characteristics are identified, specialists can help you choose the best skincare products for your skin's needs and provide preventative measures. While DNA tests can provide useful information about a person's genetic proclivities, they are mostly used for medical, genealogical, and ancestry purposes. Some DNA tests, such as those offered by clinikally, can provide information about specific genetic traits, but these traits are usually related to medical conditions or ancestry markers rather than specific cosmetic features such as skin and hair type. If you want to understand your skin or hair characteristics for cosmetic purposes, you should see a dermatologist, trichologist, or licenced esthetician or hairstylist. These experts can visually assess your skin and hair and make recommendations based on their knowledge. </span></p>

<p><span><img alt="How to get glowing skin at home: Easy skincare routine" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/110_66eaa5c0-3782-40b6-af8a-d4cfaf9c5c9b_480x480.png?v=1699958670"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>The three essential tips for a skincare regimen include cleansing, moisturising, and protecting.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Cleaning the face twice daily is vital to eliminating any residual dirt, oil, and/or makeup from the face. Harsh cleansers do more harm than good. Therefore, it’s essential to use a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/parabens-in-skincare-and-cosmetics-a-deep-dive-into-the-controversy">paraben</a> and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/sulphates-in-skincare-and-unraveling-the-reality">sulphate</a>-free cleanser.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>We keep ourselves moisturised in winter but forget to moisturise in summer. It is necessary to moisturise regardless of the season. The skin becomes soft and supple as the moisturiser helps lock the moisture in our skin cells. Any skin treatment/makeup works better on nourished skin. Use a chemical-free moisturiser for best results.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Your skincare routine is incomplete without sun protection. Make sure that you apply sunscreen before you step out. Sunscreen will protect your skin from harmful rays.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Our lifestyle plays a vital role in keeping us and our skin healthy. We should revisit our routine every once in a while to ensure that we eat a balanced diet, drink sufficient water, exercise, and get adequate sleep. Stress can cause and/or worsen many skin problems, such as acne, pigmentation, and signs of aging. Therefore, we should try to de-stress by indulging in recreational activities like meditation and yoga. Every woman deserves to look and feel good on her big day. However, this doesn’t happen most often, as stress leads to an increase in the cortisol hormone, which hampers the skin’s ability to hold on to water, taking away its natural glow and making it look dull. Stress can also cause sleeplessness, causing dark circles and puffiness around the eye. Constant frowning and muscle tension can lead to the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on our faces.</span></p>
