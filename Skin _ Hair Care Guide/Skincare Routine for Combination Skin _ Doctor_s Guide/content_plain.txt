Is your skin dry in some places but oily in others? If this is the case, you have combination skin. Balancing these two opposing skin types may appear difficult at first, but with the right information and products, balancing combination skin is actually a lot easier than you might think. A skincare routine for combination skin typically involves using products that can balance the oily and dry areas of the face. Here's a simple skincare routine that you can follow:
Cleanse
: Start with a
gentle cleanser
that removes dirt, oil, and makeup without stripping the skin of its natural oils. Look for a cleanser that is formulated for combination skin.
Tone
: Use a toner that helps balance the
skin's pH
and removes any remaining impurities. Look for a toner that is alcohol-free, as alcohol can dry out the skin.
Serum
: Apply a serum that hydrates and nourishes the skin. Look for a serum that contains ingredients such as
hyaluronic acid
, vitamin C, or niacinamide, which can help brighten the skin and improve texture.
Moisturize
: Use a lightweight
moisturizer
that is oil-free and non-comedogenic. This will help prevent clogged pores and breakouts. Look for a moisturizer that contains ingredients like
glycerin
or ceramides, which help hydrate the skin.
Sunscreen
: Protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays by using a
broad-spectrum sunscreen
with an SPF of 30 or higher. Look for a sunscreen that is oil-free and non-comedogenic.
Exfoliate
: Use a gentle exfoliating scrub or chemical exfoliant once or twice a week to remove dead skin cells and reveal brighter, smoother skin. Look for a product that contains
salicylic acid
, which can help unclog pores and prevent breakouts.
Remember to always patch test new products before incorporating them into your routine, and consult with a dermatologist if you have any concerns about your skin.
What is combination skin
Combination skin is a term used to describe a skin type that has both oily and dry areas. People with combination skin typically have an oily T-zone, which includes the forehead, nose, and chin, while the cheeks and other areas of the face may be dry or normal. This can make finding the right skincare products a bit challenging, as products designed for oily skin may be too drying for the dry areas of the face, while products designed for
dry skin
may be too heavy for the oily areas. It's important to identify your skin type and use products that are specifically formulated for combination skin to help balance the oil production and keep the skin hydrated without causing excess oiliness or dryness.
Signs of combination skin
Combination skin is a common skin type characterized by having both oily and dry areas on the face. The signs of combination skin can include:
Oily T-zone
: The
T-zone
, which includes the forehead, nose, and chin, tends to be oily while the rest of the face is dry.
Enlarged pores
: Combination skin often has larger pores in the T-zone, which can become clogged and result in
blackheads
and
pimples
.
Dry patches
: Other areas of the face, such as the cheeks and jawline, may be dry, flaky, or rough to the touch.
Shine
: The oily areas of combination skin tend to have a shiny or greasy appearance, especially in the T-zone.
Acne
: Combination skin is prone to developing acne in the oily areas, especially if the pores become clogged.
Sensitivity
: Combination skin can also be sensitive, with some areas prone to redness or irritation.
Makeup wear
: Makeup can be difficult to apply on combination skin, as different parts of the face may require different products or formulations to achieve an even, natural look.
What causes combination skin
Combination skin occurs when different parts of your face have different skin types. Typically, the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) is oilier, while the cheeks and other areas are drier. The exact cause of combination skin is not fully understood, but it may be related to genetics, hormones, or
environmental factors
.
One theory is that genetics play a role, as certain individuals may have inherited skin that produces more oil in some areas and less in others. Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause, can also affect the skin's oil production and contribute to combination skin. Additionally, environmental factors like climate, diet, and skincare habits can impact skin health and lead to combination skin.
Effective skincare for combination skin involves using products that balance the skin's oil production while also providing enough hydration to prevent dryness. This may include using gentle cleansers, oil-free moisturizers, and spot treatments for oily areas. It's important to avoid harsh products that can strip the skin of its natural oils and cause further dryness or irritation.
Best combination skin products
Combination skin can be tricky to manage as it typically has both oily and dry areas, so it's important to use products that cater to both concerns. Here are some of the best combination skin products:
Cleanser
: A gentle cleanser that removes excess oil and dirt without stripping the skin of its natural oils is essential. Look for a foaming or gel-based cleanser that contains
salicylic acid
or glycolic acid to exfoliate and unclog pores.
Toner
: A toner that helps balance the skin's pH levels and removes any remaining dirt and oil is important. Look for a toner that contains ingredients like witch hazel, tea tree oil, or rosewater to soothe and hydrate the skin.
Moisturizer
: A lightweight, oil-free moisturizer that hydrates the skin without clogging pores is important. Look for a moisturizer that contains
hyaluronic acid
or ceramides to help lock in moisture and keep the skin plump and hydrated.
Sunscreen
: A
broad-spectrum sunscreen
with at least SPF 30 is important to protect the skin from harmful UV rays. Look for a non-greasy formula that doesn't leave a white cast on the skin.
Serum
: A serum that contains antioxidants like vitamin C or E, niacinamide, or retinol can help improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Face mask
: A face mask that contains ingredients like clay, charcoal, or kaolin can help draw out impurities and excess oil from the skin, leaving it feeling refreshed and balanced.
Remember to always patch test new products and introduce them slowly into your skincare routine.
Consult with a dermatologist
or skincare professional if you have any concerns or questions about your specific skin type and concerns.
AHAs and BHAs
AHAs and BHAs
are two types of exfoliating acids commonly used in skincare products. AHAs, or alpha hydroxy acids, are water-soluble acids derived from fruits and milk. The most common types of AHAs used in skincare products are
glycolic acid
(derived from sugar cane) and lactic acid (derived from milk). AHAs work by breaking down the bonds between dead skin cells, allowing them to be easily removed from the skin's surface. They are particularly effective at reducing the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and uneven skin tone.
BHAs, or beta hydroxy acids, are oil-soluble acids derived from salicylic acid. BHAs penetrate deep into the pores to dissolve the oil and debris that can cause acne and blackheads. They also have anti-inflammatory properties, making them useful for treating redness and inflammation associated with acne-prone skin.
Both AHAs and BHAs can be effective in improving the overall appearance of the skin, but they may be better suited for different skin types and concerns. AHAs are generally better for dry or mature skin types, while BHAs are more effective for oily or acne-prone skin. It's important to use these acids as directed, as overuse can lead to skin irritation and damage.
Water based formulas
Water-based formulas refer to cosmetic, skincare, and hair care products that use water as the primary ingredient or base. This includes products like lotions, creams, serums, shampoos, and conditioners, which use water as the primary carrier for active ingredients and other components.
Water-based formulas are popular in the beauty industry because they are lightweight, hydrating, and easily absorbed by the skin and hair. They also tend to be more affordable than oil-based or silicone-based products.
However, water-based formulas may not be suitable for all skin types, especially those with very dry skin, as they may not provide enough moisture. Additionally, they may not be as long-lasting as oil-based or silicone-based formulas, which can be a drawback for certain products like foundation or eyeshadow.
Overall, water-based formulas are a popular choice for those seeking lightweight, hydrating, and affordable beauty products.
Oil Free, Non Comedogenic Formulas
Oil-free and non-comedogenic formulas are important for people who have oily or acne-prone skin. Non-comedogenic means that a product is designed not to clog pores or contribute to the formation of acne. Here are some examples of oil-free and non-comedogenic formulas:
Cetaphil PRO Oil Control Foam Wash
:
Cetaphil PRO Oil Control Foam Wash
is a deep cleansing formula that is delivered via an instant foaming pump. It removes pore-clogging impurities, makeup, and excess oil gently and without drying out the skin.
Adonis DS Acne Face Wash
: With the
Adonis DS Acne Face Wash
, you can get rid of acne-causing bacteria and excess oil on your skin. It effectively treats and prevents acne by regulating sebum production. The face wash gives the skin a unique glow by giving it a fresh and youthful appearance while also preventing acne from forming.
Cetaphil Gentle Foaming Cleanser
: The
Cetaphil Gentle Foaming Cleanser
All Skin Types removes dirt, oil, and makeup without interfering with the skin's natural moisture balance. This item is suitable for all skin types and has been clinically proven to be hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic.
Cetaphil PRO Oil Control Moisturizing Lotion
:
Cetaphil PRO Oil Control Moisturizing Lotion
is a light, oil-free lotion that moisturises for 24 hours. Its MicroPearl Mattifying Technology aids in shine control. This product has a broad-spectrum SPF of 30 and protects against harmful UVA/UVB rays.
It's important to remember that everyone's skin is different, so what works for one person may not work for another. If you have concerns about your skin or are experiencing acne, it's always a good idea to consult with a dermatologist.
Skin care routine for combination skin
A combination skin type can be a bit tricky to take care of because it has both oily and dry areas. However, with the right products and routine, you can balance out the oil and moisture levels in your skin. Here is a basic skincare routine for combination skin:
Cleanser
: Use a gentle, pH-balanced
cleanser
to wash your face twice a day. Look for a cleanser that doesn't strip your skin of its natural oils, but also doesn't leave a greasy residue. Foaming cleansers work well for oily areas, while cream cleansers are great for dry areas.
Toner
: Use a toner to balance your skin's pH level and remove any remaining dirt or makeup. Look for a toner that is alcohol-free and contains hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid.
Serum
: Apply a lightweight serum that targets your specific skin concerns, such as hydration or brightening. Look for serums with ingredients like
vitamin C
, niacinamide, or hyaluronic acid.
Moisturizer
: Use a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer that hydrates your skin without clogging your pores. Apply it to your entire face, paying extra attention to the dry areas.
Sunscreen
: Protect your skin from harmful UV rays by using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. Apply it every morning as the last step in your skincare routine.
In addition to these steps, it's also important to exfoliate your skin once or twice a week to remove dead skin cells and unclog pores. Use a gentle physical exfoliator or a chemical exfoliator containing alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs). And, always remember to drink plenty of water and maintain a healthy diet for overall skin health.
Use a gentle facial cleanser
Using a gentle facial cleanser is important for maintaining healthy and radiant skin. A gentle facial cleanser is formulated to remove dirt, oil, and impurities from the skin without stripping it of its natural oils and moisture. Here are some reasons why you should use a gentle facial cleanser:
Prevents irritation
: Harsh facial cleansers can strip your skin of its natural oils, leaving it dry and irritated. A gentle facial cleanser will clean your skin without causing irritation.
Preserves moisture
: Your skin needs moisture to stay healthy and glowing. A gentle facial cleanser will remove dirt and impurities from your skin while preserving its natural moisture.
Suitable for all skin types
: A gentle facial cleanser is suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin. It will not cause redness or irritation and will leave your skin feeling soft and supple.
Improves skin texture
: A gentle facial cleanser can help improve the texture of your skin by removing dead skin cells and promoting cell renewal. This can leave your skin looking brighter and more radiant.
Overall, using a gentle facial cleanser is an important step in your skincare routine. It can help keep your skin healthy, radiant, and looking its best.
Add routine exfoliation to your routine
I've detailed my Sunday night routine for full body exfoliation, including how I prepare my skin for self-tanner, below. You may have noticed that I prefer a subtle glow all year, but even if you prefer a paler look, summer is coming and, of course, I'm spilling all the exfoliation products I keep on hand to guide me through this little pampering routine. I can certainly provide some general advice on how to incorporate routine exfoliation into your skincare regimen.
Exfoliation is the process of removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin, which can help to reveal brighter, smoother, and more even-toned skin. Here are some tips for adding routine exfoliation to your skincare routine:
Determine your skin type
: Not all exfoliants are created equal, and some may be too harsh for certain skin types. If you have sensitive skin, you may want to opt for a
gentle exfoliant
like a chemical exfoliant with a low concentration of alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs). If you have oily or acne-prone skin, you may benefit from a stronger exfoliant like a physical exfoliant or a higher concentration chemical exfoliant.
Choose the right exfoliant
: There are two main types of exfoliants: physical exfoliants (like scrubs or brushes) and chemical exfoliants (like AHAs and BHAs). Physical exfoliants work by physically scrubbing away dead skin cells, while chemical exfoliants dissolve the bonds between dead skin cells, allowing them to be easily removed. You may want to experiment with different types of exfoliants to find the one that works best for your skin.
Start slow
: If you're new to exfoliation, it's important to start slowly to avoid irritating your skin. Begin by exfoliating once a week, and gradually increase the frequency as your skin becomes more accustomed to the process.
Follow up with moisturizer
: Exfoliation can be drying to the skin, so it's important to follow up with a moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated and healthy.
Be consistent
: Routine exfoliation is key to achieving and maintaining the benefits of exfoliation, so it's important to make it a regular part of your skincare routine. Consider setting a reminder in your calendar or incorporating it into your morning or evening routine.
Remember to listen to your skin and adjust your exfoliation frequency and type as needed. If you experience any irritation or discomfort, reduce the frequency of exfoliation or switch to a gentler exfoliant. With consistent and gentle exfoliation, you can achieve a brighter, smoother, and more radiant complexion.
Never skip moisturiser
That's great advice! Moisturizer is an essential part of a healthy skincare routine. It helps to keep your skin hydrated and nourished, which is important for maintaining its natural barrier function and protecting it from external stressors such as pollution and UV rays.
Moisturizer helps to replenish the skin's natural moisture balance and prevent dryness, flakiness, and irritation. It can also improve the texture and tone of your skin, giving it a smoother, softer, and more radiant appearance.
When choosing a moisturizer, it's important to consider your skin type and any specific concerns you may have, such as acne or sensitivity. Look for products that are formulated with high-quality ingredients and free from harsh chemicals that can damage your skin.
Remember to apply your moisturizer every day, ideally after cleansing your skin, to reap the full benefits of this essential skincare step.
Avoid touching your face
Avoiding touching your face is an important practice to help prevent the spread of germs and reduce your risk of getting sick. Many people touch their faces without even realizing it, and this can introduce germs from your hands into your eyes, nose, and mouth, which are entry points for viruses and bacteria. To avoid touching your face, try to become more aware of when you are doing it, and make a conscious effort to stop. You can also try the following tips:
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially before eating, after using the bathroom, and after being in public places.
Use hand sanitizer when you can't wash your hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces, such as your phone, computer, and doorknobs.
If you need to touch your face, use a tissue or the back of your hand, rather than your fingers.
By practicing good hygiene and being mindful of your actions, you can help protect yourself and others from illness.
Use broad spectrum sunscreen
Broad spectrum sunscreen is an essential tool for protecting your skin from the harmful effects of the sun. The sun emits both UVA and UVB rays, both of which can damage your skin and lead to skin cancer. A broad-spectrum sunscreen will protect your skin from both types of rays, providing more complete protection.
When selecting a broad-spectrum sunscreen, make sure it has an SPF (Sun Protection Factor) of at least 30. This will provide adequate protection for most people. It's also important to apply sunscreen properly. Apply it generously to all exposed skin, and reapply every two hours, or more frequently if you're swimming or sweating.
Using broad spectrum sunscreen is important not just on sunny days, but also on cloudy or overcast days, as the sun's rays can still penetrate through clouds and cause damage to your skin. It's also important to use sunscreen year-round, not just in the summer.
In addition to using broad spectrum sunscreen, you can also protect your skin by seeking shade during the hottest parts of the day, wearing protective clothing, such as hats and long-sleeved shirts, and avoiding tanning beds. By taking these precautions, you can help protect your skin from the harmful effects of the sun and reduce your risk of skin cancer
Treat your complexion with face mask
Using a
face mask
can be a great way to give your complexion a boost. Face masks come in a variety of types and can be tailored to address different skin concerns, such as dryness, acne, and dullness.
Here are some tips for treating your complexion with a face mask:
Determine your skin type
: Before choosing a face mask, it's important to determine your skin type. If you have oily or acne-prone skin, you may want to choose a mask that contains ingredients like salicylic acid or clay, which can help absorb excess oil and unclog pores. If you have dry or sensitive skin, look for a mask that contains hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid or aloe vera.
Choose the right mask for your skin concern
: If you're looking to target a specific skin concern, like fine lines or
hyperpigmentation
, look for a mask that contains ingredients like vitamin C or
retinol
, which can help brighten and even out the skin tone.
Apply the mask properly
: Before applying a face mask, make sure to cleanse your skin thoroughly to remove any dirt or makeup. Apply the mask evenly to your face and leave it on for the recommended amount of time, typically 10-20 minutes. Rinse off the mask with warm water and pat your face dry.
Use a mask once or twice a week
: It's important not to overdo it with face masks, as using them too frequently can irritate the skin. Aim to use a mask once or twice a week, depending on your skin type and the mask you're using.
Follow up with skincare
: After using a face mask, follow up with your usual skincare routine, including moisturizer and sunscreen if you're going outside. This will help lock in the benefits of the mask and keep your skin looking healthy and radiant.
Tend to your dry under eyes
Dryness
under the eyes
can be caused by various factors such as aging, dehydration, lack of sleep, allergies, and harsh weather conditions. Here are some tips to tend to your dry under eyes:
Moisturize
: Use a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer to hydrate the delicate skin under your eyes. Look for products containing ingredients like hyaluronic acid or ceramides, which can help lock in moisture.
Stay hydrated
:
Drink plenty of water
to keep your body and skin hydrated. Dehydration can contribute to dryness under the eyes.
Get enough sleep
: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night to help your body repair and regenerate. Lack of sleep can cause your skin to appear dry and tired.
Avoid rubbing your eyes
: Rubbing your eyes can irritate the skin and make dryness worse. If you need to relieve itching or irritation, try using a cold compress instead.
Use sunscreen
: Protect your skin from harsh UV rays by applying a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every day. UV damage can cause dryness and premature aging.
Avoid allergens
: If you have allergies, try to avoid triggers that can cause irritation and dryness under the eyes. This may include certain foods, environmental allergens, or cosmetics.
Consult a dermatologist
: If your dryness persists or is accompanied by other symptoms like itching or redness, it's best to
see a dermatologist
for an evaluation. They can recommend the best treatment options for your specific needs.

Cleanse
: Cleansing is the first step in any skincare routine. It helps to remove dirt, oil, and impurities from your skin. Use a gentle cleanser that is appropriate for your skin type, and be sure to cleanse twice a day, morning and night.
Exfoliate
: Exfoliation helps to remove dead skin cells that can clog pores and lead to acne. Use a gentle exfoliant once or twice a week, depending on your skin type. Avoid over-exfoliating, as this can cause irritation and dryness.
Moisturize
: Moisturizing is important for all skin types, even oily skin. Choose a moisturizer that is appropriate for your skin type and use it twice a day, morning and night. This will help to keep your skin hydrated and healthy-looking.
Use sunscreen
: Sunscreen is important to protect your skin from harmful UV rays, which can cause premature aging and skin cancer. Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 and apply it every day, even on cloudy days.
Treat acne
: If you have acne-prone skin, use a treatment product that contains salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. These ingredients help to unclog pores and reduce inflammation.
Address other skin concerns
: If you have other skin concerns, such as fine lines and wrinkles, dark spots, or uneven skin tone, use products that are specifically designed to address these issues. Look for products that contain ingredients like retinol, vitamin C, or alpha hydroxy acids.
Remember that achieving clear, healthy-looking skin takes time and patience. Stick to your skincare routine and be consistent with your products. If you have persistent skin concerns, talk to a dermatologist for personalized advice and treatment options.
