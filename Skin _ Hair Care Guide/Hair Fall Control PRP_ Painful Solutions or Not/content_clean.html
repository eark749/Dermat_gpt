<p><span>PRP therapy is a hair loss treatment that enhances and preserves <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hair-regrow-serum%20">hair growth</a>. However, PRP therapy is pricey and may not be appropriate for everyone. PRP is a medical treatment that can aid healing, regeneration, and growth. It is frequently used to treat injured ligaments, tendons, and muscles.</span></p>
<h3><b>What is PRP Therapy?</b></h3>
<div><img alt="What is PRP Therapy?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/What_is_PRP_Therapy_1_480x480.jpg?v=1725433296"/></div>
<p><span>PRP stands for "platelet-rich plasma." PRP therapy takes the benefits of the best-rich plasma in your blood, it speeds up the healing process, promotes growth factors, and enhances levels of <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/collagen">collagen</a> and stem cells—all of which are naturally created by the body to keep you looking youthful and fresh.</span></p>
<h3><b>How Does PRP Therapy Work for Hair Fall Control?</b></h3>

<p><span>Platelets within platelet-rich plasma (PRP) activate upon injection into the scalp, releasing many growth factors that stimulate hair growth. These growth factors activate fibroblasts, synthesize collagen, facilitate the extracellular matrix, and cause excessive production of natural growth factors.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Procedure: What to Expect</b></h3>
<div><img alt="The Procedure: What to Expect" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/The_Procedure_What_to_Expect_480x480.jpg?v=1725433297"/></div>
<p><span>PRP therapy involves injecting platelet-rich plasma cells into the afflicted scalp area. Plasma is the liquid component of blood, consisting of platelets, white cells, and red blood cells. Platelets aid blood clotting and contain cytokines and proteins that stimulate growth, healing, and rejuvenation.</span></p>
<h3><b>Pre-Treatment Preparations</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Pre-Treatment Preparations" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Pre-Treatment_Preparations_480x480.jpg?v=1725433296"/></div>
<p><span>Ensure you receive plenty of sleep for at least two days before PRP therapy. This involves a minimum of 6-7 hours of sleep each night. Avoid going to the gym for at least 24 hours before and 24 hours after your PRP procedure. Please tell the clinic if you develop any acute diseases within two days of receiving PRP treatment.</span></p>
<h3><b>Step-by-Step Process of PRP Therapy</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Blood collection of 10 to 60 milliliters (mL) from the arm and centrifuge. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>After about 10 minutes, blood will separate into three layers: platelet-free plasma, platelet-rich plasma, and red blood cells.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Platelet-rich plasma is taken into a syringe and injected into areas of the head that need more hair growth, frequency, and duration.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Post-Treatment Care and Recovery</b></h3>

<p><span>It could take 6–8 weeks to determine the body's response to the treatment. Complete healing can take 3-6 months, with tendon injuries typically requiring a more extended recovery period. You will have a follow-up consultation with your provider after six weeks and three months to assess your progress.</span></p>
<h2><b>Pain and Discomfort: The Reality of PRP Therapy</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Pain and Discomfort: The Reality of PRP Therapy" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Pain_and_Discomfort_The_Reality_of_PRP_Therapy_480x480.jpg?v=1725433296"/></div>

<p><span>This therapy causes considerable discomfort but is often well tolerated. Anesthetics may help alleviate pain during PRP therapy. If you have any pain-related questions, you should consult your healthcare professional.</span></p>
<h4><b>Managing Discomfort Post-Treatment</b></h4>
<p><span>For the first 48 hours following a PRP injection, the patient may suffer pain and tightness around the treatment area. Cold compression can help in relieving pain.
