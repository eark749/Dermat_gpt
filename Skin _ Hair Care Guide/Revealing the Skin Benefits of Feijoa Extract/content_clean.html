<p><span>Feijoa extract, obtained from the fruit and leaves of the feijoa plant, provides numerous skin health benefits due to its high concentration of vitamins, antioxidants, and other bioactive substances. Here are the main advantages of feijoa extract for skin health.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Antioxidant Protection</b><span>: Feijoa extract contains several antioxidants, including <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-vitamin-c3-serum">vitamin C</a>, polyphenols, and flavonoids. These antioxidants assist in neutralizing free radicals, which are unstable chemicals that can harm skin cells and hasten aging. Feijoa extract helps to keep the skin looking young and radiant by protecting it from oxidative stress.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Anti-inflammatory Properties</b><span>: Feijoa extract includes anti-inflammatory chemicals, such as flavonoids and triterpenoids. These substances aid in reducing inflammation, redness, and irritation in the skin. This makes feijoa extract useful for treating inflammatory skin diseases like <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-nia-serum">acne</a>, eczema, and rosacea.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydration &amp; Moisturization</b><span>: Feijoa extract's natural sugars, pectin, and vital fatty acids help to keep it hydrated. These components assist in maintaining moisture in the skin, avoiding dryness, and keeping it soft and supple. This is especially useful for people with dry or sensitive skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Collagen Synthesis</b><span>: Collagen synthesis requires vitamin C, which is plentiful in feijoa extract. Collagen is a structural protein that keeps the skin tight and elastic. Feijoa extract promotes collagen formation, which helps decrease the appearance of fine lines and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-skin-renewer-retinol-serum">wrinkles</a>, resulting in firmer, more youthful skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skin Repair and Regeneration</b><span>: Feijoa extract includes bioactive substances such as carotenoids and vitamins, aiding skin repair and regeneration. These substances speed up the healing process of damaged skin, encouraging the regeneration of healthy skin cells and enhancing overall skin texture and tone.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Antimicrobial Properties</b><span>: Feijoa extract contains antimicrobial components such as terpenoids and essential oils. These qualities protect the skin from bacterial and fungal infections, making feijoa extract useful for treating acne and avoiding other skin infections.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Anti-aging Benefits</b><span>: Feijoa extract is an effective anti-aging component due to its antioxidant content, collagen-boosting abilities, and hydration effects. It helps to minimize the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots while keeping skin elasticity and firmness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Soothing and Calming</b><span>: Feijoa extract's anti-inflammatory and moisturizing qualities soothe and calm inflamed skin. This is especially useful for illnesses such as rosacea and eczema when the skin needs extra attention to reduce redness and pain.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Even Skin Tone</b><span>: Regular application of feijoa extract can help improve skin tone and texture. Antioxidants and vitamins aid in minimizing <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">pigmentation </a>and provide a more even, luminous complexion.</span></p>

<h3><b>Storing and Preserving Feijoa Extract<br/></b></h3>
<div><img alt="Storing and Preserving Feijoa Extract" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Banner_5_81_480x480.jpg?v=1720098242"/></div>
<h4><span>Storing and keeping feijoa extract properly is critical for maintaining its potency and preventing deterioration. Here are some suggestions for storing and preserving feijoa extract.</span></h4>
<h4>
<b>Storing Feijoa Extract</b><span>:</span>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>If you've just extracted juice or pulp from feijoa, keep it in an airtight container in the fridge. This preserves its freshness and inhibits bacterial growth. If you have a commercially made feijoa extract or serum, follow the manufacturer's directions. In general, these products should be kept cool and dry, away from direct sunlight.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Feijoa extract should be stored at temperatures ranging from 5°C to 15°C (41°F to 59°F). Avoid exposing it to severe temperatures, since this can impair its stability and efficacy.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Use clean, airtight glass containers or bottles to store feijoa extract. This prevents oxidation and contamination, ensuring the extract remains fresh for longer.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Store feijoa extract away from direct sunlight and in a dark environment. Light exposure can degrade the active compounds in the extract over time.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Preserving Feijoa Extract:</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>If preparing homemade feijoa extract, consider adding natural preservatives like vitamin E oil or grapefruit seed extract (GSE). These help extend the shelf life of the extract by inhibiting microbial growth and oxidation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Adjusting the pH of the feijoa extract can also help in preserving it. Most microorganisms thrive in neutral pH conditions, so adjusting the pH to slightly acidic (around pH 4-5) can help prevent spoilage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Feijoa extract itself contains antioxidants that can help preserve its freshness. However, adding additional antioxidants like vitamin C or rosemary extract can further extend its shelf life by scavenging free radicals that cause oxidation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Check the expiration date if using commercially prepared feijoa extract. For homemade extracts, use them within a few weeks if refrigerated, or freeze them for longer-term storage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Use clean utensils and containers when handling feijoa extract to prevent contamination. Ensure that hands are washed thoroughly before extraction or handling.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h5><span>Feijoa extract can greatly improve skin hydration and smoothness due to its high concentration of therapeutic components. Here's how feijoa extract helps improve moisture and smoothness:</span></h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Natural Moisturizing Factors</b><span>: Feijoa extract contains natural sugars and pectin, which are humectants that attract moisture to the skin and help maintain hydration levels. This helps to plump up the skin and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Rich in Antioxidants</b><span>: Vitamin C in feijoa extract is a powerful antioxidant that protects the skin from oxidative stress caused by free radicals. This protection promotes skin integrity and prevents moisture loss. These antioxidants also help to keep skin hydrated by fighting free radicals and strengthening the skin's barrier function.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Barrier Function Support</b><span>: Feijoa extract includes omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are required to maintain the skin barrier. A good barrier reduces water loss and protects against environmental toxins. The lipids in feijoa extract aid to retain moisture and create a smooth, velvety texture on the skin's surface.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydrating Effects</b><span>: Feijoa itself has a high water content, which directly contributes to hydrating the skin when used in skincare products or DIY treatments. Feijoa extract’s humectant properties draw moisture from the environment into the skin, enhancing overall hydration.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p><span>Use a feijoa extract serum daily to target hyperpigmentation and promote a brighter complexion.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Apply feijoa extract directly to dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation using a cotton swab or pad.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Weekly application of feijoa extract masks can provide a concentrated treatment to lighten dark spots and even out skin tone.</span></p>
