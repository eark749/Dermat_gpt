Unlike other hair loss treatments, hair tattoos do not stimulate regrowth or halt balding. Instead, they make your hair appear less thin by producing small, hair-like tattoos on specific areas of your scalp. When done correctly, the effect can seem just like hair. We explain how hair tattoo procedures operate and what outcomes to expect from this method of treating hair loss. We also cover various possibilities for managing
hair loss
, such as drugs and surgical procedures that permanently restore lost hair.
Understanding the Hair Tattoo Procedure
Fine dots of specific
pigment
are carefully placed into the scalp's dermal layer, giving the appearance of a complete head of hair. This is SMP, or scalp micropigmentation, a non-invasive treatment for people experiencing various stages of hair loss.
What is a Hair Tattoo?
Hair tattoos, also known as scalp tattoos, are exactly what they sound like tattoos used to conceal hair loss and provide the appearance of a full head of hair through a method known as scalp micropigmentation (SMP). This technique includes tattooing thousands of tiny, layered dots on the scalp to resemble natural hair follicles and microscopic hairs. When done by a qualified expert, it can provide the illusion of a full head of hair in a short, buzz-cut haircut. A hair tattoo can make thinning hair appear thicker and more dense.
Micropigmentation hair tattoos can be used to conceal several types of hair loss, such as male pattern
baldness
and
alopecia areata
. If you can tolerate the pain and discomfort, cosmetic hair tattooing might be well worth the effort. As long as you have it done by a professional and strictly adhere to the aftercare instructions, it is a relatively low-risk treatment.
How is a Hair Tattoo Done?
Cosmetic hair tattooing differs significantly from traditional tattooing. Scalp micropigmentation makes use of extremely thin needles to insert little dots of pigment into the skin. These needles cycle at a rate of 100 to 150 times per second, and as each needle makes contact with the upper dermis, it applies a micro-droplet of pigment, resulting in a natural, follicle-like pattern on the scalp. To create the impression of actual, natural hair cut close to the scalp, a trained operator will microneedle pigments as close to the skin's surface as feasible. They'll also utilize a variety of dot sizes and pigments. Because the ink is put close to the skin's surface layer, an SMP treatment gives the appearance of fine, tiny dots rather than the smoother texture of a traditional tattoo. This can hide thinning hair or a receding hairline.
Sometimes SMP is used solely to make hair in a certain area of the scalp appear denser. A hairline tattoo, for example, might be used to conceal scarring following hair transplant surgery or to cover up a receding hairline. The time of the SMP treatment process varies based on the level of hair loss and the number of dots required. Often, tens of thousands of small dots must be applied to the scalp over multiple sessions.
Who is a Good Candidate for a Hair Tattoo?
Hair tattoos can give the appearance of thicker hair for men with:
Androgenetic alopecia
, or male pattern baldness
Thinning hair
Chemotherapy-related hair loss, in the rare event that hair does not regrow naturally after chemotherapy.
Scars and birthmarks on the scalp
Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss.
Costs of Hair Tattoo Treatment
The cost of cosmetic hair tattooing is, in our opinion, one of the most significant drawbacks. According to some sources, extensive tattooing costs between $2,000 and $5,000. The cost of a micropigmentation hair tattoo will vary depending on several factors. This includes the tattoo artist you select, their level of experience, and where you live. And then there's the question of how much tattooing is involved — obviously, patching up a small bald place will require far less labor than becoming completely bald.
Factors Affecting Hair Tattoo Costs
The treatment cost varies depending on a variety of factors. The treatment area, skin type, hair density, scar area, and personal health all have an impact on the scalp micropigmentation process. Each alteration may result in a cost increase or decrease. Let us talk about these aspects and how they affect the procedure's price.
Skin condition
:
It is an important aspect that affects the therapy process. Each skin type requires specific care and changes. Flaky, dry, or
aging
skin; severe
acne
; moles; damaged skin; or sensitive skin necessitate more time and resources. Dealing with these challenges during the procedure makes implanting new pigments significantly more challenging.
Area of Treatment
:
Without a doubt, the area of treatment influences pricing, just as it does the entire treatment process. The cost of micropigmentation varies depending on the location and severity of hair loss. The extent of hair loss reduces skin fertility and makes it tough to implant later on. The treatment will be less expensive in the early stages of balding than if the hair loss continues. The scope of treatment expands with each stage, necessitating greater efforts and resources to combat the issue. In addition, the following treatment's precision and timing vary depending on the skin type.
Hair Style and Density
:
The natural thickness and density of hair also influence the implantation process. The micropigmentation procedure utilizes the body's inherent systems to implant and grow new hair in the dried-out area. Thus, to restore the original hair state, it is critical to examine the pre-hair conditions. The implants must be placed in the proper density sequence to match a person's natural hair state.
Scars
:
Doctors employ scalp micropigmentation to cure head scars. Scars are areas of dead tissue that differ from the living cells on the skin. The pigmentation procedure usually involves sowing pigment into the skin and allowing the body to perform its work. But not in the scarred area.
Average Costs of Hair Tattoos
Scalp micropigmentation costs between Rs. 15,000 and Rs. 80,000, making it more inexpensive than in Western countries. However, the cost varies based on the facility, the number of sessions needed for treatment, and the experience of the hair transplant doctors.
Comparing Hair Tattoo Costs with Other Treatments
Medication reigns supreme when it comes to hair health. Currently, the FDA has approved two medications for hair loss treatment:
Finasteride
: Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that can shrink hair follicles and cause male pattern baldness, is lessened by the prescription drug finasteride.
Minoxidil
: This over-the-counter hair loss medication stimulates blood flow to the follicles. This then propels them into the anagen, or growth, stage of the
hair growth
cycle. This hair loss medication is available in two forms: minoxidil foam and minoxidil solution.
Another treatment option for hair loss is a combination of finasteride and
minoxidil
. While a hair tattoo can conceal baldness and hair thinning, these medications can help slow hair loss. It is even possible that they will stimulate regrowth in areas of your scalp with visible hair loss.
Risks and Side Effects of Hair Tattoos
The greatest risks of scalp micropigmentation stem from using an unlicensed or inexperienced practitioner who may not take the necessary precautions. Possible risks include:
Sensitivity to the pigments used in cosmetics.
Infection caused by needles that were not sterile.
Unwanted or unnatural appearance following therapy.
To avoid these risks:
Select a technician for scalp micropigmentation who is licensed.
Request before and after scalp micropigmentation photos of their work.
If you have allergies, discuss them with your technician before the procedure.
Potential Side Effects
Micro scalp pigmentation is known to cause redness, itching, chapping,
dry scalp
, hair loss, bald spots, and hair thinning, as well as
dermatitis
, hair loss, and itchy burns. Another possible side effect of micro scalp pigmentation is flu-like symptoms, such as fever.
Minimizing Risks and Ensuring Safety
A hair tattoo is a generally low-maintenance treatment, while proper aftercare is required. There is no need to take a tablet or use a topical treatment every day.
Choosing a Reputable Practitioner
To acquire the finest outcomes, research into the many components of scalp micropigmentation is required. These useful hints may impact the specialist you choose, determining whether you get messy, amateurish results or the clean, professional results you desire.
Always verify that they are licensed and experienced professionals.
Take a look at their portfolio and clients.
They have a team of certified experts on-site.
The specialists are patient and passionate.
They have an excellent reputation to back up their services.
