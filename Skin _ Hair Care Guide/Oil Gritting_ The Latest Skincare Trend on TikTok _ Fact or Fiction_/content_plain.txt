"Oil gritting" is a skincare craze that has gained traction on TikTok and other social media platforms. The idea is to use a specialised technique to remove "grits" or hardened sebum plugs from pores by kneading oil into the skin and gently extracting them. While some people claim to have had success with oil gritting, it's important to proceed with caution and examine the following points.
Exploring Oil Gritting: Unraveling the TikTok Trend
Oil gritting is a skincare craze that has gained popularity on social media sites such as TikTok, where individuals share their tips and tricks for removing "grits" from their pores. The term "grits" refers to hardened sebum plugs or debris that can build in the pores and cause blackheads and whiteheads. The oil gritting procedure normally consists of multiple steps:
Begin by massaging a lightweight oil or oil-based
cleanser
into dry skin. The oil helps to dissolve makeup, sunscreen, and excess sebum from the skin's surface.
Massage the oil into the skin with gentle, circular motions for several minutes. Some people prefer to concentrate on the areas with visible blackheads or congested pores.
To open up pores and soften the skin, apply a warm, damp washcloth to the face or use steam. This can improve the effectiveness of the oil cleansing process and make impurities easier to remove.
After massaging the oil into the skin, apply gentle pressure to remove any visible grits or debris from the pores. Some people use their fingertips, while others employ tools such as pore strips or comedone extractors.
Use a water-based cleanser to remove any remaining oil residue and thoroughly clean the skin.
What is Oil Gritting? Decoding the Process
Oil gritting is a skincare procedure that uses oil to remove "grits" or hardened plugs from the pores, usually on the face. The procedure is frequently defined as a means of deep washing the skin and removing impurities that contribute to problems like blackheads and whiteheads. Here's a synopsis of the oil gritting procedure, including oil cleansing, massage, steam or warmth, extraction, and follow-up cleansing.
The Reality of Oil Gritting: Expectations vs. Results
The reality of oil gritting may not match the expectations of social media users and skincare enthusiasts. While some people claim that oil gritting produces visible results, it is important to approach this technique with realistic expectations and consider the following factors:
There is limited scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of oil gritting as a skincare technique. While oil gritting may result in temporary improvements in the appearance of pores or skin texture, the long-term benefits and efficacy of this method are unclear.
Skincare is highly individualised; what works for one person may not work for another. Skin type, genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors all have an impact on oil gritting results.  Some individuals may see noticeable "grits" being extracted from their pores, while others may not experience the same outcome.
Vigorous massaging or aggressive extraction can irritate the skin, causing redness, inflammation, and skin barrier damage. Individuals with sensitive skin or inflammatory skin conditions may be more vulnerable to negative reactions from oil gritting.
Any visible results from oil gritting may be temporary and do not indicate long-term improvements in skin health.  While extracting debris from pores may provide a temporary sense of satisfaction, long-term results require consistent skincare practices and overall skin health.
Overuse of oil cleansing products or excessive manipulation of the skin can disrupt the skin barrier, resulting in dryness, sensitivity, or an imbalance in oil production. It is critical to strike a balance between thoroughly cleansing the skin and preserving its natural protective barrier.
Before attempting oil gritting or any new skincare technique,
consult with a dermatologist
or skincare professional, particularly if you have specific skin concerns or conditions.  A skincare professional can make personalised recommendations and assist you in determining the best treatment plan for your skin.
Best Practices for Safe Oil Gritting
If you are thinking about trying oil gritting, make sure to do so safely to avoid irritation or skin damage. Here are some best practice for safe oil gritting:
Choose the Right Oil
: Use a lightweight, non-comedogenic oil that is appropriate for your skin type.  Mineral oil, jojoba oil, grapeseed oil, and sunflower oil are all common options. Avoid using heavy oils that are known to clog pores, such as coconut or olive oil, if you have oily or acne-prone skin.
Patch Test
: Before applying the oil to your entire face, test a small area of your skin for adverse reactions or sensitivity.  Apply a small amount of oil to the inside of your wrist or elbow, then wait 24 hours to see if any redness, itching, or irritation develop.
Start with Clean Skin
: Wash your face thoroughly to remove any makeup,
sunscreen
, or impurities that may be clogging your pores.  Oil gritting works best with dry skin, so make sure your face is completely dry before applying the oil.
Massage Gently
: Apply the oil to your skin using light, circular strokes, paying particular attention to any areas where blackheads or congestion are apparent.  Excessive pressure or vigorous scrubbing can cause skin irritation and inflammation.
Use Steam or Warmth (Optional)
: Using a warm, damp washcloth or steam on your face can help open up the pores and soften the skin, making impurities easier to remove.  However, this is an optional step that may not be required for everyone.
Be Patient
: Before trying to remove the oil, let it sit on your skin for a few minutes to soften any debris inside the pores.  Rushing the process or attempting to extract grits too quickly may cause skin damage or irritation.
Avoid Over-extraction
: Exercise caution when attempting to extract grits from your pores.  Use gentle pressure and avoid forcing or squeezing the skin too forcefully, as this can lead to inflammation, broken capillaries, or scarring.
Follow up with a Water-based Cleanser
: After oil gritting, use a water-based cleanser to remove any leftover oil residue and thoroughly cleanse the skin. This helps keep the pores clear and prevents breakouts or further congestion.
Moisturize and Protect
: To hydrate and protect your skin after oil gritting, use a lightweight
moisturiser
and sunscreen. Moisturising replenishes lost moisture and soothes the skin, whereas sunscreen prevents UV damage and post-inflammatory
hyperpigmentation
.
Listen to Your Skin
: Pay attention to how your skin reacts to oil gritting and alter your approach accordingly. If you feel redness, irritation, or discomfort, stop using the product and see a dermatologist or skincare specialist.
Following these best practices allows you to safely incorporate oil gritting into your skincare routine, potentially improving the appearance of your pores and skin texture. However, to avoid any negative reactions or damage, approach this technique with caution and pay attention to your skin's needs.
Deep Pore Cleansing: Beyond the Hype of Oil Gritting
Deep pore cleansing is an important aspect of skincare that extends beyond the hype surrounding specific techniques such as oil gritting. While oil gritting is one method for deep pore cleansing, there are several other effective ways to thoroughly clean and unclog pores:
Double Cleaning
: To completely remove makeup, sunscreen, and impurities from the skin, double cleansing entails using an oil-based cleanser first, then a water-based cleanser.  The water-based cleanser gets rid of any leftover residue, and the oil-based cleanser aids in dissolving oil-based debris.
Exfoliation
: Frequent exfoliation encourages cell turnover, clears clogged pores, and gets rid of dead skin cells.  Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) are two types of chemical exfoliants that are especially good at entering pores and removing debris. Exfoliants that are physical, like scrubs or brushes, can also aid in removing surface accumulation.
Clay Masks
: The ability of clay masks, like kaolin or bentonite clay, to draw impurities and excess oil from the skin is well-known.  To minimise the appearance of impurities in your pores, try applying a clay mask once or twice a week.
Steam
: Steam can soften skin and open pores, which facilitates the removal of debris and unclogging of pores.  Before cleansing, you can steam your face with a facial steamer, place your face over a bowl of hot water, or take a warm shower.
Professional Procedures
: If carried out by a certified esthetician or dermatologist, professional procedures such as facials, chemical peels, microdermabrasion, or extractions can offer more thorough pore cleaning and target particular skin issues.  These procedures can yield more noticeable and faster results because they are customised to your skin's needs.
Regular Skincare Routine
: Keeping clean pores and preventing future congestion can be achieved by establishing a regular skincare routine that includes cleansing, exfoliating, moisturising, and protecting the skin.  Choose products formulated for your skin type and concerns, and use them regularly for the best results.
Healthy Lifestyle Habits
: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, such as staying hydrated, eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and managing stress, can all help to keep pores clear and skin healthy.
Choosing the Right Oils: Non-Comedogenic Options for Every Skin Type
Choosing the right oils for your skincare routine is critical, especially if you plan on oil gritting or other oil-based washing procedures. Using non-comedogenic oils can help prevent clogged pores and breakouts, regardless of skin type. Here are some non-comedogenic options suitable for various skin types:
Jojoba Oil
: Jojoba oil is a great option for all skin types, including oily and acne-prone skin, because it closely mimics the skin's natural sebum.  It facilitates the reduction of excess sebum without clogging pores, moisturises the skin, and balances oil production.
Safflower Oil
: Suitable for oily and combination skin types, safflower oil is lightweight and readily absorbed.  It has a high content of linoleic acid, which helps to preserve the skin's natural barrier function and control oil production.
Grapeseed Oil
: Packed with antioxidants like vitamin E, grapeseed oil is lightweight, non-greasy, and suitable for all skin types—even sensitive and acne-prone skin.  It aids in calming inflammation, hydrating the skin, and shielding it from free radical damage.
Sunflower Oil
: Sunflower oil is great for oily and acne-prone skin because it has anti-inflammatory qualities and a high linoleic acid content.  It lessens inflammation, helps to moisturise skin without clogging pores, and encourages a clear complexion.
Argan Oil
: Rich in fatty acids, vitamins, and antioxidants, argan oil is good for all skin types, even dry and mature skin.  It lessens the visibility of fine lines and
wrinkles
, increases skin elasticity, and hydrates the skin.
Hemp Seed Oil
: Rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, hemp seed oil is lightweight, non-greasy, and suitable for all skin types—even sensitive and oily skin.  It relieves irritation, controls oil production, and hydrates the skin.
Sweet Almond Oil
: Sweet almond oil is ideal for all skin types, even dry and sensitive skin, because it is light, gentle, and full of vitamins and minerals.  It enhances skin tone and texture, lessens inflammation, and moisturises the skin.
Rosehip Oil
: Rosehip oil is a lightweight, non-greasy oil that works well on all skin types, even sensitive and mature skin. It is also rich in
vitamin C
and essential fatty acids.  It improves skin hydration, lightens hyperpigmentation, and minimises the look of fine lines and scars.
When selecting an oil for your skincare routine, you should consider your skin type, preferences, and any specific concerns you may have. Patch testing new oils on a small area of your skin can help you determine whether they are right for you before applying them to your entire face. To maintain their potency and freshness, oils should be stored in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight.
The Science of Oil Cleansing: Understanding Its Impact on Skin
Oil cleansing is a skincare technique based on chemistry and biology. Understanding how oil cleansing works and how it affects the skin can help to clear up misconceptions about its effectiveness. Here's an overview of the science behind oil cleansing:
The basic principle of oil washing is that "like dissolves like." Oil-based cleansers contain oils with a chemical structure similar to the sebum produced by the skin. When used on the skin, these oils bind to and dissolve excess sebum, cosmetics, sunscreen, and other oil-based pollutants, efficiently eliminating them from the skin's surface.
Oil-based cleansers frequently contain emulsifiers, which are molecules that aid in the combination of oil and water. When the oil cleanser is combined with water during rinsing, the emulsifiers form a milky emulsion that allows the oil and water to mingle, making it easier to rinse away the oil-based pollutants alongside the cleanser.
Contrary to popular misconception, oil cleaning does not remove the skin's natural oils. Instead, it supports the skin's natural lipid barrier by restoring moisture and reducing moisture loss. Some oils, such as jojoba oil, closely mirror the skin's natural sebum, making them very effective at moisturising without blocking pores.
Oil cleansing can help regulate oil production in the skin. When the skin is stripped of its natural oils by harsh cleansers, it may overcompensate by producing more oil, leading to oily or congested skin. Oil cleansing helps maintain a healthy balance of oils in the skin, which can prevent excess oiliness and breakouts.
Many plant-based oils used in oil cleansing are rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, such as vitamins E and C, polyphenols, and fatty acids. These compounds help protect the skin from oxidative damage, soothe inflammation, and promote overall skin health.
Oil cleansing can help deep clean pores by dissolving and removing hardened sebum plugs, makeup residue, and other debris that can accumulate within the pores. This can help prevent blackheads, whiteheads, and congestion, resulting in clearer, smoother skin.
Some oils used in oil cleansing, such as castor oil, have mild exfoliating properties. These oils help slough off dead skin cells and promote cell turnover, resulting in brighter, more radiant skin.
Oil Gritting vs. Traditional Cleansing Methods: A Comparative   Analysis
Oil gritting and traditional cleansing methods provide distinct approaches to getting clean, clear skin. Here's a comparison between the two techniques:
Oil Gritting
:
Concept
: In oil gritting, hardened sebum plugs are dissolved and extracted from the pores using oil. This is usually done by massaging and extracting the oil.
Mechanism
: By massaging the oil into the skin, the debris inside the pores is softened and dislodged, making extraction simpler.  Some people report seeing visible grits being released from the pores while it is happening.
Benefits
:
Thorough pore cleaning
Possible excision of whiteheads and blackheads
helps produce a smoother, more radiant complexion.
2. Traditional Cleansing Methods
:
Concept
: Using water-based cleansers, traditional cleansing methods emulsify and rinse away dirt, oil, and impurities from the skin's surface.
Mechanism
: To remove dirt and debris from the skin, water-based cleansers use surfactants, which bind to both water and oil.  The cleanser is then rinsed with water.
Benefits
:
Effective removal of surface impurities, makeup, and sunscreen
Gentle cleansing without stripping the skin's natural oils
Suitable for daily use and all skin types

Navigating Skincare Trends: Adopting What Works for You
Navigating skincare trends can be difficult, but finding what works for you is critical to developing a personalised routine that addresses your skin's specific needs. Here are some tips for successfully navigating skincare trends:
Stay informed about skincare trends by researching reputable sources such as dermatologists, skincare experts, and scientific studies. Look for evidence-based information that explains the science behind each trend, as well as the potential benefits and drawbacks.
Before experimenting with new trends, make sure you understand your skin type, concerns, and sensitivity. What works for one person may not work for another, so choose products and techniques that are specific to your needs.
Before incorporating a new product or technique into your routine, conduct a patch test on a small area of your skin to detect any adverse reactions or sensitivities. This can help to reduce irritation and allergic reactions.
Introduce new products or techniques gradually to give your skin time to adjust and see how it responds. Avoid making too many changes to your routine at once because it can be difficult to determine what is causing any negative reactions.
Pay attention to how your skin responds to various products and techniques. If you notice any irritation, sensitivity, or breakouts, stop using the product and reconsider whether it is appropriate for your skin.
Consistency is essential for getting results from any skincare routine. Maintain a consistent routine and let products or techniques work before expecting dramatic results.
If you are unsure about a skincare trend or have specific concerns about your skin, consult a dermatologist or skincare professional. They can provide personalised recommendations based on your skin type and concerns.
In the end, follow your gut and take care of your skin by doing what feels right. Select the skincare trends that speak to you and support your objectives rather than feeling obligated to adopt every new fad that appears.
By educating yourself, understanding your skin, and emphasising consistency and individuality, you can effectively navigate skincare trends and create a routine that works best for you. Remember that skincare is not one-size-fits-all, so it is fine to experiment and discover what works best for your skin.

niacinamide
or
hyaluronic acid
, think about how it complements your current products and where it fits into your routine.
Be Consistent
: Consistency is essential for seeing results from any skincare routine, so stick to it and give it time.  Most skincare trends require consistent use over several weeks or months to see noticeable results, so be patient and persistent.
Monitor Progress
: Keep track of how your skin reacts to the new trend over time and adjust your routine accordingly.  If you are not getting the desired results or are experiencing side effects, reconsider your approach or consult a dermatologist or skincare professional.
Stay Open-Minded
: Be willing to try new trends and products, as well as adapt and evolve your routine based on what works best for your skin.  What works for someone else may not work for you, so follow your instincts and put your skin's needs first.
By following these steps, you can successfully incorporate new skincare trends into your routine and achieve the best results for your skin. Remember to prioritise research, listen to your skin, and stick to your routine to reap the most benefits from any new trend you try.
