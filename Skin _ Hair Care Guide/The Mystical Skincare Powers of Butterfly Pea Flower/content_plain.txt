The butterfly pea flower, formally known as Clitoria ternatea, is not only visually appealing with its bright blue hue, but it also contains several skincare advantages that have been used for generations in traditional medicine practices throughout Asia. This blog provides a glimpse into its mysterious skincare properties.
The Heritage of Butterfly Pea Flower in Beauty
Butterfly pea blossom has a rich history in beauty, reflecting a harmonious blend of tradition, culture, and current innovation, making it a prized ingredient in the pursuit of bright skin.
From Ancient Rituals to Modern Skincare Routines
The development of butterfly pea flowers from ancient rituals to modern beauty routines is remarkable, demonstrating its continuing appeal and efficacy. Whether rooted in tradition or welcomed as a cutting-edge ingredient, its presence in skincare exemplifies a seamless blend of heritage, science, and modern beauty standards.
Understanding the Science Behind the Bloom
The butterfly pea flower's striking blue color is not simply for display; it is the consequence of interesting chemistry at work. Here's an overview of the science underlying the bloom:
Anthocyanins are the key components that give the butterfly pea bloom its bright blue color. These water-soluble pigments, known as flavonoids, can be found in a variety of fruits, vegetables, and flowers. Anthocyanins are pH-sensitive, which means they change color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of their surroundings.
Anthocyanins have a complicated chemical structure with alternating single and double carbon-carbon bonds. This structure enables them to absorb light in the visible spectrum at distinct wavelengths corresponding to different colors. The anthocyanins in butterfly pea blooms absorb largely in the blue-violet range, giving them their distinctive blue color.
The color of butterfly pea flower extracts varies according to the pH of the solution. Anthocyanins look reddish-purple in acidic conditions, but bright blue in alkaline settings. This pH-dependent color change is caused by the reversible conversion of anthocyanins into distinct chemical forms known as flavylium cations (acidic pH) and quinoidal bases (alkaline pH).
Temperature, light exposure, and the presence of metal ions can all affect the stability of anthocyanin pigments. Proper processing and storage processes are required to maintain the color intensity and quality of butterfly pea flower extracts in cosmetics compositions.
Beyond their visual attractiveness, anthocyanins have antioxidant qualities that serve to protect the flower from oxidative stress. In skincare,
antioxidants
can help neutralize free radicals and minimize oxidative damage to the skin, thereby improving its general health and vitality.
