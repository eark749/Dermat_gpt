As a UV filter, benzophenone-4 is a substance that is frequently found in hair care products. It is made to shield hair from the damaging effects of UV rays, which can result in breakage, dryness, and damage. A powerful UV filter, benzophenone-4 can shield hair from the damaging effects of UV rays. Skin irritation, environmental issues, potential health hazards, and a lack of UV protection are some of its potential downsides. When determining whether or not to use benzophenone-4 in hair care products, it's crucial to balance the pros and cons.
What is Benzophenone-4 and How Does it Protect Hair from UV Damage?
Benzophenone-4 is a UV filter that is commonly found in hair care products. It is designed to protect hair from the harmful effects of UV rays, which can cause breakage, dryness, and damage. When UV rays are absorbed by benzophenone-4, they are converted to heat energy and then released safely.  UV radiation is known to damage hair fibres by destroying the proteins and lipids that make up the structure of the hair. This harm may result in dryness, brittleness, split ends, and colour loss. By forming a protective shield around the hair fibres, benzophenone-4 protects the hair from the damaging effects of UV rays.
A powerful UV filter that can offer long-lasting defence against UVA and UVB rays is benzophenone-4. While UVB radiation is mostly to blame for short-term damage like sunburn, UVA radiation is the main cause of long-term hair damage. Benzophenone-4 assists in preventing both short-term and long-term damage to the hair by offering protection against both types of radiation. It functions by absorbing UV rays and transforming them into heat energy, which is then harmlessly released. Benzophenone-4 aids in shielding the hair fibres from UV ray damage by producing a barrier that shields them from entry.
Benzophenone-4 as a Hair Sunscreen for UV Protection
In order to protect consumers from the negative effects of UV radiation, benzophenone-4 is frequently used in hair care products as a UV filter. The sun's UV rays can harm the hair, resulting in dryness, breakage, and colour loss. When benzophenone-4 absorbs UV radiation, it converts it to heat energy, which is then harmlessly released. This stops UV rays from damaging the hair fibres by keeping them from penetrating. The UVA and UVB rays that cause long-term and short-term hair damage, respectively, are both blocked by the highly effective UV filter benzophenone-4.
Benzophenone-4-containing hair care products can help shield the hair from UV ray damage, especially when exposed to the sun for an extended period of time. While these products can be used year-round, the summer, when UV radiation levels are at their highest, is when they are most crucial. It is crucial to remember that other ingredients in hair care products offer UV protection in addition to benzophenone-4. The UV filters octyl methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, avobenzone, and titanium dioxide are also frequently included in hair care products. Combining several UV filters can provide even more UV protection.
Benzophenone-4 and Its Impact on Hair Colour Fading and Texture
While benzophenone-4 effectively shields hair from UV rays, it can eventually have a deleterious effect on hair colour and texture. Benzophenone-4, especially in hair that has been coloured, can cause hair colour to fade. This is because the UV filter may damage the molecules that give the hair its colour, hastening the fading of the colour. Some hair care products may include additional colour-preserving chemicals like antioxidants or colour protectants to counteract this effect.
Benzophenone-4 can change the texture of hair and affect its colour. Even when employing a UV filter like benzophenone-4, prolonged exposure to UV rays can make hair dry and brittle. This may result in breakage, split ends, a rough or frizzy texture, and more. Use hair care products with additional helpful components to reduce the potentially harmful effects of benzophenone-4 on hair texture and colour. This could include hydrating components that keep the hair hydrated and prevent dryness, including humectants or natural oils. Additionally, regularly utilising a deep conditioner or hair mask can keep the hair strong and healthy.
The Potential Risks of Benzophenone-4 in Hair Products
One issue is that, like many other UV filters, benzophenone-4 can build up in the environment and possibly harm aquatic life. Benzophenone-4 can infiltrate rivers and remain in the environment when goods containing it are flushed down the drain. Some producers are creating benzophenone-4 substitutes that are less harmful to the environment in an effort to reduce this risk. Benzophenone-4 may pose certain health hazards, which is another worry. However, some researchers have suggested that benzophenone-4 may have estrogenic activity, which would mean that it might mimic the actions of oestrogen in the body, even if there is no concrete evidence that it is damaging to human health.
This has caused some people to worry that long-term exposure to benzophenone-4 may have harmful consequences for their health, especially if they often use hair care products that contain the chemical. However, it is important to note that regulatory bodies like the FDA and the European Union generally consider the amounts of benzophenone-4 typically present in hair care products to be safe for use. However, some customers could choose to stay away from hair care products that include benzophenone-4 in favour of those that use different UV filters.
Benzophenone-4 and Its Effects on Hair Moisture and Elasticity
UV light exposure can cause the hair to become dry and lose moisture. In order to stop UV rays from damaging the hair shaft and penetrating it, benzophenone-4 works by absorbing them. While benzophenone-4 can aid in preventing hair dehydration, it can also cause a decrease in hair moisture over time. According to studies, exposure to benzophenone-4 over an extended period of time can make hair dry and brittle, decreasing its suppleness. As a result, the hair may become more prone to breakage and split ends, as well as develop a harsh or frizzy texture.
Utilising hair care products with moisturising components is crucial to fending off any potential harm that benzophenone-4 may do to hair moisture and elasticity. This could contain humectants like glycerin or panthenol or natural oils like argan oil or coconut oil. Additionally, regularly applying a deep conditioning treatment or hair mask can keep the hair moisturised and robust. While benzophenone-4 effectively shields hair from UV rays, over time, it may also cause a decline in the hydration and suppleness of the hair. Use hair care products with moisturising elements and take precautions to keep the hair moisturised and healthy to reduce any potential harm benzophenone-4 may cause to the hair.
Benzophenone-4 and Its Link to Hair Breakage and Weakening
According to some data, regular use of hair care products containing benzophenone-4 may cause hair to break and weaken. This is due to the fact that over time, benzophenone-4 can make hair dry and brittle, increasing its susceptibility to breakage and split ends. According to one study in the Journal of Cosmetic Science, hair treated with benzophenone-4 and subjected to UV light broke more frequently than hair not treated with benzophenone-4. The UV filter may have damaged the hair fibres, making them more brittle, according to the study's authors.
Another study indicated that continuous exposure to UV radiation could harm the hair cuticle, which can also contribute to hair breakage and weakening. This study was also reported in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology. As a UV filter, benzophenone-4 might exacerbate this harm. Use hair care products that contain moisturising and strengthening elements to reduce the potentially detrimental effects of benzophenone-4 on the hair. This could include organic oils like coconut or argan oil or proteins like keratin or collagen. Additionally, regularly applying a deep conditioning treatment or hair mask can keep the hair moisturised and robust.
