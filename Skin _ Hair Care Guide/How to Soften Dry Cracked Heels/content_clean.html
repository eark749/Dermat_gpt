<p><span>Several natural oils can help heal cracked heels by moisturising and nourishing the skin. Here are some options to consider:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Coconut Oil</b><span>: Coconut oil contains fatty acids that penetrate deeply into the skin, providing intense <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hyaluronic-skinbooster-serum">hydration</a>. Apply liberally to your heels before bedtime and cover with socks to let the oil work overnight.</span></p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sweet Almond Oil</b><span>: Sweet almond oil is the perfect remedy for dry, cracked skin because it is absorbable and lightweight. It has vitamin E, which nourishes and repairs skin that has been damaged. Massage it into your heels daily to keep them soft and supple.</span></p>
</li>

</li>

<h3><b>Exfoliation techniques for smoother heels</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Exfoliation techniques for smoother heels" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Exfoliation_techniques_for_smoother_heels_480x480.jpg?v=1712146609"/></div>
<p><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/exfoliation%20">Exfoliation</a> is essential for removing dead skin cells and achieving smoother heels. Here are some effective exfoliation techniques to get smoother heels:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Pumice Stone</b><span>: A pumice stone is a natural volcanic rock that is excellent for exfoliating rough skin on heels. Soak your feet in warm water for 5-10 minutes to soften their skin. Wet the pumice stone and gently rub it across the heels in a circular motion. Continue exfoliating until you have removed enough dead skin. Rinse your feet with water and pat dry. Use a moisturiser or foot cream to hydrate the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Foot Scrubs</b><span>: You can make your foot scrub by combining sugar, salt, coffee grounds, and oatmeal. Mix two tablespoons of coconut oil or olive oil with one-fourth cup of granulated sugar or salt. Add a few drops of essential oil for fragrance. Gently massage the scrub into damp heels in circular motions. Concentrate on the areas with rough, dry skin. Rinse thoroughly with water, pat dry, and apply moisturiser.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Foot Files and Pedicure Tools</b><span>: These tools are specifically designed to remove calluses and dead skin from the feet. They usually have a rough surface that rubs away dry, rough patches. Use them on dry skin and follow the instructions that come with the tool.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Chemical Exfoliants</b><span>: Exfoliants containing alpha hydroxy acids (<a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/aha-bha-range">AHAs</a>) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) can aid in the removal of dead skin cells and promote smoother heels. Look for products with ingredients such as glycolic acid, lactic acid, or salicylic acid. Follow the product's instructions carefully and avoid excessive exfoliation, especially if you have sensitive skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Exfoliating Socks or Foot Masks</b><span>: These products contain ingredients such as AHAs or enzymes, which exfoliate the skin over time. Simply wear the socks or foot masks as directed and let the exfoliating ingredients do their magic.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Regardless of the exfoliation technique you use, moisturise your heels afterwards to keep the skin hydrated and prevent further dryness. Consistency is key, so exfoliate your heels regularly, especially if they become dry and rough quickly.</span></p>
<h2><b>Preventative Strategies to Avoid Cracked Heels</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Preventative Strategies to Avoid Cracked Heels" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Preventative_Strategies_to_Avoid_Cracked_Heels_480x480.jpg?v=1712146650"/></div>
<p><span>Preventing cracked heels requires a combination of regular foot care and lifestyle changes. Here are some preventative strategies to help you avoid cracked heels:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Keeping your feet well-moisturized is key to preventing cracked heels. Apply a thick moisturizer or foot cream daily, especially after bathing or showering, to lock in moisture and keep the skin soft and supple.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Regular <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/best-exfoliants-for-face-skin">exfoliation</a> removes dead skin cells from the heels, preventing the buildup of dry, rough patches that can lead to cracks. Use a pumice stone, foot scrub, or foot file to gently exfoliate your heels at least once or twice a week.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated from the inside out. Hydrated skin is less likely to become dry and cracked. Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day, or more if you're physically active or in a dry climate.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Avoid wearing shoes that are too tight or have thin soles, as they can cause pressure and friction on the heels, leading to dryness and cracking. Opt for supportive, well-fitting shoes with cushioned soles to reduce pressure on your feet.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Wear socks or slippers at home to keep your feet warm on cold floors and rough surfaces. Avoid walking barefoot in public places because it increases the risk of injury or infection.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>If your job or lifestyle requires long periods of standing or walking, take regular breaks to rest your feet. Elevate your feet while sitting to reduce swelling and improve circulation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Eat a well-balanced diet rich in vitamins and nutrients, such as vitamins A, C, and E, zinc, and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/omega-3-fatty-acid-skin-benefits">omega-3 fatty acids</a>, all of which promote skin health. Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats in your daily diet.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Apply a thick layer of moisturiser or petroleum jelly to your heels before bedtime, then cover with clean cotton socks to keep moisture in. This softens the skin and keeps it from becoming too dry.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Diabetes, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/eczema">eczema</a>, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/psoriasis">psoriasis</a>, and thyroid disorders are all medical conditions that can increase your risk of cracked heels. Manage these conditions effectively with the assistance of your healthcare provider to reduce the risk of complications.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>By incorporating these preventive measures into your daily routine, you can keep your heels soft, smooth, and crack-free. If you notice any signs of cracked heels despite taking preventive measures, treat them right away to avoid further complications.</span></p>
<h3><b>Importance of hydration for foot health</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Importance of hydration for foot health" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/35_1_480x480.jpg?v=1712149087"/></div>
<p><span>Hydration is important for foot health for a variety of reasons, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Skin Moisture</b><span>: Proper hydration is required to maintain the moisture balance in the skin of the feet. When the skin is dehydrated, it becomes dry, cracked, and susceptible to conditions such as fissures and calluses. By staying hydrated, you help keep the skin on your feet soft, supple, and less prone to damage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Prevention of Cracked Heels</b><span>: Dehydration can exacerbate cracked heels, which are a common problem. When the skin lacks moisture, it becomes dry and less elastic, making it more susceptible to cracking, especially in areas of pressure or friction. By staying well-hydrated, you can help prevent cracked heels and maintain the overall health of your feet.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reduced Risk of Foot Conditions</b><span>: Dehydration can lead to a variety of foot issues, including athlete's foot and fungal nail infections. Moist, warm environments are ideal for fungi and bacteria growth. By staying hydrated and keeping your feet clean and dry, you can reduce the risk of these infections.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Improved Circulation</b><span>: Proper hydration promotes healthy blood circulation, which is necessary for delivering oxygen and nutrients to the tissues of the feet. Good circulation promotes tissue repair, reduces inflammation, and speeds up healing in the event of an injury or wound.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Prevention of Foot Cramps</b><span>: Dehydration can cause muscle cramps, including those in the feet. Muscles require adequate hydration to function optimally, and dehydration can disrupt the electrolyte balance required for muscle contraction and relaxation. By staying hydrated, you can help prevent foot cramps and maintain muscle function.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Swelling Relief</b><span>: Drinking plenty of water can help prevent fluid retention and swelling in the feet and ankles, especially in hot weather or after long periods of standing or sitting. Proper hydration supports the body's natural fluid balance mechanisms, lowering the risk of foot discomfort and swelling.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Support for Overall Health</b><span>: Hydration is essential for overall health and well-being, including foot health. Drinking plenty of water helps all body systems function properly, including those responsible for keeping your feet healthy.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Proper foot care and hygiene practices</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Proper foot care and hygiene practices" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Proper_foot_care_and_hygiene_practices_480x480.jpg?v=1712146758"/></div>
<p><span>Proper foot care and hygiene are essential for keeping your feet healthy and happy. Here are some important practices to include in your daily routine:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Keep Your Feet Clean</b><span>: Wash your feet every day with warm water and a mild soap. Scrub dirt and dead skin cells away with a soft cloth or brush, paying special attention to the area between the toes, where bacteria and fungi thrive. Make sure to completely dry your feet, paying special attention to the spaces between your toes.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Trim Toenails Regularly</b><span>: To avoid ingrown toenails, trim your toenails straight across rather than too short. Use clean, sanitised nail clippers to smooth the edges of the nails. Trim your nails after bathing, when they are softer and easier to cut.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Moisturise Daily</b><span>: Apply a moisturising cream or lotion to your feet daily, paying special attention to dry areas like the heels and soles. Moisturising protects against dry, cracked skin and keeps your feet soft and supple. Avoid using moisturiser between your toes, as this can create a damp environment that encourages fungal growth. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Wear Clean Socks and Shoes</b><span>: Change your socks every day, especially if your feet sweat excessively. Opt for socks made of moisture-wicking materials like cotton or bamboo to keep your feet dry. Rotate your shoes to allow them to air out and dry completely between wears. Consider using antifungal powders or sprays inside your shoes to prevent fungal infections.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Choose Proper Footwear</b><span>: Wear comfortable shoes and provide adequate support for your feet. Avoid shoes with too tight or narrow toe boxes, which can cause friction, pressure, and foot deformities. Choose breathable shoes made of natural materials that promote air circulation and reduce moisture buildup.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Protect Your Feet</b><span>: To reduce the risk of fungal infections like athlete's foot, wear protective footwear in public places such as swimming pools, gyms, and communal showers. Use flip-flops or shower shoes to protect your feet from potentially contaminated surfaces.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Inspect Your Feet Daily</b><span>: Examine your feet for signs of redness, swelling, cuts, blisters, or other abnormalities. Address any issues as soon as possible by cleaning and applying antiseptic ointment, or seek medical attention if necessary, especially if you have diabetes or other conditions that impair circulation or wound healing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Practice Good Foot Hygiene in Public Places</b><span>: To reduce the risk of infection, avoid walking barefoot in public areas such as locker rooms, saunas or hotel rooms. Use your towel, and do not share personal items such as nail clippers or shoes with others.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>By incorporating these foot care and hygiene practices into your daily routine, you can help keep your feet healthy and comfortable while avoiding common foot problems and infections. If you are concerned about your foot health or notice any persistent problems, see a healthcare professional for an evaluation and treatment.</span></p>
<h3><b>Choosing the right footwear to prevent cracked heels</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Choosing the right footwear to prevent cracked heels" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Choosing_the_right_footwear_to_prevent_cracked_heels_480x480.jpg?v=1712148723"/></div>
<p><span>To avoid cracked heels, choosing the appropriate shoes is vital. The following advice will help you select shoes that will maintain the health and hydration of your heels:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Choose shoes that fit properly and give your feet enough support. Shoes that are excessively tight or loose can press and rub against the heels, causing dryness and cracking. Make sure the toe box has adequate room to avoid being crowded or rubbing against the heels.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Look for shoes that provide adequate cushioning and support, particularly in the heel area. Cushioned insoles and shock-absorbing materials can help reduce the impact on your heels and minimise the risk of developing cracks. Consider adding orthotic inserts if you need extra support or have specific foot conditions.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Choose shoes made of breathable materials such as leather or mesh, which promote air circulation and prevent moisture buildup. Breathable shoes help to keep your feet dry and reduce the likelihood of fungal infections and skin irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>While sandals and open-back shoes are fashionable, they typically provide little support and expose your heels to friction and dryness. Choose closed-back shoes or sandals with supportive straps to keep your feet securely in place.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>High heels can put too much pressure on the heels, leading to dryness and cracking. Choose shoes with low or moderate heels to reduce foot strain and the risk of cracking.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Wear moisture-wicking socks made from cotton or bamboo, which absorb sweat and keep your feet dry. Moisture-wicking socks can help prevent excess moisture buildup, which can lead to cracked heels.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Avoid wearing the same shoes every day. Rotate your shoes regularly so they can air out and dry completely between wears. Moisture trapped inside shoes softens the skin, making it more susceptible to cracking.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Choose footwear that is appropriate for your planned activity. For exercise and activities that require prolonged standing or walking, wear supportive athletic shoes. Avoid going barefoot on hard or rough surfaces to prevent friction and injury to the heels.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>By selecting footwear that fits well, provides adequate support and cushioning, and promotes proper airflow, you can help prevent cracked heels and maintain the overall health of your feet. If you're prone to cracked heels, consider consulting a podiatrist for personalised recommendations and treatment options.</span></p>
<h2><b>Advanced Treatments for Severe Cracked Heels</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Advanced Treatments for Severe Cracked Heels" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Advanced_Treatments_for_Severe_Cracked_Heels_480x480.jpg?v=1712148754"/></div>
<p><span>Severe cases of cracked heels may necessitate advanced treatments to effectively heal the skin and avoid further complications. Here are some cutting-edge therapies that a medical expert might suggest:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Prescription Medications</b><span>: To reduce inflammation and promote healing in cases of severe dryness or infection, a healthcare provider may prescribe topical medications such as corticosteroid creams or ointments. A fungal infection may necessitate the use of antifungal creams or oral antifungal medications.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Urea Creams</b><span>: Urea is a keratolytic agent that softens and removes thick, dry skin. Urea creams are available over the counter or by prescription and can be used to treat severe cracked heels. These creams work by increasing the skin's water content and promoting exfoliation of dead cells.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Salicylic Acid Treatments</b><span>: Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid that exfoliates dead skin cells and softens rough, thickened skin. Salicylic acid treatments, such as medicated pads or creams, can be used on the heels to remove dead skin and promote healing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Laser Therapy</b><span>: Laser therapy can be used to treat severe cracked heels by stimulating skin regeneration and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/collagen">collagen</a> production. Laser treatments can help improve skin texture and reduce the depth of cracks, leading to smoother, healthier-looking heels.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Chemical Peels</b><span>: Chemical peels containing alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) can exfoliate the skin and promote cell turnover, which may be beneficial for severely cracked heels. Chemical peels can soften rough, thickened skin and improve the overall appearance of your heels.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Paraffin Wax Treatment</b><span>: Warm paraffin wax is applied to the feet to hydrate and soften the skin. The wax forms a protective layer over the skin, allowing moisture to penetrate deeply and promote healing. Paraffin wax treatments can be done at home or in a spa setting.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Foot Soaks and Exfoliation</b><span>: Advanced foot soaks with ingredients such as Epsom salt, apple cider vinegar, or essential oils can help soften thickened skin and promote healing. Exfoliating treatments, such as chemical peels or microdermabrasion, can help remove dead skin cells and smooth rough <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">spots</a> on the heels.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Custom Orthotics</b><span>: If cracked heels are caused by underlying foot deformities or biomechanical issues, custom orthotic inserts may be prescribed to provide support and redistribute pressure on the feet. Orthotics can help correct gait abnormalities and relieve excess pressure on the heels, lowering the risk of cracking.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>For the proper diagnosis and treatment of severe cracked heels, see a healthcare professional, such as a dermatologist or podiatrist. They can determine the underlying cause of the condition and recommend treatments to meet your specific requirements. Furthermore, practicing good foot hygiene and moisturising regularly can help prevent future cases of cracked heels.</span></p>
<h3><b>Professional podiatric treatments for cracked heels</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Professional podiatric treatments for cracked heels" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Professional_podiatric_treatments_for_cracked_heels_480x480.jpg?v=1712148794"/></div>
<p><span>Podiatrists are trained to diagnose and treat a variety of foot conditions, including cracked heels. Here are some professional podiatric treatments that may be recommended for cracked heels:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Debridement</b><span>: Podiatrists can perform debridement, which involves removing thickened, dead skin from the heels using specialized instruments. This process helps smooth the skin and reduce the depth of cracks, allowing for better healing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Prescription Medications</b><span>: In cases of severe dryness or infection, podiatrists may prescribe topical medications, such as corticosteroid creams, to reduce inflammation and promote healing. Antifungal creams or oral antifungal medications may be prescribed if a fungal infection is present.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Urea-Based Creams</b><span>: Podiatrists may recommend urea-based creams, which are available over-the-counter or by prescription, to soften and exfoliate thickened, dry skin on the heels. Urea helps increase the water content of the skin and promotes exfoliation of dead skin cells, facilitating healing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Custom Orthotics</b><span>: If underlying foot deformities or biomechanical issues contribute to cracked heels, podiatrists may prescribe custom orthotic inserts to provide support and redistribute pressure on the feet. Orthotics can help address gait abnormalities and relieve excessive pressure on the heels, reducing the risk of developing cracks.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Laser Therapy</b><span>: Laser therapy may be used to treat severe cases of cracked heels by promoting skin regeneration and collagen production. Laser treatments can help improve skin texture and reduce the depth of cracks, leading to smoother, healthier-looking heels.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Chemical Peels</b><span>: Podiatrists can perform chemical peels containing alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) to help exfoliate the skin and promote cell turnover. Chemical peels can help soften rough, thickened skin and improve the overall appearance of the heels.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Moisture-Retaining Dressings</b><span>: Podiatrists may apply moisture-retaining dressings to the heels to help hydrate and protect the skin. These dressings create a barrier over the skin, allowing moisture to penetrate deeply and promote healing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Education and Prevention</b><span>: Podiatrists can provide education on proper foot care techniques and preventive measures to help patients avoid future episodes of cracked heels. This may include recommendations for appropriate footwear, moisturizing routines, and regular foot hygiene practices.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It's important to consult a podiatrist for proper diagnosis and treatment of cracked heels, especially if they are severe or recurrent. Podiatrists can assess the underlying cause of the condition and recommend personalised treatment options to address your specific needs. Additionally, maintaining good foot hygiene and following a regular moisturizing routine can help prevent future episodes of cracked heels.</span></p>
<h3><b>The role of custom orthotics in managing foot health</b></h3>
<div><img alt="The role of custom orthotics in managing foot health" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/The_role_of_custom_orthotics_in_managing_foot_health_480x480.jpg?v=1712148823"/></div>
<p><span>Custom orthotics play an important role in foot health management by supporting, stabilising, and aligning the feet and lower limbs. Here are a few ways that custom orthotics help with overall foot health:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Custom orthotics are specifically designed to support the arches of the feet, thereby distributing body weight more evenly and reducing stress on the feet, ankles, knees, hips, and lower back. By supporting the arches, orthotics can help prevent overpronation (excessive inward rolling of the foot) or supination (excessive outward rolling), which can lead to various foot problems and injuries.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Custom orthotics assist in the proper alignment of the feet, ankles, and lower limbs while standing, walking, and running. Proper alignment lowers the risk of biomechanical issues like flat feet, high arches, and abnormal gait patterns, which can all lead to foot pain, instability, and injury.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Orthotics can redistribute pressure on the feet by cushioning and padding areas with high pressure or friction. This relieves the pain and discomfort caused by conditions such as plantar fasciitis, metatarsalgia, and heel spurs, allowing for greater comfort and mobility.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Custom orthotics can absorb shock and impact forces generated during weight-bearing activities like walking or running. By absorbing shock, orthotics help reduce strain on the muscles, tendons, and joints of the feet and lower limbs, which can help prevent overuse injuries and fatigue.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Orthotics can help correct or accommodate foot deformities like bunions, hammertoes, and claw toes by providing individualised support and realignment. By addressing underlying structural issues, orthotics can help improve foot function and reduce pain and discomfort associated with deformities.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Custom orthotics can help to prevent injuries by stabilising and supporting the feet and lower limbs during physical activities. By optimising biomechanics and reducing excessive motion, orthotics can help reduce the risk of common injuries such as stress fractures, tendonitis, and sprains.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Athletes and active individuals can benefit from custom orthotics by improving biomechanical efficiency, reducing fatigue, and enhancing performance during sports and exercise. Orthotics can improve foot function and mechanics, resulting in better balance, agility, and power transfer.</span></p>
</li>
