Squalene is thought to account for 10 to 12 percent of your skin's oil. It is extremely important for your skin. Unfortunately, because of its effectiveness, it is frequently harvested in unethical ways—however, as long as you are responsible about where you get it, everything is fine. It can and is commonly obtained from plants such as olives, wheat germ oil, and rice bran. Squalene and squalane are the two forms of the ingredient. Overall, squalene's moisturizing, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, and healing properties make it a good ingredient for skincare products.
What is Squalene?
Squalene is a natural organic substance that can be found in a wide variety of living things, including people, plants, and animals. It contains six isoprene units and is a triterpene, a type of hydrocarbon. Squalene is a colourless, odourless, and non-toxic substance that is soluble in the majority of organic solvents but insoluble in water.
Squalene plays a variety of roles in living organisms. It is a precursor to other compounds in plants, such as steroids and triterpenes. It is a precursor to cholesterol and other important compounds in animals. It is found in the skin of humans and helps to moisturise and protect it from damage. Squalene is also used in the manufacture of dietary supplements, cosmetics, and some vaccine adjuvants. Here are some important features and benefits of squalene in skincare:
Squalene is a highly effective moisturiser that deeply hydrates the skin without leaving a greasy residue. It creates a protective barrier on the skin's surface, preventing moisture loss while keeping the skin soft and supple.
Squalene's light texture allows it to absorb quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling smooth and silky. It softens and soothes dry, rough, or irritated skin, making it an excellent addition to skincare products such as moisturisers, serums, and creams.
Despite being an oil-based ingredient, squalene is non-comedogenic, which means it does not
clog pores
or cause acne breakouts. It is suitable for all skin types, including oily and acne-prone skin, as it moisturises without causing congestion or irritation.
Squalene contains antioxidants, which help to protect the skin from free radical damage caused by UV radiation, pollution, and other environmental stressors. It helps to neutralize harmful molecules and reduce the signs of aging, such as fine lines, wrinkles, and sunspots.
Squalene is anti-inflammatory, which helps to soothe and calm irritated or inflamed skin. It can relieve redness, itching, and sensitivity, making it ideal for people who have sensitive or reactive skin.
Squalene is compatible with a wide variety of skincare ingredients and formulations, making it an adaptable addition to skincare products. It can boost the effectiveness of other active ingredients while providing gentle, nourishing hydration.
Is Squalene Good for Skin?
Yes, squalene can be good for the skin. Squalene is a natural compound that is produced by the sebaceous glands in our skin. It is also found in certain plant sources, such as
olives
, rice bran, and wheat germ. Squalene has moisturizing and hydrating properties that can benefit the skin's overall health and appearance. It can aid in the improvement of skin texture, the reduction of
fine lines and wrinkles
, and the protection of the skin from environmental stressors such as pollution and UV rays.
Squalene is also a natural antioxidant that can help to protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals. It can also help to strengthen the
skin's natural barrier
function, which can help to prevent moisture loss and keep the skin hydrated. Here's why squalene is good for your skin:
Squalene
is a highly effective moisturiser that deeply hydrates the skin without feeling heavy or greasy. It is lightweight and quickly penetrates the skin, leaving it soft, smooth, and nourished. Squalene replenishes lost moisture and restores the skin's natural barrier function, making it particularly useful for dry or dehydrated skin.
Despite being an oil-based ingredient, squalene is non-comedogenic, which means it will not clog pores or cause acne breakouts. It is suitable for all skin types, including oily and acne-prone skin, as it moisturises without causing congestion or irritation.

It's worth noting that squalene is sometimes confused with squalane, which is a hydrogenated and more stable version of squalene. Squalane is also used in skincare products for its moisturizing and hydrating properties, as well as its ability to improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Squalane vs Squalene
Squalene and squalane are two related organic compounds that are commonly used in skincare products. Here's a brief overview of each:
Squalene is an unsaturated hydrocarbon that is naturally produced by the sebaceous glands in our skin. It is also found in shark liver oil and certain plant oils, such as olive oil, wheat germ oil, and rice bran oil. Squalene has been shown to have antioxidant properties and can help to moisturize and protect the skin. However, squalene is unstable and can easily oxidize when exposed to air, which can lead to skin irritation.
Squalane, on the other hand, is a saturated form of squalene that is more stable and less prone to oxidation. Squalane is often derived from squalene, usually from plant sources like sugarcane, olives, and rice bran. Though less likely to irritate the skin, it has similar moisturizing and protective qualities to squalene.  Squalane is commonly used in skincare products as an emollient, which helps to keep the skin soft and hydrated.
In conclusion, squalane is a more stable and soothing derivative of squalene that is frequently found in skincare products. Squalene is a natural substance produced by the skin and found in some plant oils.
How to Use Squalene in Your Skincare Routine
Squalene is a typical component of many plants and animals, including human skin. It is a naturally occurring organic substance. It can be easily incorporated into your skincare routine and is frequently used in skincare products due to its moisturizing and antioxidant properties. Here are some ways to use squalene in your skincare routine:
Use a squalene-based moisturizer
: Look for a
moisturizer
that contains squalene as one of its key ingredients. The skin can be hydrated and shielded from environmental stressors with the help of squalene, which is easily absorbed by the skin.
Add squalene to your existing skincare products
: If you have a favorite serum or moisturizer, you can add a few drops of pure squalene oil to it. The moisturizing and anti-aging qualities of your current products may be improved as a result.
Use a squalene-based facial oil
: Facial oils are a great way to provide your skin with an extra boost of hydration and nourishment. Look for a facial oil that contains squalene as one of its key ingredients.
Apply squalene before using retinol
: In your skincare routine, using squalene prior to retinol can help reduce dryness and irritation. Squalene can help soothe and hydrate the skin, making it more receptive to
retinol
.
Use squalene as a spot treatment
: If you have dry or irritated patches of skin, you can apply a small amount of pure squalene oil to the affected area. This can help soothe and hydrate the skin and promote healing.
When using squalene in your skincare routine, it's important to choose a high-quality product and start with a small amount to ensure that your skin doesn't have any adverse reactions. If you have any concerns, it's always best to speak with a dermatologist before incorporating a new product into your routine.
Squalene for Acne Prone Skin
Squalene is a natural oil that is found in our skin and in certain plants and animals. It has become a popular ingredient in skincare products due to its moisturizing properties and ability to mimic the skin's natural oils. While there is some evidence that squalene can be beneficial for
acne-prone skin
, it is important to note that everyone's skin is different, and what works for one person may not work for another.
One of the benefits of using squalene for acne-prone skin is that it is
non-comedogenic
, which means it does not
clog pores
. This can be particularly beneficial for those with oily or acne-prone skin who may be hesitant to use heavier, oil-based products. However, it's important to note that while squalene is generally considered safe, it can still cause irritation or allergic reactions in some individuals. As with any new skincare product, it's a good idea to do a patch test before applying it to your entire face.
Overall, incorporating squalene into your skincare routine may be beneficial for acne-prone skin, but it's important to
consult with a dermatologist
or skincare professional for personalized advice.
Squalene for Oily Skin
Squalene has been traditionally used as a moisturizing agent for dry and
ageing skin
, it can also be beneficial for oily skin. One of the reasons why squalene is beneficial for oily skin is that it is a natural antioxidant. It helps to protect the skin from
free radical
damage, which is a common problem for people with oily skin. Squalene is also non-comedogenic, which means it does not clog pores, making it a great choice for people with oily or acne-prone skin.
Another benefit of squalene is that it can help to regulate sebum production. While sebum is necessary to keep the skin moisturized, excess sebum can lead to oily skin and acne. Squalene can help to balance the production of sebum, reducing the appearance of oily skin.
Many skincare products contain squalene, such as
moisturisers
, serums, and facial oils. Look for products with squalene as an ingredient if you have oily skin. It is important to note, however, that not all squalene products are created equal. Some are obtained from animals, while others are obtained from plants. If you're vegan or have ethical concerns, you should look for a squalene product made from plants. Additionally, before applying any new product to your entire face, test it on a small area of the skin.
Who Should Use Squalene?
Squalene is a naturally occurring organic compound found in plants, animals, and humans. It is used in a variety of products due to its moisturising, emollient, and antioxidant properties.
One of the most common applications for squalene is in skincare and personal care products like moisturisers, serums, and

Squalene's antioxidant properties make it useful in a variety of food products, including nutritional supplements and functional foods. It may help to protect the body from oxidative damage, which has been linked to a variety of health issues such as cancer, heart disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. Below is a breakdown of who can benefit from using squalene in their skincare routine:
Dry or dehydrated skin types
: Squalene is an excellent moisturiser that deeply hydrates the skin without feeling greasy or heavy.  It is especially beneficial for people with dry or dehydrated skin because it replenishes lost moisture and restores the skin's natural barrier function.
Sensitive Skin Types
: Squalene is a good choice for reactive or sensitive skin types because it is non-comedogenic and non-irritating.  It lessens redness and inflammation without aggravating already-irritated skin. It also helps to soothe and calm it.
Ageing Skin
: As we get older, the lipid barrier in our skin naturally weakens, which causes it to become more dry and less elastic.  Squalene can restore these depleted lipids, enhancing skin hydration and diminishing the visibility of wrinkles and fine lines.
Skin Prone to Acne
: Squalene is an oil-based ingredient, but it is non-comedogenic, meaning it is unlikely to clog pores or worsen acne.  Squalene's lightweight texture and anti-inflammatory properties make it ideal for acne-prone skin, keeping it hydrated without causing breakouts.
Combination Skin
: Squalene helps balance oil production and provides lightweight hydration, so even those with combination skin can benefit from using it. Squalene absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving a greasy residue, making it suitable for all areas of the face.
Sun-Damaged Skin
: Squalene is a naturally occurring antioxidant that aids in shielding the skin from UV ray damage and other environmental stressors that can cause free radical damage.  Squalene can help prevent and repair sun damage, giving your complexion a healthier, more youthful appearance when used regularly.
Anyone Looking for a Lightweight Moisturizer
: Whether you have specific skin concerns or just want to keep your skin healthy and hydrated, squalene is an excellent lightweight moisturiser. It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling soft, smooth, and nourished.
In addition, squalene is sometimes used as an adjuvant in vaccines to enhance the body's immune response to the vaccine. It has been used in some flu vaccines, as well as in COVID-19 vaccines developed by some pharmaceutical companies.
However, it's important to note that some squalene used in consumer products may come from animal sources, such as shark liver oil, which can have negative impacts on the environment and wildlife populations. If you are concerned about the sourcing of squalene in the products you use, it's best to do your research and choose products that use sustainable and ethical sourcing methods.
Combining Squalene with Other Skincare Ingredients
Combining squalene with other skincare ingredients can increase its effectiveness and address a variety of skin concerns. Squalene is a natural moisturising agent that mimics the skin's lipid structure, making it appropriate for all skin types, including sensitive and acne-prone skin. For maximum efficacy, combine squalene with the following skincare ingredients:
Hyaluronic Acid
: Hyaluronic acid is a hydrating ingredient that draws and holds moisture in the skin.  The combination of squalene and hyaluronic acid helps to deeply hydrate the skin, plump up fine lines and wrinkles, and improve overall skin texture and elasticity.
Vitamin C
: Rich in antioxidants, vitamin C lightens skin tone, minimises hyperpigmentation, and increases collagen synthesis.  In combination with squalene, it promotes a more youthful and radiant complexion while shielding the skin from environmental damage.
Retinol
: Retinol, a type of vitamin A, is well known for its anti-aging qualities. These qualities include accelerating the production of collagen, decreasing the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles, and increasing cell turnover.  Squalene adds extra hydration and can help reduce any possible retinol irritation.
Niacinamide
: Also referred to as vitamin B3, niacinamide has several advantages for skincare, such as enhancing the function of the skin's barrier, lowering inflammation, and lessening the visibility of pores.  Targeting several issues at once, niacinamide and squalene together can help calm and nourish the skin.
Ceramides
: Lipid molecules called ceramides to aid in fortifying the skin's barrier and preventing moisture loss.  Ceramides are enhanced by squalene, which has additional emollient qualities, leaving the skin barrier more resilient and hydrated.
Antioxidants
: When combined with squalene, antioxidants such as coenzyme Q10, resveratrol, or green tea extract help to neutralise free radicals, guard against UV damage, and support general skin health.
Peptides
: Peptides are chains of amino acids that promote the synthesis of collagen and enhance the firmness and elasticity of the skin.  Over time, peptides and squalene combined can improve the skin's natural repair mechanism and lessen the appearance of wrinkles.
Essential Oils
: Certain essential oils, like chamomile, rosehip, or lavender, provide extra skincare advantages like reducing redness, easing inflammation, and encouraging relaxation.  They can be used safely to treat certain skin issues when diluted with squalene.
When combining skincare ingredients, it's essential to consider compatibility, concentration, and potential interactions. Patch testing new products or formulations on a small area of skin before full application is always recommended, especially if you have sensitive or reactive skin. Additionally, consulting with a dermatologist or skincare professional can help you tailor a regimen that addresses your unique skin concerns and goals.
Squalene vs Hyaluronic Acid
Squalene and hyaluronic acid are both commonly used skincare ingredients, but they serve different functions and have distinct properties.
Squalene
:
Squalene is a naturally occurring compound found in human sebum (skin oil) and certain plant oils such as olive oil, wheat germ oil, and rice bran oil.
It is an excellent emollient, which means it moisturizes and softens the skin by preventing moisture loss. Squalene also contains antioxidants, which can help protect the skin from free radicals.
Squalene is recognised for its moisturizing and nourishing properties. It can help maintain the skin's moisture barrier, making it especially useful for dry or dehydrated skin.
Squalene is widely used in skincare products like moisturisers, serums, and facial oils.
Hyaluronic Acid
:
Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring substance in the human body, particularly in connective tissues, skin, and the eyes. However, hyaluronic acid used in skincare products is frequently derived from natural sources such as rooster combs or manufactured synthetically.
Hyaluronic acid is a humectant, which means that it attracts and holds moisture. It can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, making it extremely hydrating for the skin.
Hyaluronic acid plumps the skin, reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and increases skin elasticity. It also helps keep skin hydrated, giving it a supple and dewy appearance.
Hyaluronic acid is a common ingredient in moisturizers, serums, and other skincare products that aim to hydrate and plump the skin.
Both squalene and hyaluronic acid provide hydration benefits to the skin; they work in different ways and can be combined in skincare routines to improve hydration and overall skin health. Squalene focuses on moisturising and protecting the skin barrier, whereas hyaluronic acid attracts and retains moisture, giving the skin a plump and hydrated appearance.
Squalene and Retinol
Squalene and retinol are both organic compounds that are commonly used in skincare and cosmetic products.
Squalene is a natural organic compound that is found in high concentrations in the livers of sharks and small amounts in olives and other plant oils. Squalene is a common ingredient in skincare products because it is an excellent moisturizer and emollient that can soften and smooth the skin. Squalene is also an antioxidant and has been shown to help protect the skin from free radical damage. Retinol, on the other hand, is a form of vitamin A that is used in many anti-aging skincare products. Retinol can help to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, as well as improve skin texture and tone. It works by stimulating collagen production and increasing cell turnover, which can help improve the overall health and appearance of the skin.
Squalene and retinol are two skincare ingredients that can complement each other well when used together. Here's how they work individually and why they can be beneficial when combined:
Squalene
:
Squalene is a natural emollient that deeply moisturises the skin without leaving a greasy residue. It mimics the skin's natural oils, which helps to keep the moisture barrier intact and prevent dehydration.
Despite being an oil-based ingredient, squalene is not comedogenic, which means it will not clog pores or worsen acne. It is suitable for all skin types, including oily and acne-prone skin, because it provides lightweight hydration without clogging pores.
Squalene contains antioxidants that help protect the skin from environmental damage and free radicals. It can help reduce the appearance of ageing, such as fine lines and wrinkles, by neutralising harmful molecules.
Retinol
:
Retinol, a vitamin A derivative, is well-known for its ability to stimulate collagen production in the skin. Collagen is necessary for skin firmness, elasticity, and youthful appearance. Regular use of retinol can help reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin.
Retinol stimulates the skin's natural exfoliation process, promoting the removal of dead skin cells and the formation of newer, healthier ones. This can help to improve skin texture, minimise pore size, and even out skin tone.
Retinol can help regulate oil production and prevent acne lesions by clearing pores and reducing inflammation. Individuals with acne-prone skin are frequently advised to incorporate it into their skincare regimen.
Due to their capacity to enhance skin health and appearance, retinol and squalene are both frequently found in skincare products. However, it is important to note that some people may experience skin irritation or other side effects from using these products, so it is always a good idea to do a patch test before applying them to your entire face. Additionally, it is important to follow the instructions provided with the product and use it as directed to achieve the best results.
Squalene with Vitamin C
Combining squalene and vitamin C can result in a potent skincare duo that addresses multiple skin concerns and offers numerous benefits. Here's how these two ingredients function together:
Hydration
: Squalene is an excellent moisturiser that deeply hydrates the skin without feeling heavy or greasy.  It creates a protective barrier on the skin's surface, preventing moisture loss while keeping the skin supple and soft.
Antioxidant Protection
: Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that aids in the neutralisation of free radicals, which are harmful molecules that can damage the skin and accelerate the ageing process.  By including vitamin C in your skincare routine, you can protect your skin from environmental stressors such as UV radiation and pollution.
Brightening
: Vitamin C is known for its brightening properties, which can help fade dark spots, hyperpigmentation, and uneven skin tones.  Regular use of vitamin C can result in a more radiant and even complexion, while squalene keeps the skin hydrated and healthy-looking.
Collagen Synthesis
: Vitamin C is necessary for collagen synthesis, which keeps the skin firm, plump, and youthful.  By combining squalene and vitamin C, you can stimulate collagen production while also maintaining skin elasticity and firmness over time.
Anti-inflammatory
: Squalene and vitamin C both have anti-inflammatory properties that can help soothe and calm irritated or inflamed skin.  This makes them ideal for sensitive or acne-prone skin because they can help reduce redness and inflammation.
When combining squalene and vitamin C, it is critical to use stable formulations that retain the efficacy of both ingredients. Look for products containing a stable form of vitamin C, such as ascorbic acid, tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, or magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, which are less likely to degrade and oxidise when exposed to air or light. Squalene and vitamin C can be added to your skincare regimen either separately or by selecting a product that combines both of these nutrients. For extra antioxidant protection and brightening effects, you could, for instance, use a vitamin C serum or cream on top of your morning moisturiser containing squalene. As an alternative, you might search for a product that, for ease of use and simplicity, combines vitamin C and squalene in one formulation.
Takeaway: Get Clearer Skin with Natural Antioxidant and Natural Emollient Squalene
Squalene is a natural organic compound that is found in high concentrations in shark liver oil but can also be extracted from various plant sources such as olives, rice bran, and amaranth seed. It is a natural emollient that is used in skincare products to moisturize and soften the skin.
