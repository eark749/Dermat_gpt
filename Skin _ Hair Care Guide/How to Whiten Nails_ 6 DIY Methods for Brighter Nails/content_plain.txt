In this blog, we'll look at six DIY nail whitening methods: lemon juice soak, baking soda scrub, hydrogen peroxide soak, whitening toothpaste rub, vinegar soak, and bleach bath.
The Science of Nail Discoloration: Causes and Prevention
Nail discoloration can be caused by several factors, and understanding the root causes can aid in prevention and treatment. Here's an overview of the science behind nail discoloration, including causes and prevention strategies.
Causes of Nail Discoloration
:
Fungi such as dermatophytes and moulds can infect the nails, causing yellowing or a greenish tint. Fungal infections thrive in warm, moist environments, making nails vulnerable, especially if damaged or exposed to such conditions frequently.
Injuries to the nail bed can cause discoloration because blood or debris become trapped beneath the nail. This frequently results in a dark purplish or blackish coloration known as subungual hematoma.
Psoriasis, an autoimmune disorder, can cause changes in nail colour, texture, and shape. Nail psoriasis can cause yellowish-brown discoloration, pitting, and separation of the nail from its bed.
Exposure to harsh chemicals found in nail polish, removers, and other nail care products can cause discoloration over time. These chemicals can cause yellowing and brittleness of the nails.
Smoking can cause yellowish nails due to the nicotine and tar found in cigarettes. Prolonged smoking can also harm nail health, resulting in discoloration and other problems.
Certain systemic diseases, such as liver and kidney disease, as well as respiratory conditions, can cause nail changes, including discoloration. Yellowing of the nails can be a sign of underlying health issues.
Prevention of Nail Discoloration
:
Keep your nails clean and dry to avoid fungal infections. Trim your nails regularly and avoid biting or picking them, as this can cause trauma and discoloration.
When handling harsh chemicals or materials that can stain or damage nails, always wear gloves. This shields the nails from exposure to potentially hazardous substances.
Choose nail polishes and removers that are free of harsh chemicals such as formaldehyde, toluene, and DBP (dibutyl phthalate) to reduce the risk of discoloration and other nail issues.
Maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and staying hydrated. To promote overall nail health, avoid smoking and drink in moderation.
If you notice significant changes in your nails, such as persistent discoloration or other abnormalities, see a doctor for an accurate diagnosis and treatment. Addressing underlying health issues can help prevent future nail damage.
Understanding Why Nails Turn Yellow
Nail yellowing can occur for a variety of reasons, and understanding these causes can aid in prevention and treatment. Here are a few common causes:
Fungal infections are one of the most common causes of yellow nails. Dermatophytes, moulds, and yeasts can infect nails, causing them to discolour, thicken, and break. Fungal infections thrive in warm, moist environments, making nails vulnerable, especially when damaged or exposed to such conditions.
Smoking tobacco can cause yellowing of the nails. Cigarettes' nicotine and tar can stain nails over time, causing a yellowish discoloration.
Regular use of nail polish, especially darker shades, can stain and yellow the nails. This is usually due to
pigments
and chemicals in the polish penetrating the nail plate.
Harsh chemicals found in nail products such as nail polish removers, acrylic nails, and adhesives can all cause yellowing. These chemicals may weaken the nail structure and cause discoloration over time.
Psoriasis, thyroid disorders, respiratory conditions, and liver diseases can all cause changes in nail colour, including yellowing. These conditions may affect the nail matrix, resulting in abnormal nail growth and discoloration.
As we age, our nails become more brittle and prone to discoloration. This is usually caused by a natural decrease in blood flow to the nail bed, which can make the nails appear yellowish or dull.
Trauma or injury to the nails, such as repeated stress or banging, can cause blood or debris to become trapped beneath the nail, causing discoloration. Subungual hematoma is characterised by a dark purple or blackish hue.
Preventive Measures to Avoid Nail Discoloration
Consider the following preventive measures to avoid nail discoloration:
Practice Good Nail Hygiene
:
Maintain your nails' cleanliness and dryness. Wash them with mild soap and water regularly, then thoroughly dry them. Trim nails straight across and file the edges to avoid snagging or tearing, which can cause discoloration.
Protective Measures
: Wear gloves when working with harsh chemicals or doing anything that could damage or stain your nails. Before applying nail polish, apply a protective base coat to prevent direct contact between your nails and the pigments.
Choose Nail Products Wisely
: Choose nail polishes, removers, and other nail care products that are free of harsh chemicals like formaldehyde, toluene, and dibutyl phthalate (DBP). Consider using water-based or natural nail polishes, which are easier on the nails and less likely to cause discoloration.
Limit Nail Polish Use
: Long-term exposure to pigments can cause staining and discoloration, so avoid leaving nail polish on for too long. Allow your nails to breathe and recover by occasionally removing nail polish.
Maintain Overall Health
: To promote healthy nail growth, follow a well-balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, as dehydration can impair nail health and appearance.  Avoid smoking, as tobacco can stain the nails and contribute to discoloration.
Monitor for Signs of Infection or Disease
: Keep an eye on your nails for any changes in color, texture, or shape, as these could be signs of underlying health issues. Seek medical attention if your nails continue to discolour, thicken, or exhibit other abnormalities.
Proper Nail Care
: Do not use your nails as tools to open or pry objects, as this can cause trauma and discoloration.  To keep your nails and cuticles healthy, moisturise them regularly.
By taking these precautions and practicing good nail care habits, you can reduce the risk of nail discoloration while also maintaining the health and appearance of your nails. If you notice persistent discoloration or other concerning symptoms, you should
consult
a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment.
6 Proven DIY Methods for Nail Whitening
Here are six DIY methods for whitening your nails:
Baking Soda and Lemon Juice Scrub
: Combine baking soda and lemon juice to make a paste. Use a soft toothbrush to gently scrub the paste into your nails. Rinse with warm water, then
moisturise
your nails.
Hydrogen Peroxide Soak:
Dilute hydrogen peroxide with water (1:3). Soak your nails in the solution for a couple of minutes. Rinse thoroughly, then moisturise your nails.
Vinegar Soak:
In a mixing bowl, combine equal parts white vinegar and water. Soak your nails in the mixture for 10–15 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with water and moisturise your nails.
Whitening Toothpaste Scrub:
Use whitening toothpaste on your nails. Scrub your nails lightly with a soft toothbrush. Rinse with warm water, then moisturise your nails.
Coconut Oil and Tea Tree Oil Treatment:
Combine coconut oil with a few drops of tea tree oil. Massage the mixture into your nails and cuticles. Leave it on for 10-15 minutes before rinsing and moisturising.
Sea Salt Soak
: Dissolve the sea salt in warm water. Soak your nails in the solution for 10–15 minutes. Rinse with water and moisturise your nails.
Lemon and Baking Soda Miracle Mix
The lemon and baking soda mixture is a popular DIY solution for a variety of household and beauty applications, including nail whitening. Here's how you can make and use this miracle nail-whitening mix:
Lemon and Baking Soda Nail Whitening Mix
: Ingredients are 1 tablespoon of baking soda and Fresh lemon juice (enough to form a paste). In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of baking soda with enough fresh lemon juice to form a thick paste. Adjust the quantities as needed to achieve the desired consistency. Using a soft toothbrush or nail brush, apply the paste onto your nails, covering them entirely. Gently scrub your nails with the paste, focusing on areas with discoloration or stains. Be gentle to avoid damaging the nails or surrounding skin. Allow the paste to sit on your nails for about 5-10 minutes. This allows the acidic properties of the lemon juice and the abrasive nature of the baking soda to work on removing stains and brightening the nails. After the desired time has passed, rinse off the paste thoroughly with warm water. Ensure that all residue is removed from your nails and surrounding skin. Pat your nails dry with a clean towel. Apply a moisturizing nail oil or hand cream to hydrate your nails and cuticles, as both lemon juice and baking soda can be drying. Depending on the severity of the staining or discoloration, you may need to repeat this process a few times to achieve the desired results. However, avoid overusing this treatment, as frequent exposure to acidic substances like lemon juice can weaken the nails over time.
The Hydrogen Peroxide Solution
Hydrogen peroxide is another common household ingredient used for various purposes, including nail whitening. Here's how you can create and use a hydrogen peroxide solution for whitening your nails:
Hydrogen Peroxide Nail Whitening Solution
: Ingredients are 3% hydrogen peroxide solution and Water. Dilute the hydrogen peroxide solution with an equal amount of water. For example, mix 1 tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide with 1 tablespoon of water to create the solution. Pour the diluted hydrogen peroxide solution into a small bowl or container. Soak your nails in the solution for 2-3 minutes. Ensure that all your nails are fully submerged. Let the solution sit on your nails for the designated time. The hydrogen peroxide works by releasing oxygen, which helps to lift and remove stains from the nails. After soaking, remove your nails from the solution. Rinse your nails thoroughly with water to remove any residual hydrogen peroxide. Pat your nails dry with a clean towel. Apply a moisturizing nail oil or hand cream to hydrate your nails and cuticles, as hydrogen peroxide can be drying. Depending on the severity of the staining or discoloration, you may need to repeat this process a few times to achieve the desired results. However, avoid overusing this treatment, as hydrogen peroxide can weaken the nails if used excessively.
Brightening Effects of Whitening Toothpaste
Whitening toothpaste contains ingredients that help remove surface stains from teeth, and some people use it as a DIY method to brighten their nails. However, it is important to note that whitening toothpaste is designed for dental enamel, which is much harder than the keratin protein found in nails. Here's how whitening toothpaste can affect your nails:
Abrasive Action
: Whitening toothpaste frequently contains mild abrasives like hydrated silica or baking soda, which can help remove surface stains from teeth. When applied to nails, these abrasives may help to remove superficial discoloration, giving them a slightly brighter appearance.
Chemical Bleaching Agents
: Some whitening toothpaste formulations contain hydrogen peroxide or other bleaching agents to help remove tooth stains. When applied to nails, these chemicals may have a mild bleaching effect, reducing yellowing and discoloration.
How to Use Whitening Toothpaste for Nails:
If you decide to use whitening toothpaste on your nails, here's how you can do so safely:
Choose whitening toothpaste that is labelled gentle or for sensitive teeth, as these are less likely to be too abrasive.
To gently scrub your nails, apply a small amount of whitening toothpaste to a soft toothbrush or nail brush. To avoid damaging the nail surface, do not apply excessive pressure.
Avoid using whitening toothpaste on your nails too frequently, as repeated abrasive or chemical exposure can weaken the nails and cause brittleness.
After using whitening toothpaste on your nails, thoroughly rinse them and apply a nourishing oil or cream to help prevent drying.
Apple Cider Vinegar: A Natural Disinfectant
Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is well known for its antimicrobial properties, which make it a popular natural disinfectant for a variety of household and personal care applications. Here is how to use apple cider vinegar as a natural disinfectant:
Cleaning Surfaces
: In a spray bottle, mix equal parts apple cider vinegar and water. Use the solution to clean and disinfect kitchen countertops, cutting boards, bathroom surfaces and other household items.
Foot Soak
:
In a basin or foot bath, combine 1 cup apple cider vinegar and 4 cups warm water. Soak your feet in the solution for 10-15 minutes to help eliminate bacteria and fungi that can cause foot odour and infections.
Hand Sanitizer
: In a small bottle, mix equal parts apple cider vinegar and water. Add a few drops of essential oil (such as tea tree oil) for added antimicrobial benefits and a pleasant scent. When soap and water are unavailable, use the solution to sanitise your hands naturally.
Fruit and Vegetable Wash
:
In a mixing bowl or spray bottle, combine one part apple cider vinegar and three parts water. To remove pesticide residues, dirt, and bacteria from fruits and vegetables, rinse them with the solution.
Surface Disinfectant Spray
: Pour undiluted apple cider vinegar into a spray bottle.  To disinfect and kill germs, spray directly onto high-touch surfaces such as doorknobs and light switches.
Tea Tree Oil: Antifungal and Whitening
Tea tree oil is well-known for its antifungal, antibacterial, and antiseptic properties, making it an effective natural remedy for a variety of skin and nail conditions. Here's how to use tea tree oil for its antifungal and whitening properties:
Antifungal Nail Treatment
:
Tea tree oil should be diluted 1:1 with a carrier oil, such as coconut or olive oil. Apply diluted tea tree oil to the affected nails with a cotton swab or brush. Allow it to completely dry before putting on socks or shoes. Repeat this procedure twice a day until the fungal infection improves.
Nail Whitening Treatment
:
Make a paste by mixing a few drops of tea tree oil, baking soda, and lemon juice. Use a soft toothbrush or a nail brush to gently scrub the mixture into your nails. Rinse with warm water, then moisturise your nails. Repeat this treatment once or twice a week to help whiten and brighten your nails.
Olive Oil and Lemon Soak for Nourishment and Shine
Ingredients are 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, Juice of half a lemon and Warm water (optional). Prepare the Soak by combining the freshly squeezed lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil in a small bowl. To make sure they are combined evenly, thoroughly mix. If you would like, you can preheat the mixture by submerging the bowl in warm water for a short while. This may improve how well the oils are absorbed. Let the lemon and olive oil mixture soak into your nails for ten to fifteen minutes. Make sure the solution is completely submerged under all of your nails. Gently massage the mixture into your cuticles and nails while your nails are soaking. This enables the nutrients to be absorbed fully and aids in circulation. To get rid of any residue left behind after soaking, give your nails a thorough rinse with lukewarm water. Dry them off using a fresh towel. To lock in moisture and further nourish your nails, apply a small amount of extra virgin olive oil or a moisturising hand cream to your cuticles and nails. Depending on your nail care requirements, repeat this olive oil and lemon soak once or twice a week for optimal results. The secret to keeping healthy, glossy nails is consistency.
Maintaining Your Nail Health: Tips and Tricks
A healthy lifestyle, good hygiene, and proper nail care are all necessary to maintain nail health. Here are some tips and tricks for keeping your nails healthy and looking great:
Keep your nails clean and dry
:
Wash your hands often with mild soap and water, then thoroughly dry them.  Use a brush to gently clean dirt and bacteria from under your nails.
Moisturise On A Regular Basis
: Apply moisturiser or nourishing oil to your nails and cuticles every day to keep them hydrated and prevent dryness and brittleness.
Trim and file your nails properly

Drink plenty of water all day to keep your nails and skin hydrated from the inside out.
Limit your exposure to the chemicals found in nail polish, polish removers, and cleaning products, which can weaken and damage your nails.
Avoid using your nails to open or pry objects, as this can result in breakage and damage.
Following this regular care routine and adopting healthy lifestyle habits can help maintain the brightness and strength of your nails, allowing them to look beautiful and vibrant.
The Role of Diet in Nail Health
Diet has a significant impact on nail health because the nutrients you consume directly affect the strength, growth, and appearance of your nails. Here are some important nutrients found in different foods that contribute to nail health:
Protein
: Protein is required for the production of keratin, the protein that forms the structure of nails. Include lean protein sources in your diet, such as chicken, fish, eggs, beans, lentils, tofu, and Greek yoghurt.
Biotin (Vitamin B7)
: Biotin is a B-complex vitamin required for healthy nail growth and strength. Foods high in biotin include eggs, nuts (such as almonds and peanuts), seeds (such as sunflower seeds), whole grains, avocados, and spinach.
Iron
: Low levels of iron can cause brittle nails and sluggish nail development. Include foods high in iron in your diet, such as spinach, lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, lentils, and tofu.
Zinc
: Zinc is necessary to keep the nail bed healthy and to promote nail growth. Oysters, red meat, poultry, beans, nuts, seeds, and whole grains all contain zinc.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
: Omega-3 fatty acids keep the nails moisturised and nourished, increasing flexibility and strength. Include omega-3s in your diet by eating fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, and sardines), flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, and hemp seeds.
Vitamin C
: Vitamin C is required for collagen production, which is critical for nail structural integrity. Include vitamin C-rich foods in your diet, such as citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, grapefruits), strawberries, kiwi, bell peppers, and broccoli.
Vitamin E
: Vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects nails from damage and promotes healthy growth. Almonds, sunflower seeds, spinach, avocado, and vegetable oils are among the foods high in vitamin E.
Water
: Staying hydrated is essential for nail health, as dehydration can cause dry, brittle nails.  Drink plenty of water throughout the day, and eat hydrating foods like watermelon, cucumbers, and oranges.
When to Seek Professional Help for Nail Discoloration
Nail changes, such as discoloration, should always be taken seriously because they may be signs of underlying medical conditions. The following symptoms suggest that it might be time to get professional assistance for discoloured nails:
Persistent Discoloration
: It is best to see a medical professional if your nails have been discoloured for a long time and do not get better with over-the-counter treatments or adjustments to your nail care routine.
Sudden Changes
: If you notice any sudden or significant changes in the colour, texture, or shape of your nails, this could indicate an underlying health condition that necessitates medical attention.
Pain or Discomfort
: Nail discoloration combined with pain, tenderness, swelling, or discharge may indicate an infection or other medical issue that requires immediate attention.
Discoloration Spread
: If the discoloration spreads to other nails or affects a larger portion of the nail bed, it could be the result of a fungal infection or another condition that necessitates medical attention.
Other Symptoms
: Pay attention to any accompanying symptoms, such as itching, burning, or bleeding around the nails, as well as changes in skin colour or texture, as these may provide information about the underlying cause of the nail discoloration.
Risk Factors
: If you have underlying health conditions such as diabetes, psoriasis, or circulation issues, or if you have a weakened immune system, you may be more vulnerable to nail infections and should seek professional advice if your nail health changes.
