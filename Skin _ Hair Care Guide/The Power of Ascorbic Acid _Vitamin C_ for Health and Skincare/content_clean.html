<p><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/benefits-of-vitamin-c-serum">Vitamin C</a>, scientifically known as Ascorbic Acid, is an essential nutrient involved in the repair of tissues and enzymatic production of certain neurotransmitters. It's renowned as a powerhouse antioxidant that shields our body from free radicals, which can lead to chronic diseases if left unchecked.</span></p>
<p><span>Vitamin C is water-soluble and not stored in the body. This characteristic means we must continuously replenish our intake of Vitamin C through diet or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/vitamins-minerals">supplements</a>, as our bodies cannot produce it.</span></p>
<p><span>Although Vitamin C is popularly linked to oranges and citrus fruits, other foods rich in this vitamin include strawberries, kiwi, bell peppers, spinach, kale, and broccoli.</span></p>

<p><span>The benefits of Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) are vast and significant, cutting across many health areas. Some of these benefits are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Boosts Immune System</strong>: Vitamin C enhances our immune defences by supporting various cellular functions of the immune system.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Aids in Collagen Production</strong>: Ascorbic Acid is vital for the production of collagen, a protein that helps wounds heal and maintains the health of bones, teeth, and skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Enhances Iron Absorption</strong>: Vitamin C assists in converting iron that is poorly absorbed, such as plant-based sources of iron, into a form that is easier to absorb.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Antioxidant Function</strong>: It acts as an antioxidant, helping to protect cells from damage caused by free radicals.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Prevents Scurvy</strong>: A severe vitamin C deficiency can cause scurvy, a disease characterised by anaemia, bleeding gums, and weakness. Regular intake of Vitamin C helps to prevent this.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Is Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) good for skin?</strong></h3>
<p><span>Yes, absolutely! Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) plays a significant role in maintaining healthy skin. Here's how:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Promotes Collagen Production:</strong> Collagen is a vital protein that gives your skin its elasticity and strength. Vitamin C aids in collagen synthesis, leading to healthier and firmer skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Fights against Sun Damage:</strong> As an antioxidant, Vitamin C helps to neutralize harmful free radicals produced by excessive sun exposure. It doesn't replace sunscreen but acts as a valuable companion in the fight against UV damage.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Reduces Hyperpigmentation:</strong> Vitamin C can inhibit the enzyme tyrosinase, which helps to prevent melanin production. Less melanin means fewer dark spots and a more even-toned complexion.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Boosts Wound Healing</strong>: Vitamin C helps wounds heal faster by facilitating the production of collagen.</span></p>

</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Apply the Serum:</strong> After cleansing, apply the vitamin C serum evenly across your face. Use your fingers to gently massage the serum into your skin. </span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>

<ol>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Apply Moisturizer:</strong> Once the serum has fully absorbed, apply your regular moisturizer to lock in the serum and hydrate your skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Use Sunscreen:</strong> During the day, always apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen after your skincare routine, as Vitamin C can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Vitamin C Supplements</strong></h3>
<p><span>If you're not getting enough Vitamin C from your diet, supplements are an excellent option. They are available in various forms, such as tablets, capsules, powders, and even gummies. However, before starting any supplement regimen, it's best to consult a healthcare provider to ensure you're taking the right dose.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Vitamin C in Diet</strong></h3>
<p><span>Maintaining a diet rich in Vitamin C is essential for overall health, including skin health. Include plenty of fruits and vegetables, like oranges, kiwi, bell peppers, strawberries, and leafy greens in your diet.</span></p>
