Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder that affects millions of women worldwide. One of the most distressing symptoms of PCOS is hair loss, which can be both emotionally and physically draining. In this blog post, we will explore the causes of PCOS-related hair loss, symptoms of PCOS-related hair loss, and the different treatment options and home remedies to reduce hair fall caused by PCOS.
Causes of PCOS-related hair loss
PCOS is a complex condition that affects the balance of hormones in the body, which can lead to a variety of symptoms, including hair loss. The main cause of hair loss in women with PCOS is an excess of androgens, which are male hormones that are present in both men and women. High levels of androgens can cause the hair on the scalp to become thin and fall out, leading to hair loss.
Hair loss in women with PCOS is caused by an excess of androgens, which can lead to hair thinning and hair loss. Other factors such as inflammation, insulin resistance, and genetics can also contribute to hair loss. Other factors that can contribute to PCOS-related hair loss include:
Anovulation (lack of ovulation)
Inflammation
Insulin resistance
Genetics
It's important to remember that not everyone with PCOS experiences hair loss, and that each afflicted person may suffer hair loss differently and to varying degrees. In addition, treating the underlying hormonal imbalances and other PCOS-related contributing factors might help control and ameliorate the symptoms of hair loss. Getting advice from medical specialists that specialise in hair issues, such as dermatologists or endocrinologists, can help identify and treat PCOS-related hair loss.
Hormonal imbalances and hair loss
Hormonal imbalances can have a significant impact on hair health and contribute to a variety of hair loss symptoms. Several hormonal factors can affect hair growth cycles, resulting in conditions like:
Androgenetic Alopecia (Pattern Baldness)
: This type of hair loss is frequently linked to genetics and hormonal factors, specifically dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a testosterone derivative. DHT can cause hair follicles to shrink, resulting in shorter and finer
hair growth
and, eventually, hair loss.
Telogen Effluvium
: Hormonal fluctuations, such as those that occur during menopause, after childbirth, or as a result of thyroid disorders, can result in telogen effluvium. This condition causes more hair follicles to enter a resting phase, resulting in increased shedding or thinning of the hair.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
: PCOS is a female hormonal disorder characterised by elevated levels of androgens (male hormones) such as testosterone. Due to elevated androgen levels, one of its symptoms may be male-pattern baldness or thinning hair.
Thyroid Conditions
: Hair loss can result from both hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) and hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid). Hair follicle cycling is greatly influenced by thyroid hormones, and abnormalities in this hormone can cause hair shedding by upsetting the hair growth cycle.
Alopecia Areata
: This autoimmune disorder causes patches of hair loss and is believed to be linked to hormonal changes in the body that impact the immune system's reaction.
To address hormonal imbalances and hair loss, different strategies are frequently used:
Medication
: Medication such as hormone replacements, anti-androgens, or thyroid hormone regulators may be prescribed, depending on the particular hormonal condition that has been diagnosed.
Lifestyle Modifications
: Hormonal balance and hair health can be positively impacted by eating a better diet, controlling stress, exercising frequently, and leading a healthy lifestyle.
Topical Treatments
: Topical solutions or treatments containing active ingredients such as minoxidil, Procapil, or Redensyl may help stimulate hair growth and counteract the effects of hormonal imbalances.
Talk to Experts
: To find the best course of action and understand the underlying hormonal cause of hair loss, it is essential to speak with an endocrinologist, dermatologist, or other qualified healthcare provider.
When treating hormonal imbalance-related hair loss, a comprehensive strategy that takes into account the patient's medical history and individual factors as well as the imbalance's underlying cause is frequently necessary. For a correct diagnosis and course of treatment, consulting a professional is therefore imperative.
The role of insulin resistance in hair loss
The disorder known as insulin resistance occurs when the body's cells lose their sensitivity to the hormone insulin, which aids in controlling blood sugar levels. This may result in increased blood levels of insulin, which could have several negative effects on the body, including possible harm to the health of the hair. There are certain connections and theories regarding the relationship between hair loss and insulin resistance, even though the exact relationship is not fully understood.
It has been proposed that insulin resistance influences androgenetic alopecia, or pattern hair loss. Higher insulin levels may cause an increase in androgen production and a hormonal imbalance, including testosterone and DHT, both of which have been linked to hair follicle miniaturisation in AGA.
Insulin resistance can contribute to increased inflammation in the body, and inflammation can affect the health of the scalp and potentially impact hair growth cycles. Conditions such as seborrhoeic dermatitis and psoriasis, which can affect the scalp, may be exacerbated by insulin resistance and thus affect hair health indirectly.
Insulin resistance and the associated metabolic imbalances may cause stress on the body, potentially contributing to conditions such as telogen effluvium. This type of hair shedding is known to be triggered by stress and hormonal imbalances.
Insulin resistance can result in higher levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which can influence other hormonal pathways related to hair growth and loss.
Managing insulin resistance through dietary changes and, if necessary, medical intervention may improve hair health indirectly:
Adopting a balanced diet low in processed sugars and refined carbohydrates, as well as increasing your intake of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats, can aid in the management of insulin resistance.
Physical activity improves insulin sensitivity and can help manage insulin resistance.
Medication or medical intervention may be required in some cases to manage insulin resistance. Consultation with a healthcare professional or endocrinologist is essential for proper diagnosis and management.
While research into the relationship between insulin resistance and hair loss is ongoing, addressing insulin resistance through lifestyle changes and seeking medical advice for appropriate treatment can potentially improve overall health, which may influence hair health.

Diet and lifestyle changes for PCOS hair loss
PCOS is a hormonal disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms, including hair loss or thinning due to hormonal imbalances, particularly higher levels of androgens (male hormones) like testosterone. Lifestyle and dietary changes can help to manage PCOS-related hair loss. Here are some suggestions:
Balanced Diet
: Focus on a well-balanced diet rich in whole foods, vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Choose complex carbohydrates over refined sugars and processed foods to help manage blood sugar levels. Avoid sugary foods and beverages.
Low Glycemic Index (GI) Foods
: Foods with a low glycemic index can help control insulin levels. They include non-starchy vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains.
Healthy Fats
: Include omega-3 fatty acids from fish, flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts in your diet. These fats may help with inflammation reduction and hormonal balance improvement.
Regular Exercise
: Physical activity and regular exercise can improve insulin sensitivity and help manage weight, which can positively impact hormonal balance in PCOS.
Stress Management
: Practice stress-relief techniques like yoga, meditation, deep breathing exercises, or hobbies that promote relaxation, as stress can exacerbate hormonal imbalances.
Limit Caffeine and Alcohol
: Reduce the intake of caffeine and alcohol, as they can potentially worsen hormonal imbalances in some individuals.
Adequate Hydration
: Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, which is beneficial for overall health and can support healthy hair growth.
Supplements and Vitamins
: Consult a healthcare professional about supplements such as omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and certain B vitamins that might be beneficial for hair health in PCOS. However, it's essential to get professional guidance regarding supplementation.
Consultation with Specialists
: Consider consulting with a healthcare professional specializing in PCOS, such as an endocrinologist or a gynecologist, for personalized guidance and treatment options specific to your condition.
It may take time to manage PCOS-related hair loss through dietary and lifestyle changes, and individual responses may vary. Professional assistance is essential in developing a comprehensive plan that addresses both the hormonal aspects of PCOS and the associated hair loss concerns.
Hair care routines for PCOS sufferers
Hair care routines for people with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) can help with symptoms like hair thinning, excessive shedding, and scalp problems. Here are some ideas for a good hair care routine:
Gentle Cleansing
: Use a gentle shampoo that is appropriate for your hair type and scalp condition. Washing too frequently can strip the scalp of natural oils, exacerbating dryness.
Scalp Care
: To improve circulation, gently massage the scalp while shampooing to keep it clean and healthy. Consider using scalp-friendly products or treatments to address specific scalp issues like dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis.
Conditioning
: Use a conditioner that is appropriate for your hair type to keep it hydrated and manageable. Apply it to the lengths and ends of your hair, avoiding the scalp if you have an oily scalp.
Avoid Heat Styling
: Avoid using heat styling tools like straighteners, curling irons, and blow dryers, as they can cause hair damage. If you are going to use heat styling, use a heat protectant first.
Avoid Tight Hairstyles
: Hairstyles that pull on the hair, such as tight ponytails or braids, can cause additional stress on the hair follicles and lead to breakage.
Nutritious Diet
: Maintain a healthy diet that is rich in essential nutrients such as proteins, vitamins, and minerals. Consider foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, biotin, and antioxidants, all of which are beneficial to hair health.
Regular Exercise
: Regular physical activity can help you lose weight and improve your overall health, which can help with hormonal balance and hair health.
Stress Management
: Reduce stress by engaging in stress-relieving activities such as meditation, yoga, or hobbies. Chronic stress can exacerbate PCOS-related hormonal imbalances and negatively impact hair health.
Hair Treatments or Supplements
: Consult a healthcare professional or a dermatologist for advice on hair treatments or supplements that may aid in the management of hair thinning or the promotion of hair growth. These might include topical treatments or oral supplements rich in vitamins, minerals, or hair growth-promoting ingredients.
Consultation with Specialists
: Consider seeking advice from PCOS specialists or dermatologists for personalised advice and treatment options specific to your PCOS-related hair concerns.
Remember that while these tips can help with hair-related PCOS symptoms, individual responses may vary. It is critical for effective management to seek personalised advice and treatment options from healthcare professionals that are tailored to your specific needs and condition.
Treat your PCOS-related hair loss with care
It is important to note that hair loss can be caused by a variety of factors and a proper diagnosis is necessary to determine the cause and best course of treatment. If you suspect that you may be experiencing hair loss due to PCOS, it is important to consult with a doctor or trichologist to determine the best course of treatment. With the right treatment plan and a commitment to maintaining a healthy lifestyle, it is possible to regrow hair and reduce symptoms.
Symptoms of PCOS-related hair loss
The pattern of hair loss in women with PCOS is typically diffuse, meaning that hair is lost all over the scalp rather than in specific areas. Symptoms of PCOS hair loss include hair thinning, hair loss, and diffuse hair loss all over the scalp. The following are some of the most common symptoms of PCOS-related hair loss:
Thinning Hair
: Gradual thinning of hair, particularly on the crown or top of the scalp, is a common symptom. Hair may become noticeably thinner or less dense over time.
Increased Hair Shedding
: Excessive hair shedding or finding more hair on pillows, in the shower, or on hairbrushes can be signs of PCOS-related hair loss. This may result in a reduction in overall hair volume.
Bald Patches or Receding Hairline
: Individuals may notice bald patches or a receding hairline in some cases, particularly in patterns resembling androgenetic alopecia, which is common in PCOS-related hair loss.
Hair Texture Changes
: Hair may become finer, more brittle, or weaker. The texture of the hair may change, appearing less healthy or losing volume.
Scalp Issues
: Some people with PCOS-related hair loss may experience scalp issues such as dryness, itchiness, or dandruff, which can contribute to or worsen the condition.
Hormonal Acne
: In addition to hair loss, PCOS is frequently associated with hormonal acne, which can appear on the face, chest, or back as a result of increased androgen levels.
Excessive Body Hair (Hirsutism)
: Excessive hair growth on areas such as the face, chest, or back (hirsutism) is another common symptom of PCOS due to elevated androgen levels.
A shampoo specifically formulated for hair loss caused by PCOS may contain ingredients that can help improve the health of the scalp and hair, but it may not necessarily regrow hair on its own. It is best to take a dermatologist consultation online to determine the best course of treatment for your specific case of hair loss.
Medical treatment for PCOS-related hair loss
Managing the underlying hormonal imbalances and addressing the particular factors contributing to hair thinning or shedding are usually part of treating PCOS-related hair loss. Medical interventions for hair loss associated with PCOS may involve:
Birth control pills
: Birth control pills can help regulate hormones and reduce the levels of androgens in the body.
Spironolactone
: Spironolactone is a medication that blocks the effects of androgens and can be used to treat hair loss in women with PCOS.
Metformin
: Metformin is a medication used to treat diabetes, but it has also been found to be effective in reducing hair loss in women with PCOS.
Depending on the severity of hair loss, particular symptoms, and other characteristics unique to each patient's condition, different treatment modalities may be used. To find the best treatment strategy for your needs, it's imperative to speak with a medical expert, such as a dermatologist with experience treating hair loss or an endocrinologist with specialisation in PCOS. Effectively treating the underlying hormonal abnormalities linked to PCOS is essential for managing hair loss.
Home remedies for PCOS-related hair loss
Some natural remedies that may help reduce hair loss in women with PCOS include:
Eating a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals
Taking
saw palmetto
and green tea supplements
Taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements
Reducing stress through meditation or yoga
Regularly massaging the scalp to improve blood flow
The following natural ingredients can help you treat PCOS-related hair loss naturally:
Saw palmetto
: Saw palmetto is an herb that is effective in reducing
hair loss in women
with PCOS.
Green tea
: Green tea is high in antioxidants and is effective in reducing hair loss in women with PCOS.
Omega-3 fatty acids
: Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for maintaining healthy hair and skin, and can help reduce hair loss in women with PCOS.
Keep in mind that while these natural therapies may have some advantages, everyone's reaction is different. A healthcare provider should be consulted to receive an accurate diagnosis and advice for treatment relevant to your condition. To properly manage hair loss associated with PCOS, also think of these solutions as supplements to medically prescribed medications and lifestyle modifications.
Psychological impact of hair loss in PCOS
Hair loss, which is a common symptom of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), can have a significant psychological impact on those who suffer from it. The emotional and psychological effects of PCOS-related hair loss can be distressing, and may include:
Lowered Self-Esteem
: Hair loss can have an impact on one's self-image and self-confidence, leading to feelings of self-consciousness and lowered self-esteem. Individuals may feel less attractive or feminine/masculine as their appearance changes.
Anxiety
: Hair loss can cause anxiety, especially in social situations or when confronted with the prospect of being judged based on appearance. Anxiety can be caused by a fear of being perceived differently or negatively by others.
Depression
: Hair loss caused by PCOS can exacerbate feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and depression. It can affect one's daily life, relationships, and overall emotional well-being.
Social Withdrawal
: Some people may withdraw from social activities to avoid situations where their hair loss may be noticed or commented on. This social withdrawal may cause them to become even more isolated from their social circles.
Impact on Relationships
: Hair loss can have an impact on relationships, particularly intimate relationships, because individuals may feel less confident or comfortable with their appearance, causing strains in relationships.
Negative Body Image
: Changes in physical appearance due to hair loss may contribute to a negative body image, leading to dissatisfaction with one's overall appearance.
Impact on Work or Academic Life
: Hair loss-related stress may interfere with concentration, productivity, or performance at work or in school.
Managing the psychological impact of PCOS-related hair loss is critical and may require a variety of approaches:
Talking to friends, family, or a mental health professional can help you cope with the emotional impact of hair loss.
Joining support groups or online communities where people share similar experiences can provide a sense of belonging and understanding.
Professional therapy or counselling sessions can assist in addressing the emotional impact of hair loss, providing coping strategies, and improving self-esteem.
Relaxation and self-care activities, such as exercise, hobbies, meditation, or mindfulness, can help reduce stress levels.
Investigating treatment options for PCOS-related hair loss, such as topical treatments, supplements, or medical interventions prescribed by healthcare professionals, can help manage hair-related distress.
To address the psychological impact of hair loss in PCOS, a comprehensive approach that takes into account both the physical and emotional aspects of the condition is required. Seeking professional assistance and developing a strong support network can greatly assist individuals in coping with the emotional challenges associated with hair loss.
