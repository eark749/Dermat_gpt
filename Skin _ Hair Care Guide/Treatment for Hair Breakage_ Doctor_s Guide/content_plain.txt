Hair breakage is a common issue that many people face, and it can be frustrating to deal with. Hair breakage occurs when the hair shaft breaks, which can lead to split ends,
frizz
, and hair that is difficult to manage. If you're experiencing hair breakage read on to get a comprehensive overview of hair breakage, including the causes, signs, and treatment options.
Hair Breakage Causes
There are a variety of factors that can contribute to hair breakage. Understanding these causes can help you take preventative measures to protect your hair from further damage. Here are some common causes of
hair breakage
:
Environmental factors
- Excessive exposure to the sun, wind, and other environmental factors can weaken hair strands and cause breakage.
Chemical treatments
- Hair treatments such as coloring, relaxing, and perming can weaken the hair shaft, making it more susceptible to breakage.
Heat styling
- Frequent use of hot styling tools such as blow dryers, flat irons, and curling irons can cause hair to become dry and brittle, leading to breakage.
Over-manipulation
- Too much brushing, combing, or pulling on the hair can cause breakage, especially when the hair is wet.
Poor nutrition
- A diet lacking essential nutrients such as protein,
iron
, and vitamins can weaken hair and cause it to break.
By understanding the causes of hair breakage, you can take steps to prevent it from occurring and protect your hair from further damage.
Environmental Factors
Environmental variables significantly influence the health and look of our hair. Various external factors in our environment can affect the state of our hair, causing problems such as dryness, breakage, and dullness. Understanding these environmental factors might help you implement proper hair care habits to reduce damage. Here are some important environmental elements that can influence hair health:
Overexposure to the sun's UV rays can make hair dry, brittle, and prone to breakage. UV radiation can also cause damage to the hair cuticle, resulting in moisture loss and color fade. Wear a hat or scarf to protect your hair from direct sunlight. To reduce sun damage, use UV-protective hair care products.
High humidity levels can make hair frizzy and unruly, particularly for people with curly or wavy hair. Excess moisture in the air can also cause hair to tangle and break. To control frizz, apply anti-frizz serums or leave-in conditioners. Consider hairstyles that are less susceptible to humidity, such as updos or braids.
Dry air, especially in winter or arid locations, can cause moisture loss from the hair, resulting in dryness, static, and greater susceptibility to breaking. Use hydrating hair masks, oils, or leave-in conditioners to combat dryness and keep moisture levels in your hair. Consider using a humidifier to add moisture to indoor air.
Air pollution, which includes particulate matter, smoke, and chemicals, can accumulate on the hair and scalp, causing buildup, dullness, and probable scalp discomfort. To remove toxins and impurities from your hair, wash it daily with a gentle shampoo. Consider using clarifying shampoos on occasion to deep clean your hair and scalp.
Swimming pool chlorine and ocean seawater can deplete hair's natural oils, resulting in dryness, brittleness, and color fading. Rinse your hair with fresh water before swimming to reduce chlorine and saltwater absorption. Wear swim caps or apply protective leave-in conditioners.
Strong winds can tangle hair and cause mechanical damage, but harsh weather conditions such as rain or snow can make it moist and prone to breaking. In windy weather, wear protective hairstyles like braids or buns. During stormy weather, use umbrellas or hats to protect your hair from wetness.
Rapid temperature fluctuations, such as transitioning from hot to cold conditions, can stress the hair cuticle, causing moisture loss and brittleness. To reduce damage caused by temperature variations, apply thermal protectant sprays before heat styling.
Chemical Treatments
Chemical treatments for hair might include coloring, perming, relaxing, and straightening. While these procedures can dramatically improve the appearance of your hair, they also include dangers and considerations. Here's an overview of typical chemical hair treatments, their effects, and how to care for chemically treated hair:
Hair Coloring
:
There are four types of hair dye: permanent, semi-permanent, demi-permanent, and temporary. Deposits pigments to change the color of the hair. Permanent dyes raise the cuticle and deposit color molecules within the cortex. To keep your hair looking vibrant, use color-safe shampoos and conditioners. To avoid color fading, use as little heat as possible when styling.
Hair Relaxing
: Straightens curly or wavy hair by dissolving protein linkages. Chemicals Used Typically contain strong alkalis, such as sodium hydroxide or guanidine hydroxide. Effects include a permanent alteration in hair texture till new growth begins. To avoid dryness and breakage, use moisturizing products that are free of sulfates. To prevent further damage, limit the use of heat styling.
Hair Perming
:
Restructures the hair connections to provide straight hair curls or waves. Cysteamine hydrochloride or ammonium thioglycolate. Permanent change in hair texture till new growth begins. To retain elasticity and avoid dryness, moisturize regularly using deep conditioning treatments.
Keratin Treatments
:
Use a keratin-based solution to smooth frizzy hair and decrease curl. Formaldehyde or formaldehyde-releasing chemicals. Effects are semi-permanent, lasting many weeks to months. Use sulfate-free, keratin-safe products to extend the treatment's effectiveness. Avoid overwashing.
Bleaching
:
Removes natural pigment from the hair to lighten its color. The chemicals used are hydrogen peroxide or ammonia. It damages the hair cuticle, which can lead to dryness and breakage. To avoid additional damage, deep condition regularly and avoid using excessive heat when styling.
If you have extensive hair damage, breakage, or scalp irritation following a chemical treatment, see a competent stylist or dermatologist. They can examine your hair's condition and recommend treatments or products to help it recover. Chemical therapies can be revolutionary, but they require careful maintenance and risk assessment. To maintain the health and vibrancy of your chemically treated hair, prioritize delicate care and feeding.
Signs of Hair Breakage
Hair breakage can be difficult to spot at first, but some tell-tale signs can help you identify it. Here are some common signs of hair breakage:
Split ends
-
Split ends
occur when the hair shaft splits at the end and are a clear indication of hair breakage.
Short hair strands
- If you've noticed that your hair is not growing as it used to, it could be a sign of hair breakage.
Hair tangles easily
- Hair that is prone to tangling, even when it's well-moisturized, could be a sign of breakage.
Hair feels rough and dry
- If your hair feels rough or dry to the touch, it could be a sign that it's damaged and breaking.
Excessive shedding
- While some shedding is normal, excessive shedding could be a sign of hair breakage.
If you've noticed any of these signs, it's important to take action to prevent further damage to your hair.
Split Ends
Split ends are a common hair problem, but there are efficient ways to manage and avoid them. Split ends develop when the hair's protective outer covering (the cuticle) wears away, allowing the inner layers of the hair strand to separate and split. Here's a guide on how to handle split ends:
Trimming is the most effective approach to removing split ends. Schedule regular haircuts (every 6-8 weeks) to remove split ends and keep them from moving up the hair shaft.
Washing hair too regularly can deplete natural oils, causing dryness and breakage. Aim to wash your hair 2-3 times per week. Choose a sulfate-free, moisturizing shampoo that is gentle on your hair and scalp. Use a conditioner after each wash to keep your hair nourished and prevent the possibility of split ends.
Limit the use of heated tools including flat irons, curling irons, and blow dryers. To minimize damage from heat styling tools, use a heat protectant spray.
Detangle hair gently using a wide-tooth comb, especially when it's wet and more prone to breakage.
Start brushing from the ends and work your way up to prevent pulling and breakage.
Avoid hairstyles that pull on the hair, such as tight ponytails, braids, or buns. Opt for looser styles to reduce stress on the hair shaft.
Incorporate deep conditioning treatments or masks into your hair care routine to moisturize and nourish the hair, reducing the risk of split ends.
Consume a diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and proteins to promote healthy hair growth. Drink plenty of water to keep your hair and scalp hydrated.
Sleep on silk or satin pillowcases to reduce friction and minimize damage to the hair while sleeping.
Minimize the use of harsh chemical treatments such as bleaching, coloring, or perming, which can weaken the hair and contribute to split ends.
Apply coconut oil to the ends of your hair to hydrate and seal the cuticle, reducing the appearance of split ends.
Mash a ripe avocado and apply it as a mask to nourish and moisturize dry, damaged hair.
Thinning Hair
Dealing with thinning hair can be upsetting, but there are several ways to manage and handle the problem. Genetics, hormonal changes, medical issues, and lifestyle decisions are all potential causes of thinning hair. Here's a thorough guide to managing thinning hair:
If you have considerable hair thinning, see a dermatologist to establish the underlying cause. They can run tests to see whether any medical issues are causing hair loss.
To reduce breakage, treat your hair with delicate care. Avoid rough brushing, tight hairstyles, and harsh chemical treatments. Choose gentle shampoos and conditioners designed for thinning hair. Avoid products containing sulfates or harsh chemicals, which can further harm delicate hair.
Use volumizing mousses, sprays, or serums to give thinning hair volume and texture. Limit the use of heated styling appliances (e.g., blow dryers, straighteners) because they might weaken hair. When necessary, apply heat-protectant sprays.
Massage your scalp regularly to improve blood circulation and hair development. Some treatments, such as scalp serums or low-level laser therapy (LLLT), can assist in enhancing scalp health and promote hair development.
To promote healthy hair growth, ensure that your diet contains protein, iron, vitamins (particularly B vitamins), and important fatty acids. Drink plenty of water to keep your scalp and hair moisturized.
Chronic stress can contribute to hair thinning. Practice stress-reducing activities such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises. Smoking can negatively impact hair growth and overall hair health.
Consult with a healthcare professional about taking supplements like biotin, zinc, or iron if you have deficiencies that may be contributing to hair thinning.
Over-the-counter or prescription topical treatments containing minoxidil can help stimulate hair growth. Finasteride (for men) and spironolactone (for women) are prescription medications that may be prescribed to address hair loss.
If other treatments haven't been effective, consider consulting a specialist about hair transplant or restoration options.

Choosing the Right Coconut Oil

Choose virgin or extra-virgin coconut oil, which is unprocessed and contains no additions or synthetic chemicals. This form of coconut oil contains more nutrients and useful characteristics.
How to Apply Coconut Oil Treatment
:
Start with dry or slightly damp hair. Scoop out a small amount of coconut oil (the amount will depend on your hair length and thickness). Rub the coconut oil between your palms to warm it up and melt it into a liquid if it's solidified. Gently massage the coconut oil into your scalp using your fingertips. Focus on the roots and then distribute the oil evenly through the lengths of your hair, concentrating on the ends.
Leave-In Time
:
For an intensive treatment, leave the coconut oil on your hair overnight. Cover your hair with a shower cap or towel to avoid staining your pillow. If you prefer a shorter treatment, leave the coconut oil on for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour before washing it out.
Washing Out

Coconut oil penetrates the hair shaft and helps moisturize from within, reducing dryness and frizz. The fatty acids in coconut oil can help strengthen hair and reduce breakage. Regular use of coconut oil can improve hair's natural shine and luster. Massaging coconut oil into the scalp can promote circulation and support overall scalp health.

You can use coconut oil as a hair treatment once a week or as needed based on your hair's condition. Experiment with the frequency of coconut oil treatments to find what works best for your hair type and concerns.
Avocado Hair Mask
An avocado hair mask is an excellent natural treatment for deeply nourishing and moisturising your hair, making it smooth, lustrous, and manageable. Avocado contains vital fatty acids, vitamins (including vitamin E and B vitamins), and minerals that help strengthen hair, repair damage, and encourage healthy development. Here's how to create and apply an avocado hair mask effectively:
Ingredients
: 1 ripe avocado (or more depending on hair length), 1-2 tablespoons of coconut oil or olive oil (for added moisture), 1 tablespoon of honey (optional, for extra hydration), and a few drops of essential oil such as lavender or rosemary.
Instructions
: Cut the ripe avocado in half, remove the pit, and scoop out the flesh into a bowl. Use a fork to mash the avocado until it becomes smooth and creamy. Ensure no large chunks are remaining. Add 1-2 tablespoons of coconut oil or olive oil to the mashed avocado. The oil helps to enhance the moisturizing properties of the mask. Optionally, add 1 tablespoon of honey to the mixture for extra hydration and to boost shine. If desired, add a few drops of your preferred essential oil for a pleasant fragrance and added benefits. Thoroughly mix all the ingredients together until you achieve a smooth, uniform consistency. Start with dry or slightly damp hair. Section your hair and apply the avocado mask from roots to ends, ensuring all strands are coated evenly. Massage the mask into your scalp to promote circulation and nourish the hair follicles. Once applied, cover your hair with a shower cap or wrap it in a warm towel to enhance absorption. Leave the avocado mask on for about 30 minutes to 1 hour to allow the nutrients to penetrate the hair shaft. After the desired time, rinse out the mask thoroughly using lukewarm water. Follow up with a gentle shampoo to remove any remaining residue. You may not need to use conditioner afterward, as the mask itself is deeply conditioned. Allow your hair to air dry or style it as usual. Notice the softness, shine, and manageability of your hair after using the avocado mask.
