Dark Circles: Witch Hazel's Secret Weapon to Reducing Puffiness
Witch hazel can help reduce puffiness around the eyes, which can reduce the appearance of dark circles. The skin can be tightened and soothed by witch hazel's astringent properties, and swelling and puffiness can be lessened by the herb's anti-inflammatory properties.

Place cotton pads that have been dipped in witch hazel over your closed eyes for ten to fifteen minutes. Inflammation and puffiness may be lessened as a result.

While witch hazel is generally thought to be safe, it can still cause irritation or allergic reactions in some people. Always perform a patch test on a small area of skin before applying it to a larger area, and discontinue use if any adverse reactions occur.
