<h2><b>The Importance of pH Balance When Using Witch Hazel</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="witch hazel for skin" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/How_to_Use_Rosehip_Oil_for_Skin_f0c9bbd4-e46d-4564-a0ac-dc0435315877_480x480.png?v=1680348140"/></b></p>
<p><span>Maintaining your skin's pH balance is critical for healthy skin. The natural pH of the skin is around 5.5, which is slightly acidic and protects the skin from harmful bacteria and environmental stressors. When incorporating witch hazel into your skincare routine, keep its pH in mind. Witch hazel has a pH level of around 5, which is slightly acidic and similar to the pH level of the skin. This means that using witch hazel can aid in the maintenance of the skin's natural pH balance and the maintenance of healthy skin. It is important to note, however, that not all witch hazel products are created equal. The additional ingredients in some products, like alcohol, may disrupt the pH balance of the skin and result in dryness or irritation. When selecting a witch hazel product, look for one that does not contain alcohol or other harsh ingredients.</span></p>
