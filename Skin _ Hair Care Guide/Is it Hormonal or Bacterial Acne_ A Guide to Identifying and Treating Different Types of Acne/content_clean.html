<p><span>People of all ages frequently experience acne, which can have a number of different causes. The best treatment strategy will depend on the type of acne you have, so this is crucial. The two most prevalent types of acne are bacterial and hormonal acne. Hormonal acne, which is frequently found in teenagers, women during their menstrual cycles, and people with hormonal imbalances like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), is brought on by changes in the body's hormone levels. On the cheeks, chin, and jawline, hormonal acne is frequently characterized by deep, agonizing cysts. Oral contraceptives, spironolactone, topical retinoids, and antibiotics can all be used to treat hormonal pain.  Contrarily, bacterial acne is brought on by an overabundance of bacteria on the skin and is frequently distinguished by whiteheads, blackheads, and tiny pimples that appear on the forehead, nose, and chin. Topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics, and isotretinoin are some treatments for bacterial acne that are available.</span></p>
<p><span>The ideal treatment strategy for your particular type of acne should be determined in collaboration with a healthcare professional or dermatologist. Topical and oral medications, as well as lifestyle changes like stress reduction and a healthy diet, may all be part of a comprehensive treatment plan. It is possible to improve skin health and stop further outbreaks of acne by locating and treating the underlying causes of the condition.</span></p>
<h2><b>Understanding Hormonal and Bacterial Acne</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Identifying and Treating Different Types of Acne" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Vaishnavi_Blog_Image_-_4_6ba6384a-5de6-4d81-895c-b90e445111bb_480x480.jpg?v=1680604777"/></div>
<p><span>Both hormonal and bacterial acne are different types of acne with unique causes and treatment modalities.</span></p>
<p><span>A hormonal imbalance, particularly an increase in androgens, which prompts the sebaceous glands to produce more oil, is the root cause of hormonal acne. This surplus oil has the potential to clog pores and foster the growth of bacteria that cause acne. Teenagers and women are most likely to develop hormonal acne, especially during pregnancy, menstruation, and menopause. Depending on how severe the condition is, hormonal acne can be treated with birth control pills, spironolactone, or isotretinoin.</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, Propionibacterium acnes in particular overgrows on the skin and leads to bacterial acne. The red, inflamed pimples associated with this type of acne may contain pus. People with oily skin or those who neglect to keep their skin clean are more likely to experience bacterial acne. Salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and topical or oral antibiotics are all possible treatments for bacterial acne. It is possible for someone to have both hormonal acne and bacterial acne, in which case treatment may combine methods to address both etiologies. A dermatologist should be consulted for a precise diagnosis and a customized treatment strategy.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Role of Hormones and Sebum in Hormonal Acne</b></h3>
<p><span>The imbalance of hormones, particularly the rise in androgens, is the root cause of hormonal acne. Male sex hormones known as androgens are present in both men and women, though men tend to have higher levels of them. Both the adrenal glands and the ovaries produce androgens in females. When the sebaceous glands, which are tiny oil-producing glands in the skin, are overstimulated by an excess of androgens, the body produces more sebum than the skin needs. Excess sebum can clog pores and create an ideal environment for bacteria growth, which can lead to acne.</span></p>
<p><span>Androgens also promote skin cell growth, which can result in the formation of keratin plugs that obstruct pores and result in comedones or blackheads. Hormonal acne is more prevalent in teenagers and women due to hormonal changes associated with puberty, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause, which can all raise androgen levels. The goal of hormonal acne treatment is to lower androgen levels and lower sebum production.  Hormonal remedies can help with hormonal acne by lowering androgen levels, including birth control pills and spironolactone. Severe hormonal acne can also be successfully treated with the help of the drug isotretinoin, which reduces sebum production.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Role of Bacteria and Inflammation in Bacterial Acne</b></h3>
<p><span>The overgrowth of bacteria on the skin, especially Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), is the primary cause of bacterial acne, also referred to as inflammatory acne. P. acnes is a naturally occurring bacterium that inhabits the skin, but when it grows excessively, it can cause an inflammatory reaction that results in the development of cysts and pimples. P. acnes can spread and inflame the hair follicle, resulting in lesions that are red, swollen, and filled with pus. Inflammation has the potential to scar or hyperpigment the nearby skin.</span></p>
<p><span>When P. acnes is present, the immune system reacts by directing white blood cells to the infection site to combat the bacteria. This immune response results in inflammation, which may make acne worse.</span></p>
<p><span>People with oily skin or those who neglect skin care are more likely to experience bacterial acne because these conditions promote the growth of bacteria on the skin due to excess oil and debris. Bacterial acne can also develop as a result of other elements like hormonal imbalances, stress, and a poor diet. Treatment for bacterial acne aims to decrease the growth of P. acnes and reduce inflammation. Topical and oral antibiotics, such as clindamycin and tetracycline, are effective in killing bacteria and reducing inflammation. Benzoyl peroxide, which has both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, can also be used to <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/how-to-cure-pimples-at-home">treat bacterial acne</a>. In addition, salicylic acid can help to unclog pores and prevent the formation of new acne lesions.</span></p>

<h2><b>Identifying Hormonal and Bacterial Acne</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="Identifying and Treating Different Types of Acne" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Vaishnavi_Blog_Image_-_5_0875857d-f478-4976-9239-c1bd008cd819_480x480.jpg?v=1680604968"/></b></p>
<p><span>The presence of pimples, blackheads, whiteheads, and cysts on the face, neck, chest, and back are common symptoms of both hormonal acne and bacterial acne. The difference between hormonal and bacterial acne can be determined, though, by a few other characteristics. Women are more likely to develop hormonal acne on the lower face and jawline, and these areas are more likely to be affected during particular menstrual cycle phases, such as just before menstruation or during ovulation. Other signs of hormonal imbalances like irregular periods, excessive hair growth, or hair loss may also be present in addition to this one. On the other hand, bacterial acne is characterized by the presence of red, tender, and frequently inflamed cysts, pustules, and pimples. The forehead, nose, and chin are examples of oily skin areas where it is more likely to appear.</span></p>
<p><span>A dermatologist can examine the skin, and consider the patient's medical history and other symptoms to determine whether the acne is hormonal or bacterial. In order to identify the underlying cause of the acne, they may also carry out tests, such as hormone level tests or skin swabs.  </span></p>
<h3><b>Types of Acne: Pimples, Blackheads, and Whiteheads</b></h3>
<p><span>Acne that frequently affects the skin includes pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Pimples</b><span>: Pimples, also known as papules, are small red or pink bumps that form on the skin. They are often inflamed and may contain pus. Pimples occur when hair follicles become clogged with oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria. Factors such as hormonal imbalances, stress, and a poor diet can contribute to the development of pimples.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Blackheads</b><span>: Blackheads, also known as open comedones, are small, dark spots that appear on the skin. They are formed when the hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells, but unlike pimples, the pore remains open, which allows the trapped oil and dead skin cells to oxidize and turn black. Blackheads are more common in people with oily skin and can be exacerbated by factors such as humidity and sweating.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Whiteheads</b><span>: Whiteheads, also known as closed comedones, are similar to blackheads in that they occur when the hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells. However, unlike blackheads, the pore remains closed, which prevents the trapped oil and dead skin cells from oxidizing and turning black. Whiteheads are typically small, white or flesh-coloured bumps that are not inflamed.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Topical medications like salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide can be used to treat pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads because they help to unclog pores and lessen inflammation. A dermatologist might advise oral medications like antibiotics and isotretinoin in more serious situations. </span></p>
<h3><b>Recognizing the Differences between Hormonal and Bacterial Acne</b></h3>
<p><span>Hormonal acne and bacterial acne look similar, but there are some key differences that can help determine which type of acne is present:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Location</b><span>: Bacterial acne is more frequently found on oily skin regions like the forehead, nose, and chin, while <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/hormonal-acne-causes-treatments-and-home-remedies">hormonal acne</a> is typically found on the lower face and jawline.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Timing</b><span>: Before menstruation or during ovulation are two times of the menstrual cycle when hormonal acne tends to worsen. Bacterial acne may be present at any time, but it may worsen during times of stress or hormonal fluctuations.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Type of lesion</b><span>: Bacterial acne is more likely to present as inflamed pimples, pustules, and cysts that are frequently red and tender to the touch, whereas hormonal acne is more likely to manifest as deep, painful cysts.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Existence of additional symptoms</b><span>: Additional hormonal imbalance symptoms, such as irregular periods, excessive hair growth, or hair loss, may coexist with hormonal acne. These symptoms are typically not brought on by bacterial acne.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Treatment response</b><span>: Hormonal acne may not respond well to conventional treatments for the condition, such as topical medications and antibiotics, and may need hormonal therapy.  On the other hand, bacterial acne typically responds favourably to topical and oral medications that target the infection causing bacteria.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>When to See a Dermatologist: Diagnosis and Treatment Options</b></h3>
<p><span>If acne is bothering you or affecting your daily activities, it may be time to see a dermatologist for a diagnosis and treatment options. A dermatologist can help identify the kind of acne and its underlying cause and provide personalized treatment recommendations. Here are a few indicators that you should consider seeing a dermatologist:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Treatments available over-the-counter are ineffective:</b><span>  It might be time to see a dermatologist if your acne is not clearing up after using over-the-counter medications like salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Severe acne</b><span>: If acne is severe and leaves scars, a dermatologist may recommend more aggressive treatments, such as oral medications or laser therapy.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hormonal acne</b><span>: If hormones are thought to be the cause of acne, a dermatologist can conduct hormone-level tests and offer options for hormonal therapy.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Psychological impact</b><span>: If acne is causing distress and impacting mental health, a dermatologist can provide treatment options and support.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Other symptoms</b><span>: Acne may be a sign of an underlying medical condition that needs to be evaluated and treated if it is accompanied by other symptoms like excessive hair growth, hair loss, or irregular periods.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><b>Treating Hormonal and Bacterial Acne</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="Identifying and Treating Different Types of Acne" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Vaishnavi_Blog_Image_-_4_3bb64f60-9173-47a3-b260-1ebc392e848a_480x480.jpg?v=1680605140"/></b></p>
<p><span>Depending on the severity and underlying cause of the acne, different treatments are available for hormonal and bacterial acne. Some frequent medical interventions include the following:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Topical medications</b><span>: Topical medications for mild to moderate acne, such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, can be effective.  These medications work by unclogging pores and reducing inflammation. In some cases, a topical antibiotic may be prescribed to help control bacteria.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Oral medications</b><span>: Oral antibiotics, such as tetracycline or doxycycline, can be effective in treating moderate to severe bacterial acne. Hormonal therapy, such as birth control pills or spironolactone, may be prescribed for women with hormonal acne. Isotretinoin, a powerful medication used to treat severe acne, may also be prescribed in some cases.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Chemical peels</b><span>: Chemical peels use acid solutions to remove the top layer of skin and can be effective in treating acne and reducing the appearance of scars.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Laser therapy</b><span>: Laser therapy can be used to reduce inflammation, kill bacteria, and stimulate collagen production, which can help to improve the appearance of acne and reduce scarring.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skincare routine</b><span>: Establishing a consistent skincare routine can also be effective in treating and preventing acne. This may include gentle cleansing, using non-comedogenic products, and avoiding picking or squeezing acne lesions.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Topical Treatments for Acne: Benzoyl Peroxide, Salicylic Acid, and Retinoids</b></h3>
<p><span>Treatment of mild to moderate acne with topical medications is sometimes successful. Three typical topical remedies for acne are listed below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Benzoyl peroxide</b><span>: This topical, over-the-counter medication works by eradicating bacteria and decreasing inflammation. It may work well in the treatment of mild to moderate acne. It is offered in strengths between 2.5% and 10%. However, because benzoyl peroxide has a tendency to dry out the skin and irritate some people, it's important to start with a lower strength and gradually build it up as tolerated. It is also important to use sunscreen when using benzoyl peroxide as it can increase sensitivity to the sun.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Salicylic acid</b><span>: Salicylic acid is another over-the-counter topical treatment that works by unclogging pores and reducing inflammation. It is effective in treating mild to moderate acne and can also be used to exfoliate the skin. It is available in strengths ranging from 0.5% to 2%. Salicylic acid is generally well tolerated, but when used in higher concentrations, it can result in dryness or irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Retinoids</b><span>: Retinoids are a type of prescription topical treatment that works by increasing skin cell turnover and preventing the formation of acne. They are effective in treating mild to moderate acne and can also help to reduce the appearance of acne scars. Retinoids can be irritating, especially when first starting treatment, so it is important to follow the dermatologist's instructions and use sunscreen when using retinoids as they can increase sensitivity to the sun.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Oral Treatments for Hormonal Acne: Birth Control Pills and Anti-Androgens</b></h3>
<p><span>An imbalance of hormones in the body is a common cause of hormonal acne. Oral medicines are another option for hormonal acne treatment, in addition to topical ones. Here are two examples of typical oral hormonal acne treatments:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Birth control pills</b><span>: Women who suffer from hormonal acne frequently turn to birth control pills as a treatment. They function by controlling hormone levels and lowering androgen production, which can hasten acne development. The most effective birth control pills for treating acne are those that combine estrogen and progestin. Contrary to popular belief, not all women are suitable candidates for the use of birth control pills, which may have adverse effects.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Anti-androgens</b><span>: Anti-androgens are a type of medication that blocks the effects of androgen hormones on the skin, which can help to reduce the severity of acne. Spironolactone is a commonly prescribed anti-androgen medication for women with hormonal acne. It works by blocking androgen receptors and reducing sebum production. However, spironolactone can have potential side effects and may not be suitable for everyone.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>The best oral medication for hormonal acne treatment should be chosen after <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">consulting a dermatologist</a>. They can aid in determining the root cause of the acne and offer advice on the best course of action. It's also important to remember that oral medications may not work for everyone and that results may not appear for a number of weeks.</span></p>
<h3><b>Oral Treatments for Bacterial Acne: Antibiotics and Other Medications</b></h3>
<p><span>There are many oral medications that can be used to treat bacterial acne, including antibiotics and other prescription drugs. Here are a few typical remedies:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Antibiotics</b><span>: Using antibiotics to treat bacterial acne is a common practice. The bacteria that cause acne are eliminated by them. Tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, and erythromycin are a few of the antibiotics that are frequently prescribed for acne. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Retinoids</b><span>: Retinoids are derivatives of <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/vitamin-b5-benefits-for-skin">vitamin A </a>and are used to treat acne by regulating skin cell growth and reducing inflammation. Isotretinoin is a powerful retinoid medication that is used to treat severe acne that has not responded to other treatments.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Birth control pills</b><span>: Some types of birth control pills can help to control acne in women by regulating hormone levels. Hormonal acne is often caused by an excess of androgens, male hormones that can stimulate the production of sebum, which can clog pores and lead to acne.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Spironolactone</b><span>: Spironolactone is a medication that is used to treat hormonal acne in women. It works by blocking the effects of androgens and reducing sebum production.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Anti-androgen drugs</b><span>: Other anti-androgen medications, such as flutamide and cyproterone acetate, can also be used to treat hormonal acne in women.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
