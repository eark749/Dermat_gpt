Origins
Loquat originated in the cooler, subtropical regions of southeastern China. It has been farmed there for thousands of years, first for the fruit and then for its therapeutic virtues.
Loquat cultivation migrated from China to Japan some 1,000 years ago, when it became a staple of Japanese agriculture and cuisine. The plant was later spread to the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, India, and, finally, the Americas, particularly in areas with moderate weather. Loquat originated in the cooler, subtropical regions of southeastern China. It has been farmed there for thousands of years, first for the fruit and then for its therapeutic virtues.
Cultivation Practices
Loquat flourishes in subtropical and mild temperate areas. It enjoys well-drained soil and demands plenty of sunlight. The plant can survive a variety of soil types, but it thrives in slightly acidic to neutral soils.
Loquat can be cultivated from seeds, however, grafting is more commonly used to ensure constant quality. Grafted plants develop fruit early and retain the favorable characteristics of their parent plant.

Nutrient Breakdown: Vitamins, Minerals, and Antioxidants in Loquat Leaf Extract
Loquat leaf extract contains a variety of elements that help to improve health. This is a complete breakdown of the vitamins, minerals, and
antioxidants
found in loquat leaf extract.:
Vitamins
Vitamin A is necessary for healthy skin and mucous membranes. It is essential for vision, immunity, and cellular communication. In terms of hair health, Vitamin A stimulates the production of sebum, which keeps the scalp moisturized and promotes healthy hair development.
Vitamin C
is a strong antioxidant that protects cells from free radical damage. It promotes
collagen
synthesis, which is essential for the structure and integrity of skin, blood vessels, and tissues, including the scalp and hair.
Minerals
Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that defends cells against free radical damage. It stimulates collagen synthesis, which is required for the structure and integrity of skin, blood vessels, and tissues, including the scalp and hair.
Magnesium is involved in more than 300 metabolic activities in the body, including protein synthesis, muscle and neuron function, and blood glucose regulation. Magnesium promotes hair growth by boosting protein synthesis and avoiding calcium buildup on the scalp, which can result in hair loss.
Antioxidants
Flavonoids are polyphenolic chemicals that are recognized to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Flavonoids found in loquat leaves, such as Quercetin and Kaempferol, help protect cells from oxidative stress and reduce inflammation, both of which can enhance scalp health and hair growth.
Phenolic acids are Compounds such as chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid have potent antioxidant effects. They assist to neutralise free radicals and prevent oxidative damage to cells and tissues, including those in the scalp.
Triterpenoids are chemicals that have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects. They protect the scalp from infections and irritation, promoting healthy hair growth
Saponins are natural glycosides that have antioxidant and immune-enhancing characteristics. Saponins found in loquat leaves reduce scalp irritation and promote overall scalp health.
