<h2><b>Why Add Glycolic Acid to Your Skincare Routine?</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="Glycolic Acid benefits" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Go_to_supplements_for_skin_health_b3793ff0-9e1f-4097-afa8-8021f222daf2_480x480.png?v=1685095073"/></b></p>
<p><span>Consider including glycolic acid in your skincare regimen for a number of reasons. The following are some of the main advantages of including glycolic acid in your regimen:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Exfoliation</b><span>: The alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) glycolic acid acts as an exfoliant. It encourages cellular turnover by assisting in the removal of dead skin cells from the skin's surface. This exfoliating action can <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/the-benefits-of-glycolic-acid-for-skincare-why-its-the-ultimate-exfoliant">improve the texture</a> and tone of your skin, making it softer, lighter, and more radiant.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Acne treatment</b><span>: Because of its exfoliating properties, glycolic acid is effective in treating acne. It helps to prevent the formation of acne and reduce the appearance of existing breakouts by unclogging pores and removing dead skin cells. Glycolic acid can also aid in the removal of post-inflammatory <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/anti-pigmentation">hyperpigmentation (PIH)</a>, which commonly occurs after acne lesions heal.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Effects on anti-aging</b><span>: Glycolic acid stimulates collagen production, which can make wrinkles, fine lines, and uneven skin texture less obvious. It improves skin elasticity and firmness, resulting in a more youthful and revitalised appearance.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reduced hyperpigmentation</b><span>: Glycolic acid can help fade hyperpigmentation such as sunspots, age spots, and melasma. Exfoliating the skin's upper layers promotes the turnover of pigmented cells, resulting in a more even skin tone.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Improved absorption of other skincare products</b><span>: Exfoliating with glycolic acid can improve the absorption of other skincare products that you use afterwards. By removing dead skin cells, glycolic acid allows serums, moisturisers, and other treatments to penetrate the skin more effectively, maximising their benefits.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skin brightening</b><span>: Using <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/aha-bha-range">glycolic acid</a> on a regular basis can help brighten dull and lacklustre skin. It aids in the removal of surface impurities, revealing a clearer, more vibrant complexion.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>When introducing glycolic acid into your skincare routine, begin with a low concentration and gradually increase frequency or potency as your skin adjusts. It's also important to wear sunscreen during the day because glycolic acid can make you more sensitive to the sun. Before applying glycolic acid to your entire face, as with any new skincare product, a patch test is recommended, especially if you have sensitive skin. A dermatologist can provide you with individualised advice and direction if you have any questions or particular skin conditions.</span></p>
<h3><b>Benefits of Glycolic Acid for Skincare</b></h3>
<p><span>The benefits of glycolic acid for skin care are numerous. Some of the main advantages of incorporating glycolic acid into your skincare routine are as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid works incredibly well as an exfoliant. Dead skin cells can be eliminated because of their tiny molecular size, which enables them to penetrate the skin deeply and dissolve the bonds that bind them. The process of exfoliation reveals new, more youthful-looking skin and enhances the overall texture and tone of your complexion.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid use on a regular basis can promote the exfoliation of dead skin cells, which can result in smoother skin. This can make the skin surface appear smoother and more even by minimising the visibility of fine lines, wrinkles, and rough patches.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Collagen Synthesis is Stimulated by Glycolic Acid in the Skin, Increasing Collagen Production. The protein collagen gives the skin its firmness, elasticity, and structural support. Glycolic acid helps to enhance collagen production, which helps to improve skin texture and lessen ageing symptoms like fine lines and sagging.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid can lighten <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/dark-spots-causes-treatment">hyperpigmentation</a>, including dark spots, sunspots, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) brought on by acne or other skin conditions. Glycolic acid promotes cell turnover, which helps to lighten and even out skin tone, resulting in a more balanced complexion.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid's ability to exfoliate skin makes it a successful acne treatment. It facilitates pore cleaning, lowers sebum and dead skin cell build-up, and hinders the development of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads). A clearer complexion and fewer acne outbreaks can result from the regular use of glycolic acid.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid improves the absorption of other skincare products by exfoliating the top layer of the skin. This maximises the benefits of active ingredients in serums, moisturisers, and treatments by enabling deeper penetration of those ingredients into the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid can <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/glycolic-acid-for-clear-bright-and-smooth-skin">brighten the skin </a>by removing old, lifeless skin cells to reveal younger, more vibrant skin underneath. It can enhance the overall luminosity of your skin and give your complexion a healthy glow.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Starting with a lower dosage and gradually increasing it as necessary is advised because glycolic acid can cause skin sensitivity and irritation, especially in people with sensitive skin. Additionally, because glycolic acid might make you more sensitive to the sun, it's important to use sunscreen throughout the day.</span></p>
<h2><b>Choosing the Right Glycolic Acid Products</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="Glycolic Acid benefits" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Introduction_1_98e9b283-b310-4211-a588-7f0aea647ab8_480x480.png?v=1685094967"/></b></p>
<p><span>You must take into account a few crucial factors when choosing glycolic acid products for your skincare regimen to make sure you pick the best ones for your skin. Here are some pointers to assist you in making the best decision:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Concentration</b><span>: Glycolic acid products come in a range of concentrations, typically between 5% and 30%. It's generally advised to start with a lower concentration of 5% to 10% if you're new to glycolic acid or have sensitive skin and to gradually increase the concentration if your skin tolerates it well. People with more resilient skin or those looking for more intensive exfoliation may benefit from higher concentrations. However, it's imperative to proceed with higher concentrations with caution and pay close attention to product instructions.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>pH Level</b><span>: The pH level of glycolic acid affects its potency. Choose products with a pH of 3 to 4, as these have the best exfoliating qualities. You can do research or contact the manufacturer to find out the pH of the product you're thinking about using because the pH level is not always stated on product packaging.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Product Type</b><span>: A few examples of products that contain glycolic acid include cleansers, toners, serums, peels, and creams. When deciding on a product type, take into account your preferences and the requirements of your skin. For instance, a glycolic acid cleanser or toner might be appropriate if you prefer a simple and quick step. Creams and serums can be layered with other products in your routine and allow for targeted application.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Other Ingredients</b><span>: Pay close attention to the product's formulation and additional ingredients. Some glycolic acid products might also include other healthy components like hyaluronic acid to hydrate the skin, niacinamide to brighten the skin, or calming ingredients like aloe vera or chamomile extract. Choose products that offer complementary advantages to address your unique needs while keeping in mind your skin concerns.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skin Sensitivity</b><span>: If you have sensitive skin or are prone to irritation, choose glycolic acid products that are designed for sensitive skin or have soothing ingredients added to reduce the risk of irritation. In order to ensure that your skin will accept the glycolic acid formulation, it is also advised to patch-test new products.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Brand Reputation</b><span>: It's generally advised to choose reputable brands that are recognized for their quality and safety when buying skincare products. Look for companies that place an emphasis on scientific research, product transparency, and satisfied customers.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Professional Advice</b><span>: It's always advisable to speak with a dermatologist or skincare expert if you're unsure of which glycolic acid products to pick or have specific skin concerns. Taking into account your skin type, issues, and any underlying diseases, they can offer tailored recommendations.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>When incorporating glycolic acid into your routine, keep an eye on how your skin is reacting and start out slowly. If you experience excessive dryness, redness, or irritation, reduce the frequency or concentration of glycolic acid use and, if necessary, consult a dermatologist. </span></p>
<h3><b>Glycolic Acid Cleansers</b></h3>
<p><span>Cleansers with glycolic acid as their primary active ingredient are skincare products. A form of alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) generated from sugarcane is glycolic acid. It is a water-soluble acid renowned for its ability to rejuvenate and exfoliate the skin. Cleansers containing glycolic acid are well known for their gentle exfoliation of the skin, removal of dead skin cells, the opening of clogged pores, and stimulation of cellular renewal. They can lessen the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, improve the texture and tone of the skin, and increase overall skin radiance.</span></p>
<p><span>When used as a cleanser, glycolic acid dissolves the bonds that hold dead skin cells together, making them easy to wash away.  This allows you to see younger, smoother skin beneath. Furthermore, glycolic acid can penetrate the skin's deeper layers, promoting collagen formation and improving skin suppleness.  It's important to remember that the active ingredient, glycolic acid, can cause minor side effects like stinging, dryness, or redness, especially in people with sensitive skin.  In general, it is best to start with a lower concentration and gradually increase it if it is well tolerated.</span></p>
<p><span>Think about your skin type and problems before selecting a glycolic acid cleanser. To balance and protect the skin, certain cleansers may also include extra components like moisturisers, antioxidants, or soothing agents. Glycolic acid can make skin more sensitive to the sun, so it's best to follow the product directions and minimise your time in the sun. Always seek the advice of a dermatologist or other skincare expert to ascertain whether glycolic acid cleansers are appropriate for your skin type and to receive personalised suggestions.</span></p>
<h3><b>Glycolic Acid Toners</b></h3>
<p><span>Glycolic acid is a significant element in the formulation of glycolic acid toners, which are skincare products. Toners are frequently applied after cleansing to get rid of any last-minute pollutants, balance the pH, and get the skin ready for the rest of your skincare regimen. To improve the texture and appearance of the skin, glycolic acid toners use the substance's exfoliating abilities. They function by gradually breaking down the connections that hold dead skin cells together, facilitating their clearance and exposing smoother, more luminous skin. Toners containing glycolic acid can also aid in pore cleaning, wrinkle reduction, and skin tone evenness.</span></p>
<p><span>It is critical to use glycolic acid toner in accordance with the product's instructions. If your skin tolerates it well, begin by applying it once or twice a week, gradually increasing the frequency. Before applying the product to your entire face, patch-test it on a small area of skin, especially if you have sensitive skin. It's essential to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF during the day when using a glycolic acid toner since glycolic acid can make skin more sensitive to the sun. This will lessen the chance of <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/the-long-term-effects-of-sun-damage-on-your-skin">sun damage</a> and help shield your skin from damaging UV radiation.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, you might want to think about starting with a lower concentration of glycolic acid and gradually working your way up to greater concentrations as your skin becomes accustomed to them if you're new to using glycolic acid or have very sensitive skin. Always seek the advice of a dermatologist or other skincare expert to ascertain whether glycolic acid toners are appropriate for your skin type and issues. Based on your unique needs, they can offer recommendations that are tailored just for you.</span></p>
<h3><b>Glycolic Acid Serums</b></h3>
<p><span>Glycolic acid is a fundamental component in concentrated serum formulations found in glycolic acid serums, which are skincare products. Serums are thin, highly concentrated cosmetics meant to penetrate the skin deeply with active ingredients. Because of their ability to regenerate the skin and exfoliate, glycolic acid serums are well-liked. They function by subtly breaking down the connections that hold dead skin cells together, encouraging their shedding, and exposing smoother, more radiant skin. Serums containing glycolic acid can help balance out skin tone, reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and enhance skin texture.</span></p>
<p><span>One benefit of utilising a glycolic acid serum is that, in comparison to cleansers or toners, the concentrated recipe allows for a higher amount of glycolic acid. This may result in more obvious skin renewal and exfoliating effects. It's crucial to remember that increased glycolic acid concentrations may also raise the risk of skin irritation, particularly for people with sensitive skin. Start with a lower concentration and progressively raise it if it is well tolerated.</span></p>
<p><span>It's essential to adhere to the recommendations and instructions on the glycolic acid serum's product label. A tiny amount of serum is often advised to be applied to clean, dry skin and gently massaged until fully absorbed. The general consensus is that serums should be applied in the evening, and then moisturiser should be applied. When using a glycolic acid serum during the day, it's crucial to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF because glycolic acid might make skin more sensitive to the sun. Before using the serum on your entire face, like with any skincare product, it's a good idea to patch-test a tiny area of skin, especially if you have sensitive skin.</span></p>
<p><span>Before adding a glycolic acid serum to your regimen, it is advised to speak with a dermatologist or skincare expert if you have any questions or specific skin disorders. They can evaluate your skin's requirements, make personalised recommendations, and advise you on the right concentration and frequency of application for the best outcomes with the least chance of causing irritation. </span></p>
<h3><b>Glycolic Acid Moisturizers</b></h3>
<p><span>Glycolic acid moisturisers are cosmetics that combine glycolic acid's exfoliating qualities with the advantages of moisturization. To hydrate the skin and encourage mild exfoliation and skin renewal, these moisturisers have glycolic acid as an active component. By eliminating dead skin cells and promoting cellular turnover, the glycolic acid included in moisturisers can help improve the texture and look of the skin. It can support a softer, more luminous complexion, lessen the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles, and smooth out rough skin.</span></p>
<p><span>The type and sensitivity of your skin should be taken into account while using a glycolic acid moisturiser. If you have sensitive skin, it is generally advised to start with a lower dosage of glycolic acid because it might be more potent in moisturisers than in cleansers or toners. You can progressively raise the concentration over time if your skin accepts it properly. It's important to use the moisturiser according to the manufacturer's directions. Moisturisers containing glycolic acid are typically applied to clean, dry skin and gently rubbed in until completely absorbed. When using a glycolic acid moisturiser, like with other glycolic acid products, it's crucial to use sunscreen with a high SPF during the day as it can make skin more sensitive to the sun.</span></p>
<h2><b>How Often Should You Use Glycolic Acid in Your Routine?</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="Glycolic Acid benefits" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Home_remedies_for_dry_dull_skin_1_45ea9d9e-777f-4f87-8786-5960aded9b8b_480x480.png?v=1685092122"/></b></p>
<p><span>Your skin type, sensitivity, and the amount of glycolic acid in the products you're using are some of the variables that will determine how frequently you use glycolic acid in your skincare routine. The following are some general principles:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Start slowly</b><span>: It's best to start with a lower concentration and use it less frequently if you're new to glycolic acid or have sensitive skin so that your skin can get used to it. Evaluate your skin's reaction after using glycolic acid products once or twice a week at first.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Increase frequency gradually</b><span>: You can increase the frequency of use if your skin tolerates glycolic acid well and doesn't show any signs of sensitivity or irritation. Depending on your skin's reaction, this could mean using it every other day or even daily.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Be mindful of your skin</b><span>: Since every person has a unique type of skin, it's important to pay attention to how your skin responds to glycolic acid. If you experience excessive dryness, redness, or irritation, reduce the frequency of use or the concentration of glycolic acid.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Alternate glycolic acid with rest days</b><span>: To prevent over-exfoliation and keep a balanced skincare regimen, think about alternating glycolic acid with rest days where you concentrate on gentle, hydrating products.

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Take expert advice into consideration</b><span>: It is recommended to speak with a dermatologist or other <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">skin care specialist </a>if you have particular skin issues or conditions. They can offer tailored advice based on your skin type, objectives, and any underlying problems you might be experiencing.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Always read the product's directions before using it, and be careful not to combine glycolic acid with any other substances or exfoliants that could cause irritation. Additionally, using glycolic acid can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, so it's important to wear sunscreen with a high SPF during the day. You may find the ideal balance to incorporate glycolic acid into your skincare routine successfully and safely by paying attention to your skin and modifying the frequency as necessary.</span></p>
<h3><b>Frequency of Use for Different Skin Types</b></h3>
<p><span>Your skin type will influence how frequently you use glycolic acid in your skincare regimen. The following suggestions are general:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Normal or Combination Skin</b><span>: If you have normal or combination skin that isn't overly sensitive or irritable, you can typically use glycolic acid products two to three times per week. This frequency can aid in skin exfoliation and renewal while minimising dryness and irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Dry or Sensitive Skin</b><span>: If you have dry or sensitive skin, you should use glycolic acid with caution. Begin with a lower concentration and use it sparingly, once or twice a week, to see how your skin reacts. If your skin tolerates it well, you can gradually increase the frequency, but always listen to your skin and reduce if irritation or dryness occurs.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Oily or Acne-Prone Skin</b><span>: Oily or acne-prone skin types can benefit from using glycolic acid more frequently to help control oiliness and promote skin cell turnover. A good approach is to start with 2 to 3 times per week and gradually increase the frequency as tolerated. However, keep an eye out for signs of over-exfoliation, such as excessive dryness or redness, and adjust the frequency as needed.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It's important to remember that these are only guidelines and that everyone's skin will react differently. Before introducing glycolic acid into your daily routine, it is usually a good idea to patch-test new products and watch how your skin reacts. Additionally, a dermatologist or skincare expert can offer tailored advice based on your unique skin type, issues, and any underlying illnesses you might be dealing with.</span></p>
<h2><b>Tips for Using Glycolic Acid Safely and Effectively</b></h2>
<p><span>Using glycolic acid in your skincare routine safely and effectively necessitates a few key considerations. Here are some pointers to help you integrate glycolic acid into your daily routine:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Perform a patch test on a small area of skin before using a glycolic acid product on your entire face. This will enable you to ascertain whether the product is irritating or insensitive to your skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Start with a product with a low concentration if you're new to glycolic acid or have sensitive skin. It is usually a good idea to start with a concentration of about 5–8%. You can, if you'd like, gradually raise the concentration as your skin gets used to it. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The glycolic acid product's instructions should always be read and followed. Pay close attention to the application techniques, recommended usage frequency, and any warnings.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Use glycolic acid products at night or as part of your night-time routine, as this is generally the best time to apply them. This prevents your skin from being exposed to sunlight overnight, which could increase the risk of sensitivity or irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Wearing sunscreen is essential because glycolic acid can make your skin more susceptible to the sun's rays. During the day, you should use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF. This lowers the possibility of sunburn or sun damage while also assisting in shielding your skin from damaging UV rays.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid can potentially cause dryness or mild irritation, so it's important to incorporate a hydrating moisturiser into your routine. In order to keep your skin balanced and moisturised, look for moisturisers that are appropriate for your skin type and offer enough hydration.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Avoid overusing glycolic acid, despite the fact that it is effective for exfoliating and renewing the skin. Excessive exfoliation can result in skin sensitivity, dryness, or a weakened skin barrier. If you experience any signs of irritation, pay attention to your skin and change the frequency and concentration of glycolic acid use.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>A dermatologist or other skincare expert should always be consulted if you have particular skin issues or conditions. They can evaluate your skin's requirements, make tailored recommendations, and advise you on how to use glycolic acid effectively for your skin type.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>These guidelines will help you safely and effectively add glycolic acid to your skincare regimen in order to improve skin texture, encourage skin renewal, and reveal a more radiant complexion.</span></p>
<h3><b>How to Patch Test Glycolic Acid Products</b></h3>
<p><span>The most important step in determining whether your skin may have any negative reactions or sensitivity to the substance is to patch-test glycolic acid products. Here's how to successfully patch test goods containing glycolic acid:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Select a modest test area</b><span>: Choose a small, discrete area of skin, like the inside of your arm or the area behind your ear. You'll be able to see any reactions without them being immediately obvious if you do this.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cleanse the area</b><span>: Make sure the test area is spotless and free of any residues from previous skincare applications, lotions, or products.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Apply a small amount</b><span>: Use your finger to gently pat the patch test area with a small amount of the glycolic acid product. Make sure to follow the instructions provided with the product regarding the amount to use.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Wait and observe</b><span>: For the recommended amount of time specified in the directions, let the product stay in the patch test area. In general, this lasts for around 24 hours, but check the requirements for the particular product.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Check for reactions</b><span>: After the allotted time has passed, carefully inspect the patch test area for any symptoms of sensitivity, including swelling, redness, itching, or discomfort. Use should be stopped right away if you have any negative effects.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Monitor for 48 hours</b><span>: Although initial reactions may become apparent within the first 24 hours, it is advised to keep checking the patch test area for any potential delayed reactions for an additional 24 hours.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>If the results of the patch test show that your skin is not irritated or reacts unfavourably to the glycolic acid product, it is generally safe to apply it to a larger area of your skin. But if you have any side effects, it's best to cease using the product entirely or to consult a dermatologist or skincare specialist. To find out how a new product may affect your skin, always do a patch test. Particularly when utilising active ingredients like glycolic acid, this is essential.</span></p>
<h3><b>How to Avoid Over-Exfoliating with Glycolic Acid</b></h3>
<p><span>Over-exfoliating with glycolic acid can damage your skin barrier and cause skin irritability, dryness, and redness. Here are some pointers to help you use glycolic acid sparingly and avoid over-exfoliating:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>If you're new to glycolic acid or have sensitive skin, start with a lower concentration. Begin with a concentration of around 5-8% and gradually increase it over time if your skin tolerates it well.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Follow the instructions that came with the glycolic acid product. Start by using it once or twice a week to see how your skin reacts. If there is no irritation, gradually increase the frequency.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Avoid using other exfoliating products, such as physical scrubs or other chemical exfoliants, at the same time as glycolic acid. Using multiple exfoliants at the same time raises the risk of over-exfoliation and irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Pay attention to your skin's reaction and make necessary adjustments. Reduce the quantity or frequency of using glycolic acid if you experience any symptoms of excessive dryness, redness, or irritation. Finding the right balance requires listening to your skin and following its cues.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Alternate rest days with exfoliating days by including rest days in your skin care regimen when you don't use any exfoliating products, including glycolic acid. This allows your skin to rest and renew itself without being constantly scrubbed.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Use hydrating and nourishing products in your skincare regimen to support your skin's moisture barrier. Hydrate and moisturise. To keep your skin hydrated and in balance, look for moisturisers and serums that contain hydrating components like hyaluronic acid, ceramides, or niacinamide.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Sunscreen protection is essential during the daytime because glycolic acid can make skin more sensitive to sunlight. This helps shield your skin from damaging UV rays and stops further harm.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>It's best to speak with a dermatologist or skincare expert if you're unsure of how to incorporate glycolic acid into your skincare routine or if you have particular skin concerns. Depending on your skin type and concerns, they can offer you individualised advice and direction.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>You can use glycolic acid effectively without over-exfoliating and achieve the desired results while maintaining healthy skin if you abide by these guidelines and are aware of the requirements and reactions of your skin.</span></p>
<h3><b>How to Combine Glycolic Acid with Other Skincare Products</b></h3>
<p><span>In order to maximise its effectiveness and lower the likelihood of discomfort, it's critical to consider how to incorporate glycolic acid with other products into your skincare routine. Following these recommendations will help you use glycolic acid in combination with other skincare products:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Cleanse</b><span>: Begin by washing your face with a mild cleanser to begin your skincare regimen. Before using glycolic acid or any other skincare products, make sure your skin is clean and free of any dirt, oil, or makeup.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consider the pH level</b><span>: Glycolic acid works best at a lower pH level. After cleansing, use a toner or pH-adjusting product to lower the pH of your skin to maximise its effectiveness. This helps to ensure that the glycolic acid can function properly.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Layering order</b><span>: To maximise the benefits of your skincare products while minimising any potential interactions, layer them in the correct order. Apply glycolic acid products after cleansing and toning but before thicker products such as moisturisers or oils. This makes it possible for glycolic acid to effectively penetrate the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Test new products on a small area first</b><span>: It's always a good idea to patch-test new skincare products before using them in conjunction with glycolic acid. This assists in identifying any negative interactions or reactions between the products.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use only one exfoliating product at a time</b><span>: Using multiple exfoliating products at once can lead to irritation and over-exfoliation. In order to avoid over-exfoliating the skin while using glycolic acid, it's usually best to skip physical exfoliants like scrubs or bushes that day.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydrate and moisturise</b><span>: Use hydrating products like serums or moisturisers after using glycolic acid. These aid in rehydrating and nourishing the skin. Look for products that contain hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, ceramides, or natural oils to help maintain a healthy skin barrier.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sunscreen use</b><span>: Your skin may become more photosensitive if you use glycolic acid. Therefore, when using glycolic acid, it's essential to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF during the day. By doing so, you shield your skin from damaging UV rays and stop additional damage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Listen to your skin</b><span>: When combining glycolic acid with other products, pay attention to how your skin responds. If your skin exhibits any symptoms of irritability, dryness, or redness, the mixture can be too abrasive for your skin. Adapt the items or their usage frequency as necessary.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>If you have any concerns about using glycolic acid with specific ingredients or questions about specific product combinations, it's always a good idea to consult a doctor or skincare specialist. They can provide tailored advice based on your skin type, issues, and the specific products you're using.</span></p>

<h2><b>Glycolic Acid and Sun Protection</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="Glycolic Acid Benefits " src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/What_is_cetyl_alcohol_288df7a7-2de3-44a0-8e97-19cba23775df_480x480.png?v=1685092823"/></b></p>
<p><span>Sun protection must always come first when using glycolic acid because it exfoliates the skin and can lead to skin sensitivity. Take into account the following significant information regarding glycolic acid and sun protection:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Greater sensitivity to the sun's harmful rays</b><span>: Glycolic acid can make your skin more vulnerable to the damaging effects of UV radiation. It exfoliates dead skin cells and may momentarily thin your skin's top layer, making it more susceptible to sunburn, sun damage, and pigmentation problems.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Wear sunscreen every day</b><span>: It's critical to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF (at least SPF 30) every day, even if you're not in the sun. Apply sunscreen as the final step in your morning skincare routine, making sure to cover all exposed areas completely.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reapply sunscreen</b><span>: You should reapply sunscreen every two hours, or more often if you're sweating or doing other activities that could remove or weaken its protective layer. Pay close attention to the directions on the sunscreen product you are using.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Choose physical sunscreens</b><span>: When using glycolic acid, physical sunscreens with ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are generally thought to be safer. They function by forming a physical barrier that either scatters or reflects UV rays on the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid harsh products and chemical exfoliants</b><span>: Combining glycolic acid with other <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/aha-vs-bha-in-your-skincare-routine">chemical exfoliants</a> like BHAs or AHAs is not recommended. You could become more sensitive to the sun as a result of the cumulative exfoliating effects. Along with glycolic acid, keep away from harsh or possibly irritating products since they increase the possibility of sunburn or other negative effects.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Look for shade, and dress to stay covered</b><span>: When possible, seek shade, especially during the hottest parts of the day, in addition to using sunscreen. Additionally, wearing protective clothing, such as long sleeve shirts, hats, and sunglasses, can add an additional layer of protection from UV rays.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use sunless tanners with caution</b><span>: If you're using glycolic acid to exfoliate and improve skin texture, keep in mind that sunless tanners can react differently with exfoliated skin. Consult your sunless tanner's instructions and consider adjusting the frequency or concentration of glycolic acid use accordingly.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Remember that sun protection is essential not only when using glycolic acid, but also as a general practice for maintaining healthy skin. You can enjoy the benefits of glycolic acid while minimising the risk of sun damage by incorporating sun protection measures into your skincare routine.</span></p>
<h3><b>How Glycolic Acid Effects Sun Sensitivity</b></h3>
<p><span>Glycolic acid can increase sun sensitivity, making your skin more vulnerable to UV radiation's harmful effects. The following is how glycolic acid effects sun sensitivity:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid is an exfoliating agent that aids in the removal of dead skin cells and promotes skin cell turnover. This exfoliation process can temporarily thin the skin's outer layer, making it more vulnerable to sun damage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid's exfoliating action can disrupt the <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/dms-technology-for-skin-barrier-repair">skin barrier function</a>. The skin barrier serves as a barrier against external factors such as UV radiation. When the skin barrier is compromised, the skin's natural ability to defend against UV damage is reduced.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid can improve the penetration of other skincare products, including UV radiation. This means that if you apply glycolic acid to your skin and then expose it to the sun without adequate sun protection, UV rays can penetrate deeper into the skin, causing increased sun sensitivity and potential damage.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Although glycolic acid can make people more sensitive to the sun, each person will experience this sensitivity to a different degree. When using glycolic acid, some people might be more susceptible to sunburn or sun damage, but others might not notice a noticeable increase in sensitivity. Sun protection must come first in order to mitigate the effects of glycolic acid-induced sun sensitivity. This includes using a high SPF broad-spectrum sunscreen, seeking shade when the sun is at its strongest, and wearing protective gear such as hats and sunglasses. By incorporating these sun protection strategies into your skincare routine, you can reduce the risk of sun damage when using glycolic acid. </span></p>
<h3><b>Tips for Protecting Your Skin While Using Glycolic Acid</b></h3>
<p><span>When using glycolic acid in your skincare regimen, it is critical to protect your skin from potential side effects and sun sensitivity. Keep your skin safe when using glycolic acid by following these guidelines:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Wear sunscreen</b><span>: Use broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF (at least SPF 30) every day, even if you're not in the sun. Apply it last in your skincare routine and reapply every two hours, or more frequently if you're sweating or swimming.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Choose physical sunscreens</b><span>: Physical sunscreens with ingredients such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide form a physical barrier on the skin, blocking and reflecting UV rays. They are generally regarded as safer when using glycolic acid because they do not penetrate the skin and provide immediate protection.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid sun exposure during peak hours</b><span>: Try to limit your sun exposure, especially between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when the sun's rays are at their strongest. Seek shade or wear protective clothing such as hats, sunglasses, and long sleeves to reduce direct sun exposure.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Wear protective clothing</b><span>: Wear clothing made of tightly woven fabrics to cover exposed areas of your skin. This adds another layer of protection against UV rays.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid using other exfoliating products</b><span>: Do not combine glycolic acid with other exfoliating products, such as physical scrubs or other chemical exfoliants, to avoid over-exfoliation and potential irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydrate and moisturise</b><span>: Glycolic acid occasionally causes dryness or slight irritation. Use moisturisers that are right for your skin type to hydrate it. If you want to restore and keep the skin's moisture balance, look for products that contain hyaluronic acid, ceramides, or natural oils.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Introduce glycolic acid gradually</b><span>: Start with a lower concentration if you have sensitive skin or are new to using glycolic acid, and then gradually increase it as your skin gets used to it. This reduces the likelihood of irritation while also allowing your skin to adjust.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Take notice of your skin</b><span>: Keep an eye on how your skin reacts to glycolic acid. Reduce the amount of glycolic acid you use or the frequency with which you use it if you experience excessive dryness, redness, or irritation. Finding the right balance requires listening to your skin and following its cues.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Speak with a dermatologist</b><span>: It is best to speak with a dermatologist or other skincare specialist if you have particular skin issues or are unsure about using glycolic acid. They can offer you individualised guidance based on your skin type, issues, and the particular products you're using.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>You can effectively safeguard your skin while using glycolic acid and reduce the possibility of adverse effects or sun sensitivity by keeping in mind these suggestions.</span></p>
