<p><span>Skin that has thickened due to frequent pressure or friction is known as a "callus." They can develop in various regions of the body, although they usually show up on the hands or feet. Even though calluses are typically not harmful, they can be unsightly, and uncomfortable, and in some instances, they may even need to be treated. A common problem, calluses are typically treatable with straightforward self-care techniques. Consult a healthcare professional for advice on the best course of action if you have concerns about a callus or are feeling pain or inflammation.</span></p>
<h2><b>Defining Calluses</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="What is a Callus?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/HOW_TO_PREVENT_CORNS_AND_CALLUSES_2_480x480.png?v=1683701463"/></b></p>
<p><span>Areas of skin that have hardened due to frequent pressure or friction are called calluses. Although they can develop on other parts of the body as well, they most frequently show up on the hands and feet. Although calluses are typically not a cause for concern, they can be unsightly and uncomfortable and, in some instances, may need to be treated.</span></p>
<h3><b>What is a Callus?</b></h3>
<p><span>A patch of thicker skin that develops as a defensive reaction to repetitive pressure or friction is called a callus. Any area of the body that is exposed to these forces can develop calluses, but the hands and feet are where they tend to appear most frequently. Although calluses are generally not harmful, they can be unsightly and uncomfortable and, in some cases, may need to be treated. In severe cases, calluses may hurt or even crack, which raises the possibility of an infection.</span></p>
<h3><b>Causes of Callus Formation</b></h3>
<p><span>Calluses develop as a result of constant friction or pressure on the skin. The following are a few typical callus formation triggers:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Repetitive use of the hands or feet</b><span>: Activities involving repetitive use of the hands or feet, such as playing musical instruments, using hand tools, or running, can result in the development of calluses.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Poorly fitting footwear</b><span>: Calluses can develop as a result of friction on the feet from footwear that is either too tight or too loose.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Heavy manual work</b><span>: People who perform heavy manual work, such as farmers or construction workers, are more likely to develop calluses.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Abnormalities in the structure of the foot or hand</b><span>: People who have abnormalities in the structure of their hands or feet, such as flat feet or high arches, may be more prone to callus development.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Age-related changes</b><span>: As people get older, their skin loses elasticity and is more likely to develop calluses. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Certain medical conditions</b><span>: Some medical conditions, like diabetes, can make callus formation more likely.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Common Locations for Calluses</b></h3>
<p><span>Although calluses can develop on any area of the body that experiences constant pressure or friction, they are most frequently found on the hands and feet. Calluses can develop in a variety of places, such as:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>The soles of the feet</b><span>: Wearing shoes that are too tight or too loose, as well as standing or walking for extended periods of time, are common causes of calluses that develop on the soles of the feet.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The palms of the hands</b><span>: Using hand tools, playing musical instruments, or engaging in other activities that require repetitive gripping or rubbing can result in calluses on the palms of the hands.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Fingers and toes</b><span>: Calluses can also form on the fingers and toes, particularly in people who play stringed instruments or engage in other activities that require repeated pressure on the fingertips.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Knees and elbows</b><span>: Crawling or leaning on hard surfaces frequently results in calluses on the knees and elbows.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Buttocks</b><span>: People who spend a lot of time sitting on hard surfaces, like bicycle seats, can develop calluses on their buttocks.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><b>Identifying and Diagnosing Calluses</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="What is a Callus?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/HOW_TO_PREVENT_CORNS_AND_CALLUSES_3_480x480.png?v=1683701521"/></b></p>
<p><span>Because of how they appear, calluses are frequently easy to recognize. They often manifest as thickened, dry, and yellowish-colored skin patches. If they are on pressure points like the soles of the feet, they may be unpleasant or tender to the touch. A medical professional can occasionally need to look at the callus in order to diagnose a patient. In the course of a physical examination, a doctor might:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Examine the affected area</b><span>: The healthcare provider will look for signs of thickening, dryness, or discoloration as they examine the affected area of the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Examine your symptoms</b><span>: Your doctor might inquire about any symptoms you may be having, such as pain or tenderness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Take a medical history</b><span>: The medical professional might inquire about your past health, including any skin conditions or injuries.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Order tests</b><span>: In some circumstances, the medical professional may ask for tests, such as a skin biopsy, to rule out other conditions that could be the source of the thickening of the skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>The healthcare professional may suggest treatment to thin the skin and relieve symptoms if the callus is causing severe pain or discomfort.</span></p>
<h3><b>Signs and Symptoms</b></h3>
<p>Skin that has become thick and hardened due to frequent friction or pressure is known as a callus. They frequently manifest as elevated or flat, yellowish or greyish areas of skin. The hands, feet, or other places that experience constant rubbing or pressure, including the elbows or knees, are where calluses often form. The following are typical callus symptoms and signs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Skin that has thickened or hardened</b><span>: The affected area's skin may become thicker and more durable than the skin around it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Yellowish or greyish in color</strong>: The skin may be raised or flat and appear yellowish or greyish in color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Pain or tenderness</b><span>: If pressure is applied, the callus area may be painful or tender to the touch.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Gripping or walking difficulties</b><span>: Calluses on the hands or feet can make it difficult to grip objects or walk comfortably.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skin cracking or flaking</b><span>: In severe cases, the skin around the callus may crack or flake.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>If you experience any of these symptoms, you should seek medical attention immediately to prevent the callus from becoming more painful or infected.</span></p>
<h3><b>Differentiating Calluses from Corns</b></h3>
<p>The soles of the feet, the palms of the hands, and other places that experience constant rubbing or pressure are where calluses often form. They typically appear as flat or elevated yellowish or greyish areas of skin. Calluses are frequently less painful than corns and are typically bigger and wider. On the other hand, corns are more confined and smaller patches of thickened skin that generally appear on the sides or toes of the feet. They frequently have an uncomfortable centre core that can even feel like a stone in your shoe. Corns are frequently surrounded by calloused skin, and depending on where they are, they can either be hard or soft. While calluses and corns can be treated similarly, it is crucial to distinguish between the two in order to choose the right course of action. Once the problem has been identified, a healthcare professional can advise you on the best course of action for your particular circumstances.</p>
<h2><b>When to Consult a Healthcare Professional</b></h2>
<p><span>The majority of calluses may be treated at home with over-the-counter medications and dietary modifications, but there are some instances when it is important to speak with a healthcare provider. If any of the following apply, you should think about seeking medical advice:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>You suffer from diabetes or another illness that impairs your immune system or circulatory system. These conditions can also increase the risk of complications, such as infection, making it more difficult for calluses to heal.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>You have a painful callus, especially if it makes it difficult for you to walk or use your hands.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Your callus is bleeding, oozing pus, or exhibiting other infection-related symptoms like redness, warmth, or swelling.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>You've been attempting at-home remedies for a number of weeks now without much luck.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>You have a family history of melanoma or a history of skin cancer.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It is always best to seek advice from a healthcare professional if you are unsure of your callus's severity or the best course of treatment. They can assist in identifying the root cause of your callus and suggest the best course of action.</span></p>

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use cushioning</b><span>: To help distribute pressure and lessen friction on your feet, use cushioned insoles, pads, or orthotics.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Practice good foot hygiene</b><span>: Wash your feet regularly and keep them clean and dry. To remove dead skin, use a pumice stone or a foot file.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Moisturize</b><span>: Use a moisturizing cream or lotion to keep your feet soft and prevent dry, cracked skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Trim calluses</b><span>: If a callus is causing pain or discomfort, a healthcare professional may advise you to trim it to relieve pressure.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid repetitive motions</b><span>: Avoid repetitive motions that can cause calluses, such as playing musical instruments or gripping tools for extended periods of time.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Treat underlying conditions</b><span>: If a callus is caused by an underlying condition, such as a bone deformity or foot misalignment, treating the underlying condition can help prevent the formation of a callus.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>By following these guidelines, you can help prevent callus formation and reduce the severity of existing calluses. If you have a callus that is causing you pain or discomfort, or if you are unsure of the best course of treatment, seek the advice of a healthcare professional. </span></p>
<h3><b>Home Care and Remedies</b></h3>
<p><span>In addition to the previously mentioned tips for treating and preventing calluses, the following home care remedies can help soften and reduce the thickness of calluses:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Soak your feet</b><span>: Soaking your feet in warm, soapy water can soften the skin and make removing calluses easier. You can also add Epsom salt or baking soda to the water to help soften the skin even more.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use a pumice stone</b><span>: After soaking your feet, use a pumice stone or foot file to gently scrub away dead skin and reduce the thickness of the callus. Avoid over-scrubbing or removing too much skin, as these actions can result in bleeding and discomfort.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Apply moisturizer</b><span>: After you've removed the callus, moisturize your feet with a cream or lotion to keep the skin soft and prevent dry, cracked skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use a callus pad</b><span>: Callus pads can be placed over the afflicted area to aid in pressure distribution and decrease friction, which can stop calluses from forming or worsening.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use apple cider vinegar</b><span>: Applying a cotton ball soaked in the vinegar to the callus for a few hours can help soften the skin and lessen the callus' thickness.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It's important to remember that while these at-home treatments can be beneficial, they might not work for all callus types. Consult a healthcare professional for advice if a callus is causing pain or discomfort or if it does not get better with home care.</span></p>
<h3><b>Over-the-Counter Treatments</b></h3>
<p><span>There are many over-the-counter (OTC) callus treatments available. These consist of:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Callus cushions and pads:</b><span> These are gentle pads that can be placed over the callus to lessen pressure and provide cushioning. They are typically made of materials like foam or gel and are available at most drugstores.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Salicylic acid</b><span>: This is a type of acid that can help dissolve the dead skin cells that make up calluses. It comes in a variety of forms, including creams, pads, and drops, and is available at most drugstores. Salicylic acid should only be used in accordance with the instructions because, if not, it can irritate the skin around it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Moisturizing creams and lotions</b><span>: Applying a moisturizing cream or lotion to the affected area can help soften the skin and reduce the thickness of the callus over time.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Callus removers</b><span>: These are special tools designed to help remove calluses. They are typically made of materials like plastic or stainless steel and are available at most drugstores.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It is critical to carefully read and follow the instructions on OTC treatments, as some products may not be appropriate for all individuals or may have potential side effects. If a callus does not improve with over-the-counter treatments or is causing pain or discomfort, seek advice from a healthcare professional.</span></p>
<h3><b>Professional Callus Removal</b></h3>
<p><span>It can be necessary to seek expert care from a podiatrist or dermatologist for severe or persistent calluses. A healthcare professional can administer more intensive treatments that are not available over the counter. The following are professional callus removal techniques:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Debridement:</b><span> Using a sharp tool or blade, the thickened skin is removed. This is usually carried out in a medical professional's office.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Salicylic acid with a prescription</b><span>: A medical professional may suggest a stronger dosage of salicylic acid or other drugs to help dissolve the callus.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Custom orthotics</b><span>: These unique shoe inserts are made to distribute pressure on the foot more evenly and lessen the likelihood of callus development.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Surgery</b><span>: In a few uncommon circumstances, surgery might be required to remove a stubborn callus.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>When receiving professional callus removal treatments, it's crucial to carefully adhere to the doctor's instructions and keep all scheduled follow-up appointments.</span></p>
