<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Cleanse Your Skin</b><span>: To begin, use a mild <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-foaming-face-wash">cleanser</a> that is appropriate for your skin type to completely cleanse your skin. This ensures that the soursop extract oil can penetrate efficiently by clearing away debris, oil, and contaminants. To prevent depriving your skin of its natural oils, use lukewarm water.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Exfoliate (Optional)</b><span>: To improve absorption and get rid of dead skin cells, exfoliate your skin 1-2 times per week with a mild scrub or a chemical exfoliant (such as an AHA or BHA). Refrain from over-exfoliating since this may cause skin irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Tone</b><span>: Use a toner to bring your skin's pH balance back into equilibrium and get it ready for better product absorption. Toner without alcohol should be used to prevent drying out your skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use the Appropriate Amount</b><span>: Fill the palm of your hand with two to three drops of soursop extract oil. Adapt the quantity according to the demands of the area you are treating and your skin. If necessary, start with a smaller quantity and increase it, particularly if you have combination or oily skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Warm the Oil</b><span>: To gently warm the oil, massage your palms together. This facilitates improved absorption by activating the compounds. Additionally, spreading the oil evenly over your skin is made easier by warming it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Apply to Face and Neck</b><span>: Using soft, upward strokes, pat the oil onto your face and neck. Pay attention to areas that are prone to inflammation or that require more<a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hyaluronic-skinbooster-serum"> hydration</a>. Refrain from rubbing too vigorously as this may irritate. To massage the oil into your skin, apply mild pressure.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Layering with Other Products</b><span>: To seal in the hydration, use your usual moisturiser after applying the soursop extract oil. Apply products ranging in consistency from thinnest to thickest. Apply serums, for instance, before oils and moisturisers.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Facial Massage</b><span>: Apply light pressure to your face in order to improve absorption and blood circulation. Pay attention to the jawline, cheeks, and forehead. To massage your face, use a facial roller or your fingertips. Additionally, it can ease stress and encourage calm.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Spot Treatment</b><span>: Using a cotton swab or clean fingertip, apply a tiny amount of soursop extract oil directly to the problematic area for specific concerns including acne, scars, or irritated regions. Let the oil absorb completely before adding more items on top.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Application in the Morning and Evening</b><span>: For optimum effects, apply soursop extract oil in the morning and the evening. Using the oil often can help you stay hydrated and get the most out of it.
