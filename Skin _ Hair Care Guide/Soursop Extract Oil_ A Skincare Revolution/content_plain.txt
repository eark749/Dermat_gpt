Use the Appropriate Amount
: Fill the palm of your hand with two to three drops of soursop extract oil. Adapt the quantity according to the demands of the area you are treating and your skin. If necessary, start with a smaller quantity and increase it, particularly if you have combination or oily skin.
Warm the Oil

Apply to Face and Neck
: Using soft, upward strokes, pat the oil onto your face and neck. Pay attention to areas that are prone to inflammation or that require more
hydration
. Refrain from rubbing too vigorously as this may irritate. To massage the oil into your skin, apply mild pressure.
Layering with Other Products
: To seal in the hydration, use your usual moisturiser after applying the soursop extract oil. Apply products ranging in consistency from thinnest to thickest. Apply serums, for instance, before oils and moisturisers.
Facial Massage
: Apply light pressure to your face in order to improve absorption and blood circulation. Pay attention to the jawline, cheeks, and forehead. To massage your face, use a facial roller or your fingertips. Additionally, it can ease stress and encourage calm.
Spot Treatment
: Using a cotton swab or clean fingertip, apply a tiny amount of soursop extract oil directly to the problematic area for specific concerns including acne, scars, or irritated regions. Let the oil absorb completely before adding more items on top.
Application in the Morning and Evening
