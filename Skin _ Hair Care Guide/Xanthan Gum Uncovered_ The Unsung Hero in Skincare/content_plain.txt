Xanthan gum is a polysaccharide that is created when a particular bacterial strain ferments simple sugars. Its extraordinary ability to stabilise and thicken liquids makes it a fantastic ingredient for skincare and personal care products. The versatile and advantageous ingredient xanthan gum can improve the consistency, texture, and efficacy of skincare and personal care products. While it may not be as glamorous as other skincare ingredients, this one is well worth considering for its numerous benefits.
Demystifying Xanthan Gum in Skincare
Natural Xanthan gum is frequently used in skincare and cosmetic products as a thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier. It is a polysaccharide derived from carbohydrate fermentation, primarily corn, soy, or wheat. At low concentrations, xanthan gum is a high molecular weight polymer that is highly water soluble and can form highly viscous solutions. It is frequently used to increase spreadability and skin absorption, prevent ingredient separation, and enhance product consistency and texture in skincare formulations. Xanthan gum has moisturising and conditioning properties in addition to thickening and stabilising effects on the skin.   It creates a shield-like layer on the skin's surface to help it retain moisture and stop transepidermal water loss (TEWL), which can result in dryness and dehydration.
What is Xanthan Gum?
The food industry frequently uses natural xanthan gum as a thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier.  The bacterium Xanthomonas campestris produces a type of carbohydrate called a polysaccharide by fermenting simple sugars. Xanthan gum is an effective ingredient in various food products, including sauces, dressings, and baked goods, because it is water soluble and can create highly viscous solutions at low concentrations. A wide range of other products, including medicines, cosmetics, and personal care items, also use xanthan gum outside of the food industry. Xanthan gum is frequently used as a thickener and stabiliser in skincare and cosmetic products to enhance the formulation's texture and consistency, prevent ingredient separation, and enhance the product's spreadability and absorption on the skin.  It is a well-liked component in skin care formulations because it has moisturising and skin-conditioning qualities.
How Xanthan Gum is Produced
The bacterium Xanthomonas campestris is used in the fermentation process to produce xanthan gum. The bacteria are first grown in a nutrient-rich medium, which is typically made of corn, soy, or wheat. As a by-product of their metabolism, the bacteria produce xanthan gum. Long chains of glucose molecules are produced by the bacteria during fermentation, and these chains are later altered by enzymes to produce the finished product known as xanthan gum. The finished item has a unique molecular make-up that bestows thickening, stabilising, and emulsifying qualities. It is a highly viscous, water-soluble polysaccharide. After fermentation, the xanthan gum is purified, dried, and ground into a fine powder. The powder is then packaged and shipped to producers, who use it in various goods like skincare, personal care, food, and medications.
Xanthan Gum's Role in Skincare Products
As a thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier, xanthan gum is essential in many skincare products. It is commonly used to improve the texture, consistency, and overall performance of formulations such as creams, lotions, serums, and gels. Xanthan gum, as a thickener, can help give products a smooth, creamy texture and keep them from separating or settling over time. It can also help improve product spreadability, making it easier to apply and absorb into the skin. When products are exposed to heat, light, or air, xanthan gum acts as a stabiliser to stop product deterioration or potency loss.  It can also help products last longer by inhibiting the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms. As an emulsifier, xanthan gum can aid in the combination of oil and water-based ingredients in formulations, resulting in stable, homogeneous products that are easy to apply and distribute evenly.
