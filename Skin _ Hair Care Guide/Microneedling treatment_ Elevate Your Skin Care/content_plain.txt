Understanding Microneedling: A Closer Look at the Treatment
Undergoing professional microneedling involves a series of steps and considerations. Here's what you can typically expect:
Consultation:
Your journey begins with a
consultation
with a skincare professional. They'll assess your skin type, discuss your skincare goals, and determine if microneedling is suitable for you. They may also discuss your medical history to identify any potential contraindications.
Preparation:
Before the procedure, you'll be advised to avoid certain medications and activities that can increase bleeding, like taking aspirin or engaging in vigorous exercise. Sun protection is also crucial.
Procedure Day:
Cleansing:
Your skin will be thoroughly cleansed to remove any makeup, oils, or dirt.
Anaesthesia:
A topical anaesthetic cream is applied to minimise discomfort during the procedure.
Microneedling Process:
Using a sterilised microneedling device, the professional will create tiny punctures in the skin. This process typically takes about 30 minutes, depending on the treatment area.
4. Post-Procedure Care:
Immediate Care: Your skin will likely appear red and may feel warm and tight. You might experience mild swelling.
Healing: Over the next few days, follow the skincare routine recommended by your professional. This may include gentle
cleansing
, hydrating serums, and broad-spectrum
sunscreen
.
Avoiding Certain Products: You'll be advised to avoid irritating substances like retinoids or alcohol-based toners for a short period.
Recovery Time: Recovery is usually quick, with redness subsiding within a few days. However, the healing process varies depending on the individual and the intensity of the treatment.
5. Follow-up Treatments:
Multiple sessions, typically spaced 4-6 weeks apart, are often needed for optimal results.
6. Results:
Initial improvement can be seen within a few weeks, with more significant results appearing after several months as collagen production increases.
The Science Behind Microneedling: How It Works for Skin Rejuvenation
Microneedling creates small and minute injuries on the top-most layer of the skin using sterilised needles. As a result, these injuries lead to superficial bleeding that sets up a wound healing cascade reaction. This causes the stimulation and enhancement of production of collagen and elastin. Apart from the production of new collagen, microneedling also results in the reorganisation of old collagen fibres. Production of these two proteins and organisation of older proteins result in making the skin firm and smooth.
Debunking Myths: What You Need to Know About Microneedling
Microneedling, a popular skincare treatment, is surrounded by various myths and misconceptions. Let's debunk some of the common myths:

The Benefits of Microneedling: Achieving Glowing and Smooth Skin
Microneedling, also known as collagen induction therapy, is a cosmetic procedure that involves pricking the skin with tiny sterilised needles that result in an increased production of collagen and elastin in the body, which heal your skin and help you look younger. Here are some of the key benefits of microneedling for skin:
Reduces Wrinkles and Fine Lines:
The production of collagen and elastin can help reduce wrinkles and fine lines. Over time, it can lead to skin that looks younger and more supple.
Improves Scars:
Microneedling is proven to diminish the look of surgery and acne scars. The process breaks down old tissue and triggers the production of new elastin and collagen for healthier skin.
Reduces the Appearance of Stretch Marks:
Although very challenging to treat, microneedling has been shown to reduce the appearance of stretch marks, especially when combined with other treatments.
Prevents Signs of Aging:
Regular microneedling can prevent new fine lines and wrinkles from forming. With its ability to stimulate the growth of collagen and elastin, it can effectively slow down the ageing process and keep the skin looking young.
Improves Skin Texture and Pore Size
:
By promoting collagen production, microneedling can lead to smoother skin and reduced pore size.
Enhances Product Absorption:
The tiny channels created by microneedling can help skincare products penetrate deeper into the skin, increasing their effectiveness.
Treats Pigmentation and Sun Damage:
Microneedling can also help reduce hyperpigmentation and sun spots, especially when combined with topical treatments.
Improves Rosacea Symptoms:
For those suffering from rosacea, which weakens the skin, microneedling can help thicken the skin by increasing collagen production, potentially reducing symptoms.
Reduces Acne
:
Some studies suggest that microneedling may help reduce acne by decreasing sebum production and making topical treatments more effective.
Glowing Results: How Microneedling Enhances Skincare Radiance
Microneedling enhances skincare radiance through several mechanisms, contributing to a healthier, more vibrant appearance of the skin. Here's how it works:
Stimulation of Collagen Production:
Microneedling prompts the skin to produce more collagen and elastin, the proteins responsible for skin strength and elasticity. This increase in collagen can help smooth fine lines and wrinkles, leading to a more youthful and radiant appearance.
Improved Skin Texture and Tone:
By triggering the skin's natural healing process, microneedling can improve skin texture and tone. This results in smoother, more even skin, which is often perceived as more radiant.
Enhanced Blood Flow:
The micro-injuries caused by the needles can increase blood flow to the area. Improved circulation brings more nutrients and oxygen to the skin, which can contribute to a natural glow.
As a result of this, a brighter and more radiant skin is unveiled.
Microneedling for Smoother Skin: Unveiling the Transformation
Microneedling is a powerful technique for enhancing skin smoothness. By creating tiny punctures in the skin, it boosts collagen and elastin production, leading to firmer, more youthful-looking skin. This process effectively diminishes fine lines, wrinkles, and scars, while also refining skin texture and pore size. It's like pressing a 'reset' button for your skin, rejuvenating it from within and enhancing the effectiveness of skincare products by improving their absorption. With a series of treatments, microneedling can unveil smoother, revitalised skin. Remember, it's crucial to have this treatment done by a professional to ensure safety and the best results.

always consult with a skincare professional
for personalised advice, especially when combining treatments like microneedling with your skincare regimen.
Professional vs. DIY Microneedling: Weighing the Options
Microneedling, a popular skincare technique, has gained significant traction in both professional clinics and DIY home-care routines. This process involves using tiny needles to create micro-injuries on the skin, stimulating natural healing processes and collagen production. While professional microneedling is performed by trained experts using advanced equipment, DIY microneedling relies on more accessible, user-operated devices.

Gentle Technique
:
Roll the device in one direction (vertical, horizontal, diagonal) without applying too much pressure. Avoid over-treating the skin by limiting it to a few passes over the same area.
Avoid Sensitive Areas:
Be cautious around sensitive areas like the eyes, lips, and any spots with active acne or wounds.
Hygiene Is Key:
Never share your microneedling device with others. Personal hygiene is crucial to avoid cross-contamination and infections.
Soothing Skincare Post-Treatment:
After microneedling, use a hyaluronic acid serum like
Clinikally Hyaluronic SkinBooster Serum
or a soothing and hydrating product to calm the skin. Avoid products with harsh ingredients like retinoids or acids immediately after treatment.
Sun Protection:
Your skin will be more sensitive to the sun after microneedling. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 such as
Clinikally SunProtect Sunscreen SPF 50/PA+++
.
Be Patient with Results:
Results from at-home microneedling are not immediate and are generally less dramatic compared to professional treatments. Consistent, safe use over time is key.
Know When to Stop:
If you experience severe pain, excessive redness, or signs of infection, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.
Stay Realistic:
Understand that at-home treatments are limited in their effectiveness, especially for deeper wrinkles, scars, or hyperpigmentation.
Educate Yourself:
Do thorough research or consult with a skincare professional to understand the process, potential risks, and aftercare.
Remember, while DIY microneedling can be a cost-effective alternative, the results and safety are not on par with professional treatments. If you have specific skin concerns or complex skin conditions, it's always better to seek treatment from a qualified skincare professional.
