<p><span>A natural sugar called trehalose is present in a wide variety of organisms, including plants, fungi, and some invertebrates. Its potential advantages for skin health and vitality have drawn attention recently. Trehalose has a special capacity to shield cells from oxidative damage, dehydration, heat, and other stressors. It's crucial to remember that while trehalose may promote healthy-looking skin, individual outcomes may differ. To maximise the effects of trehalose, a skincare routine can include moisturisers, serums, and masks that include the ingredient. Before incorporating new products into your routine, it is, however, always good to speak with a dermatologist or skincare expert, especially if you have any sensitivities or underlying skin concerns.</span></p>
<h2><b>Understanding Trehalose and Its Origin</b></h2>
<p><span>Trehalose is a disaccharide, which means it is made up of two sugar molecules, and it is found naturally. Numerous creatures, including plants, fungi, bacteria, and some invertebrates, contain it. The term "trehalose" comes from the substance called "trehala manna," which is produced by scale insects and was the original source from which trehalose was extracted.  Trehalose functions as a protective chemical and an essential energy source in nature. It enables organisms to endure extremely stressful situations, such as dehydration, high temperatures, and freezing. Trehalose protects and maintains the integrity of proteins and cellular structures by acting as a stabiliser.</span></p>
<p><span>In response to stresses including drought, salt, and low temperatures, plants synthesise trehalose. By preserving cellular water equilibrium and averting protein denaturation, it serves as a protective agent. Numerous plant sources, such as seeds, leaves, fruits, and fungi, contain trehalose. Trehalose is a reserve carbohydrate that fungi, particularly yeast, produce when there is a lack of nutrients or other stress. Fungi may endure adverse conditions thanks to trehalose and continue to thrive whenever favourable conditions are once again present. Additionally, it supports the defence mechanisms of fungal spores.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Science Behind Trehalose</b></h3>
<p><span>Trehalose has been extensively studied, and science is well-versed in its properties. The following are some fundamental concepts in the study of trehalose:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Chemical Structure</b><span>: A non-reducing disaccharide made up of two connected glucose molecules is trehalose. Trehalose contains a unique alpha-1,1-glycosidic bond between the glucose units, unlike other common disaccharides like sucrose or lactose. Trehalose's distinctive characteristics and advantages result from this structure.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydration and Water Retention</b><span>: Trehalose is well known for having a remarkable capacity to hold water. In order to surround proteins and cellular structures in a layer of safety, it establishes hydrogen bonds with water molecules. Due to this characteristic, trehalose can maintain the integrity and functionality of cells even in the face of acute stress or dehydration.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Protein Stabilisation</b><span>: By preventing protein denaturation, aggregation, and degradation, trehalose functions as a protein stabiliser. With proteins, it generates hydrogen bonds that preserve the structural integrity and functional integrity of the protein. This characteristic is crucial for maintaining the function of enzymes and other proteins even in severe conditions or under stress.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cellular Protection</b><span>: Trehalose helps shield cells from a variety of stressors, such as desiccation, oxidative damage, heat, and cold. By stabilising and avoiding damage to the components of cellular structures, including membranes and organelles, it aids in their maintenance. As an antioxidant, trehalose can scavenge free radicals and lessen oxidative stress in cells.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Anti-Aging Effects</b><span>: The preventive qualities of trehalose also include anti-aging and skin health benefits. It aids in fending off environmental stresses like UV radiation and pollution, which can hasten ageing and harm skin cells. Trehalose adds to a more youthful appearance and can help lessen the indications of ageing, such as wrinkles and fine lines, by maintaining cellular function and lowering oxidative stress.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skin Barrier Function</b><span>: Trehalose improves the skin's capacity to retain moisture while enhancing its natural <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/repair-skin-barrier-damage">barrier function</a>. It creates a shielding layer on the skin's surface that prevents transepidermal water loss and keeps the skin hydrated. People with dry or dehydrated skin, as well as those with delicate skin or weakened skin barriers, can all benefit from this.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Natural Sources of Trehalose</b></h3>

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Fungi</b><span>: It is known that fungi, including yeast, produce trehalose as a reserve carbohydrate during times of stress or nutrient scarcity. It helps fungi survive harsh conditions and grows when favourable conditions return. Trehalose is found in many fungi, including baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), mushrooms (such as shiitake and oyster mushrooms), and truffles.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Bacteria</b><span>: Some bacteria produce and store trehalose as a protective molecule. Examples include certain species of bacteria in the genus Deinococcus, which are known for their resistance to extreme radiation and desiccation. Trehalose enables these bacteria to withstand such harsh conditions.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
