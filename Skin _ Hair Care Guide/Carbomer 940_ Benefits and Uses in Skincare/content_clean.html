<p><span>In practice, Carbomer 940 is a polyvinyl carboxy polymer made from acrylic acid. The complex structure holds the key to its extraordinary powers. Cross-linking with pentaerythritol allyl ethers results in a high molecular weight polymer structure. This crosslinking is what gives Carbomer 940 its distinctive thickening and stabilising properties. Its principal usage is in cosmetic and medicinal formulations. Whether it's a skin <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hydrasoothe-moisturiser">moisturiser</a>, a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-gel">hair gel</a>, or an eye treatment, Carbomer 940 is likely to play an important part in maintaining product uniformity and effectiveness.</span></p>

<p><span>Carbomers are a class of synthetic polymers formed through the polymerization of acrylic acid. This method produces a distinctive white, fluffy powder known for its transformational qualities in cosmetic and personal care goods. When exposed to water, carbomers swell up to 1000 times their original size, producing a transparent, gel-like consistency that enhances the user experience. Carbomer's principal function is to enhance viscosity. It:</span></p>
