Carbomer 940 is a versatile component that is frequently used in skincare products due to its thickening, stabilising, and emulsifying qualities. This blog discusses Carbomer 940, its benefits, and how it is utilised in skincare formulas.
Understanding Carbomer 940: Exploring Its Role in Skincare Formulations
In practice, Carbomer 940 is a polyvinyl carboxy polymer made from acrylic acid. The complex structure holds the key to its extraordinary powers. Cross-linking with pentaerythritol allyl ethers results in a high molecular weight polymer structure. This crosslinking is what gives Carbomer 940 its distinctive thickening and stabilising properties. Its principal usage is in cosmetic and medicinal formulations. Whether it's a skin
moisturiser
, a
hair gel
, or an eye treatment, Carbomer 940 is likely to play an important part in maintaining product uniformity and effectiveness.
The Science Behind Carbomer 940: How It Enhances Skincare Products
Carbomers are a class of synthetic polymers formed through the polymerization of acrylic acid. This method produces a distinctive white, fluffy powder known for its transformational qualities in cosmetic and personal care goods. When exposed to water, carbomers swell up to 1000 times their original size, producing a transparent, gel-like consistency that enhances the user experience. Carbomer's principal function is to enhance viscosity. It:
Thickens, suspends, and stabilises cosmetic compositions.
Allows the introduction of substances with different solubility levels.
Enhances the overall texture and consistency of skincare products.
Makes
creams
and
lotions
feel more silky and enjoyable to use.
