<p><span>Several factors can contribute to increased <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-fall-hair-loss">hair loss</a> and dandruff during the summer.  Causes of summer hair loss include heat and humidity, dehydration, sun exposure, excessive washing, diet, and lifestyle.</span></p>
<h3><b>Causes of Hair Fall During Summer</b></h3>

<p><span>Summer hair loss can be caused by many factors, including the season's specific environmental and lifestyle conditions. Extreme heat, dehydration, sun exposure, excessive bathing, dietary and nutritional deficiencies, exposure to chlorine and salt water,  stress, environmental pollution, and hair care habits are the most common causes.</span></p>
<h3><b>Why Dandruff Worsens in Hot Weather</b></h3>

<p><span>Sweat evaporates slowly in humid conditions, causing bacteria, oil, dirt, and pollutants to accumulate. These can quickly accumulate on your head, reducing the scalp barrier, and resulting in <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/dandruff">dandruff</a>, which is more likely to occur in hot and humid weather.</span></p>
<h3><b>Impact of Summer Weather on Hair Health</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Impact of Summer Weather on Hair Health" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Impact_of_Summer_Weather_on_Hair_Health_480x480.jpg?v=1725868477"/></div>
<p><span>Summer weather including heat, humidity, sun exposure, and environmental factors, can have a significant impact on hair health. Here's how summer weather can impact your hair:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Exposure to the sun's UV rays can cause hair to become brittle and break easily.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Swimming in a pool or ocean can strip your hair of moisture, leaving it dry and brittle. Chlorine can also make your hair more porous, which can lead to hair damage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Excessive sweating during the summer can result in an <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/oily-scalp">oily scalp</a>, which can cause dandruff.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The scalp is frequently overlooked when applying <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-sunprotect-sunscreen-spf-50">sunscreen</a>, leaving it vulnerable to sunburn.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>UV rays can break down the chemical bonds in hair dye, causing color to fade, particularly for those with dyed or highlighted hair. These can also remove hair color, leaving it dull or brassy.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Sun exposure and a lack of moisture can weaken hair strands, increasing the risk of breakage and split ends.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>People often like to make tight buns or ponytails, but this puts pressure on the hair and they start breaking.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The body's natural reaction to the changing of the seasons can cause some people to experience increased hair shedding.</span></p>

</ul>
