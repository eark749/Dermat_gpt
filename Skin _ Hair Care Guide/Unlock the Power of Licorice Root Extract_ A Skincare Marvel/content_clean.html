<p><span>Glycyrrhizinate, also known as licorice root extract, is derived from the root of the Glycyrrhiza glabra plant. It is a natural ingredient that has been used in traditional medicine and skincare for centuries. Glycyrrhizinate is a compound found in licorice root extract that has several skin-beneficial properties. It is popular in skincare products due to its anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and antioxidant properties. Glycyrrhizinate, in addition to its anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties, has been shown to help regulate oil production in the skin, making it a popular ingredient in acne-prone skin skincare products. The skin-lightening abilities of glycyrrhizinate have also been proven, making it a well-liked ingredient in skincare products meant to lighten and even out skin tone. This is so that the appearance of dark spots and hyperpigmentation can be diminished by glycyrrhizinate's ability to inhibit the production of melanin in the skin.</span></p>

<h2><b>The 5 Remarkable Skincare Benefits of Licorice Root Extract</b></h2>

<p><span>Here are five remarkable skincare benefits of licorice root extract:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Reducing hyperpigmentation</b><span>: Skin-lightening properties of licorice root extract can help reduce hyperpigmentation and dark spots. It works by inhibiting the enzyme that produces melanin, the pigment that gives skin colour. This makes it an excellent ingredient for products aimed at reducing the appearance of age spots, sun spots, and other types of hyperpigmentation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Soothing irritated skin</b><span>: Licorice root extract has anti-inflammatory properties that make it an effective ingredient for soothing irritated and inflamed skin. It can help reduce redness and itching associated with conditions such as eczema and rosacea. It is also gentle enough to use on sensitive skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Moisturising the skin</b><span>: Glycyrrhizic acid, found in licorice root extract, has moisturising properties that can help keep the skin hydrated and supple. It can also aid in the prevention of moisture loss, making it an excellent ingredient for dry or dehydrated skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Protecting against UV damage</b><span>: Antioxidants found in licorice root extract can help protect the skin from UV damage. UV rays can cause free radical damage, which can lead to premature skin ageing. Licorice root extract can help prevent damage and keep the skin looking youthful and radiant by neutralising free radicals.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Treating acne</b><span>: Antimicrobial properties of licorice root extract can help prevent and treat acne. It can help reduce<a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/get-rid-of-acne-scars-and-blemishes"> acne-related inflammation</a> and prevent the growth of acne-causing bacteria. It's also gentle enough to use on sensitive skin, making it an excellent ingredient for acne-prone skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Calming Inflammation and Soothing Irritation</b></h3>
<p><span>Licorice root extract has been demonstrated to have strong anti-inflammatory properties, making it an important ingredient for reducing inflammation and soothing skin irritation.   It contains glycyrrhizic acid and flavonoids, both of which have been shown to reduce skin inflammation. Inflammation is the body's immune system's natural response to injury or infection, but chronic inflammation can lead to a variety of skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and rosacea. Licorice root extract can help reduce skin inflammation, which can help alleviate these conditions.</span></p>
<h3><b>Brightening the Skin and Reducing Hyperpigmentation</b></h3>
<p><span>Licorice root extract is a natural skin-lightening ingredient that has been used in traditional medicine for centuries to treat a variety of skin conditions, including hyperpigmentation. It contains glabridin, a compound that has been shown to inhibit melanin production in the skin. Melanin is the pigment that gives our skin, hair, and eyes their colour. Melanin overproduction can result in hyperpigmentation, which can cause an uneven skin tone, dark spots, and other types of discoloration. By preventing the production of melanin, licorice root extract can help to lessen hyperpigmentation and brighten the skin. Licorice root extract also contains other compounds that can help brighten the skin, in addition to glabridin, such as liquiritin and isoliquertin. These substances work by inhibiting the enzyme tyrosinase, which is involved in the synthesis of melanin.</span></p>
<h3><b>Protecting Skin with Antioxidant Properties</b></h3>
<p><span>Licorice root extract is a powerful antioxidant that can help protect the skin from free radical damage. Free radicals are unpredictable molecules that can be created by a number of things, including UV rays, pollution, and cigarette smoke. They can cause skin cell damage, resulting in premature ageing, fine lines, and wrinkles. Flavonoids, which are natural compounds with strong antioxidant properties, are found in licorice root extract. They function by neutralising free radicals and preventing them from damaging skin cells. Licorice root extract can help prevent the signs of ageing and keep the skin looking youthful and healthy by protecting it from oxidative stress. Licorice root extract has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may help reduce skin inflammation. This can help prevent the breakdown of collagen and elastin, which are important proteins that give the skin its structure and elasticity. Licorice root extract can aid in delaying the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines by protecting collagen and elastin.</span></p>
<h3><b>Balancing Oil Production and Treating Acne</b></h3>
<p><span>Since acne and healthy oil production are frequently linked, it can be challenging to maintain a healthy oil production cycle while treating acne. Here are some pointers that might be useful:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Use gentle and non-comedogenic skincare products</b><span>: Harsh skincare products can deplete the skin's natural oils, leading to increased oil production and acne. Look for non-comedogenic, gentle products that won't clog your pores.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid over-washing your face</b><span>: Over-washing your face can deplete your skin's natural oils, leading to increased oil production and acne. Use a gentle cleanser to wash your face twice a day.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use oil-free makeup and hair products</b><span>: Oil-based products can clog pores and contribute to acne. Look for oil-free makeup and hair products to help reduce the likelihood of breakouts.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consider using a topical retinoid</b><span>: Topical retinoids can help to regulate oil production and reduce acne. However, they can also be irritating to the skin, so it's important to start with a low concentration and gradually work your way up.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Try incorporating salicylic acid into your routine</b><span>: Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid that can help to unclog pores and reduce inflammation. It's often found in acne treatments and can be effective in managing both acne and oil production.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consider dietary changes</b><span>: Some studies suggest that diet may play a role in acne. Consider reducing your intake of dairy, sugar, and processed foods, and increasing your intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Strengthening the Skin Barrier</b></h3>
<p><span>A crucial part of the skin's protective function, the skin barrier helps with moisture retention, temperature control, and defence against environmental stressors. Use a mild cleanser, moisturise frequently, avoid over-exfoliating, protect your skin from environmental stressors, stay away from hot showers, and think about investing in a humidifier to strengthen your skin's protective barrier.  Remember that strengthening the skin barrier may take some time to see results, so be patient and consistent with your skincare routine. If you have persistent skin problems, consider consulting with a dermatologist for individualised advice.</span></p>
