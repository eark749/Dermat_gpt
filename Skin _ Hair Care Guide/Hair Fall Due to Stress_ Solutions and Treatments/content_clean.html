<p><span>Stress can significantly affect <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hair-regrow-serum%20">hair growth</a> by disrupting the growth cycle, affecting hormonal balance, limiting blood supply to the scalp, and increasing inflammation.

<p><span> High-stress levels have been linked to three types of hair loss:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Telogen effluvium occurs when considerable stress causes a large number of hair follicles to enter a resting phase. Within a few months, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/damaged-frizzy-hair">damaged hair</a> may come out unexpectedly when combing or washing your hair.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Trichotillomania is an uncontrollable impulse to remove hair from your scalp, brows, or other parts of your body. Hair pulling can be used to cope with negative or uncomfortable emotions such as stress, anxiety, loneliness, boredom, and irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/alopecia-areata">Alopecia areata</a> may be caused by a multitude of reasons, including acute stress. With alopecia areata, the immune system destroys the hair follicles, resulting in hair loss.</span></p>
