Skincare Experts Weigh In: The Benefits and Drawbacks of Trending Ingredients
Trendy substances for skincare frequently cause enthusiasm, but it's crucial to comprehend both their advantages and disadvantages. The benefits and drawbacks of some common trending substances are shown below:
Hyaluronic Acid
:
Pros
:
Excellent moisturising qualities because it draws and
holds moisture
in the skin.
Skin is plumped and made smoother, which makes wrinkles and fine lines less noticeable.
Can be used in a variety of formulations and is appropriate for different skin types.
Cons
:
Hyaluronic acid can remove moisture from the skin in low-humidity or dry environments, which could result in dryness.
Hyaluronic acid with a high molecular weight may rest on the skin's surface, providing superficial hydration but not lasting hydration.
Niacinamide
:
Pros
:
It is suitable for oily and
acne-prone skin
because it aids in controlling sebum production.
Improves the skin's barrier function, resulting in greater moisture retention.
Reduces redness, evens out skin tone, and minimises the appearance of pores.
Cons
:
Niacinamide is generally well tolerated, but some people may experience skin sensitivity or irritation. Patch testing is strongly advised.
Rare cases of flushing or a sensation of warmth may occur, especially at higher concentrations, but this usually goes away quickly.
Retinol
:
Pros
:
A gold standard ingredient for reducing the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and uneven skin texture.
Improves
skin elasticity
and firmness by stimulating collagen production.
Can help to reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation and acne scars.
Cons
:

:
Pros
:

Can aid in the brightening, evening, and fading of hyperpigmentation.
