By improving the function of these antioxidant enzymes, glutathione reinforces the body's antioxidant defence system and boosts immune resilience.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Glutathione is involved in detoxification processes, which help remove toxins, pollutants, and metabolic byproducts that can impair immune function. By supporting detoxification pathways in the liver and other organs, glutathione helps optimize immune health and resilience against environmental stressors.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Glutathione protects against infections by enhancing immune cells' ability to recognise and eliminate pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It helps immune cells involved in innate and adaptive immunity function properly, allowing for an effective immune response to invading pathogens.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Glutathione promotes immune system balance and tolerance, preventing excessive immune activation that can result in allergies, autoimmune diseases, or chronic inflammation. By modulating immune responses, glutathione promotes immune system balance and overall health.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Glutathione promotes immune resilience and adaptation to environmental challenges such as stress, infections, and toxins. It improves immune responses to changing conditions and increases overall immune system robustness and effectiveness.</span></p>
</li>
