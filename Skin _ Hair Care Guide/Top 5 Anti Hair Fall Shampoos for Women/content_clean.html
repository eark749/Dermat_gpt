<p><span>Humans typically lose 50-100 hairs every day. <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-fall-hair-loss">Hair loss</a> is a natural phenomenon in which some hair falls out, and some grows. If the balance is disrupted, hair loses due to hair falling out rather than increasing. The medical term for hair loss is "alopecia." Hair grows on practically all of your skin surfaces except the palms of your hands, soles of your feet, lips, and eyelids. Vellus hair is distinguished by its light, delicate texture and short length. Terminal hair grows thicker, darker, and longer.</span></p>

<h3><b>Proper Application Techniques</b></h3>

<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Wet your hair</b><span>: We're all aware of this, but when it comes to a hair loss shampoo, it's best not to take chances. When you dampen your hair before applying shampoo, ensure all portions of your hair are thoroughly moist. When you skip a step and only use shampoo, the excess concentrated in one location might dry out your hair and scalp.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Apply on your scalp and hair</b><span>: Use your hair to apply it to your shafts in a circular motion and lather up the rest of your hair. However, do not rub it through your hair lengths, as this might cause tearing. After you've rinsed off the shampoo, add a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/conditioners">conditioner</a> to repair your hair length.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Rinse thoroughly and ensure you’re squeaky clean</b><span>: We all hurry into this stage and commit the cardinal sin of not knowing how to use shampoo. Apply shampoo to all sides of the hair shafts and rinse them. Make sure to cover every surface to avoid dryness. Rub your scalp with your fingers to get a thorough cleansing.</span></p>
