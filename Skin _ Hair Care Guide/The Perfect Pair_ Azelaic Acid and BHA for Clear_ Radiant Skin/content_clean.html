<h2><b>Understanding Azelaic Acid and BHA: Benefits and Science</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="Can you use BHA and azelaic acid together?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Takeaway_Using_colloidal_oatmeal_for_supple_and_soft_skin_e266f5c7-0884-433d-9d95-47b6f1b849d7_480x480.png?v=1682918303"/></b></p>
<p><span>BHA and azelaic acid are two potent skincare components that support clear, bright skin. Here is a quick rundown of their advantages and how they function:</span></p>
<p><b>Azelaic acid</b><span>: This is a naturally occurring acid that is present in grains like rye, barley, and wheat. Acne, rosacea, and hyperpigmentation can all be effectively treated thanks to their antibacterial and anti-inflammatory characteristics. Additionally, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/benefits-of-azelaic-acid-for-skin">azelaic acid</a> aids in pore-clearing and skin exfoliation for a smoother, more radiant complexion.</span></p>
<p><b>BHA (beta hydroxy acid)</b><span>: A specific kind of exfoliating acid, it penetrates the skin's pores and dissolves the "glue" holding dead skin cells together. BHA can aid in pore-clearing and irritation reduction, which makes it particularly helpful for treating acne and blackheads.</span></p>
<p><span>Azelaic acid and BHA can support clear, beautiful skin when used in combination. BHA aids in pore cleaning and irritation reduction, while azelaic acid helps exfoliate and brighten the skin. These two substances working together can be very beneficial for treating acne-prone or clogged skin.</span></p>
<h3><b>What is Azelaic Acid and How it Benefits the Skin?</b></h3>
<p><span>Azelaic acid is a dicarboxylic acid that occurs naturally and is formed from cereals like wheat, barley, and rye. It has been used for many years to treat hyperpigmentation, rosacea, and acne. There are various advantages to azelaic acid for the skin, including:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Reducing inflammation</b><span>: The anti-inflammatory properties of azelaic acid contribute to the reduction of skin redness and swelling.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Fighting acne</b><span>: The antibacterial properties of azelaic acid can aid in the destruction of the bacteria that cause acne.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Exfoliating the skin</b><span>: Azelaic acid can aid in <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/sesderma-azelac-moisturizing-gel">exfoliating the skin</a> by clearing clogged pores and removing dead skin cells.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reducing hyperpigmentation</b><span>: Azelaic acid can help to reduce melanin production in the skin, resulting in less hyperpigmentation and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/dark-spots-causes-treatment">dark spots</a>. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Brightening the skin</b><span>: Azelaic acid can help brighten the skin, making it appear more radiant and youthful.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>What is BHA and How it Benefits the Skin?</b></h3>
<p><span>The chemical exfoliant known as BHA, or beta hydroxy acid, is frequently used in skincare products. Salicylic acid, which comes from willow bark, is the BHA that is used in skincare the most frequently. In order to remove sebum and dead skin cells that might block pores and cause acne and blackheads, BHA penetrates deeply into the skin's pores. Additionally, BHA contains anti-inflammatory qualities that may lessen skin inflammation and redness.</span></p>
<h3><b>Scientifically Proven Benefits of Azelaic Acid and BHA Combination</b></h3>
<p><span>Two active ingredients—azelaic acid and BHA—have been shown to improve the skin in complementary ways. It has been shown that azelaic acid has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects, making it useful for treating hyperpigmentation, rosacea, and acne. BHA, commonly referred to as salicylic acid, is a beta-hydroxy acid that effectively treats acne and blackheads by exfoliating the skin and clearing clogged pores.</span></p>
<p><span>Combining these components can help to cleanse and brighten the skin, lessen inflammation, and enhance the general texture of the skin. In one study, it was discovered that using a 10% azelaic acid and a 2% salicylic acid combination for 12 weeks reduced acne lesions and enhanced skin texture. Another study discovered that using 20% azelaic acid and 2% salicylic acid for 24 weeks reduced hyperpigmentation and enhanced skin tone. A variety of skin issues, including acne, rosacea, hyperpigmentation, and uneven skin texture, have been successfully treated using azelaic acid and BHA in combination.</span></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Acne</b><span>: Because of its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, azelaic acid is known to be effective against acne. BHA, on the other hand, has the ability to penetrate deep into the pores and exfoliate the skin, thereby reducing acne formation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hyperpigmentation</b><span>: By preventing the skin's melanin from being produced, azelaic acid can help to lessen the appearance of hyperpigmentation. By exfoliating and removing dead skin cells, BHA can also aid in balancing out skin tone.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Redness and inflammation</b><span>: Due to their anti-inflammatory properties, azelaic acid and BHA are both effective at reducing skin redness and inflammation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Clogged pores</b><span>: Azelaic acid works to keep germs and extra oil from blocking pores while BHA is helpful for clearing <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/open-clogged-pores">clogged pores</a>.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>You can address several skin issues at once and have a clearer, brighter, and more even complexion by mixing these two substances.</span></p>
<h3><b>Acne Prevention and Treatment with Azelaic Acid and BHA</b></h3>
<p><span>Azelaic acid and BHA work well together to get clear, glowing skin because they are both helpful in treating and preventing acne. Azelaic acid has been demonstrated to be helpful in lowering the development of acne-causing bacteria on the skin, in addition to reducing inflammation and sebum production, the greasy substance that can clog pores and cause acne breakouts. Azelaic acid can also aid in minimizing the look of acne scarring's post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). The exfoliant known as BHA, or beta-hydroxy acid, can get deep inside the pores to break down oil and clear them out. Lowering inflammation and redness aids in the prevention of new acne formation and can also enhance the appearance of existing acne. Azelaic acid and BHA work together to tackle various components of acne, resulting in clearer, younger-looking skin. While BHA is frequently used as a toner or spot treatment on troublesome areas, azelaic acid can be applied as a leave-on treatment to the entire face.</span></p>
<h3><b>Hyperpigmentation Reduction and Skin Brightening with Azelaic Acid and BHA</b></h3>
<p><span>Azelaic acid and BHA can also aid in lightening and reducing skin discoloration. Tyrosinase, an enzyme that produces melanin, is known to be inhibited by azelaic acid, which can result in hyperpigmentation. BHA can also aid in exfoliation and cell turnover, which can lessen the appearance of hyperpigmentation and encourage a more radiant complexion. These components work together to lessen the visibility of age spots, black spots, and other hyper-pigmented conditions. They can also encourage a more luminous complexion and help balance out skin tone.</span></p>
<h3><b>Skin Renewal and Anti-Aging with Azelaic Acid and BHA</b></h3>
<p><span>Also helpful for skin renewal and anti-aging are azelaic acid and BHA. It has been shown that azelaic acid stimulates collagen formation, which can improve the firmness and texture of the skin. BHA, on the other hand, can aid in exfoliation and enhance the appearance of the skin. Together, these components may aid in minimizing the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles, enhancing the tone and texture of the skin, and fostering a more youthful-looking complexion. Additionally, for people with sensitive skin or acne-prone skin, their anti-inflammatory characteristics can aid in reducing redness and inflammation.</span></p>
