Inflammation or skin damage can result in pigmented scars, commonly known as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). They can be caused by a variety of things, such as acne, wounds, burns, insect bites, and specific skin conditions, making them a major source of worry for many people. Scars with pigment can be efficiently treated by being aware of the reasons and available options. Melanin synthesis and inflammation are the causes of pigmented scars. There are several treatments for pigmented scars, including sunscreen use, topical medications, chemical peels, laser therapy, microneedling, and expert skincare. It's important to keep in mind that pigmented scars require time and effort to heal. The person and the type of scar may have an impact on the results. It may take several weeks or months before observable changes are visible, so patience is essential. Good skincare routines must also be followed, including moisturising, plucking or aggravating the scarred region, and gentle washing.
What are pigmented scars?
A type of skin darkening known as pigmented scars, often referred to as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), develops after inflammatory or traumatic damage to the skin. These scars are flat regions of darkened or discoloured skin that might be pink, red, brown, or even black in colour. They can affect anyone of any age or gender and are a typical cause of worry for people with different types of skin. Melanin, the pigment that gives us the colour of our skin, hair, and eyes, is overproduced in pigmented scars. When the skin is traumatised or inflamed by ailments like acne, wounds, burns, or other skin conditions, more melanin is produced. Scars are coloured because there is an excess of melanin in the affected area.
Definition of pigmented scars
Inflammation, injury, or trauma-related dark or discoloured patches on the skin are referred to as pigmented scars, also known as
post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH)
. An excessive amount of melanin, the pigment responsible for skin colour, is present in these scars. The affected skin becomes discoloured as a result of excessive melanin production, and this discoloration might be pink, red, brown, or even black in colour. Following numerous skin disorders or wounds, such as acne, cuts, burns, or other types of inflammation, pigmented scars are frequently seen. Pigmented scars do not change the texture or contour of the skin, in contrast to other forms of scars that may cause these changes. They can be visually visible and may take some time to naturally diminish, making them mostly a cosmetic concern.
Causes of Pigmented Scars
Various events that produce inflammation or stress on the skin can result in pigmented scars, also known as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). Increased melanin production causes the affected area to darken or discolour, which results in the development of pigmented scars. Following are some typical reasons for coloured scars:
Acne
: The skin may become inflamed and irritated as a result of
acne breakouts
. Acne lesions may leave behind coloured scars after they have healed. People with darker skin tones frequently have more of these scars.
Injuries
: Any type of skin injury or trauma, such as cuts, burns, or wounds, can result in the formation of pigmented scars as part of the skin's natural healing process.
Dermatitis
: Skin conditions such as
eczema
or allergic contact dermatitis can result in inflammation and pigmented scars in the affected areas.
Insect Bites
: Insect bites can cause an inflammatory response in the skin, resulting in pigmented scars.
Skin Infections
: Some skin infections, like bacterial or fungal infections, can result in inflammation and pigmented scars after the infection has cleared up.
Skin Treatments or Procedures
: If performed incorrectly or if the skin is not adequately protected while healing, certain aggressive skincare treatments or procedures, such as chemical peels, laser resurfacing, or dermabrasion, can result in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH)
A common skin disorder called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) is characterised by darker or discoloured patches that develop on the skin following an inflammatory or traumatic lesion. Increased melanin production as a result of inflammation, damage, or specific skin conditions causes it to happen. In relation to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, keep in mind the following:
Cause
: Melanin, the pigment responsible for the colour of our skin, hair, and eyes, is overproduced in PIH. Melanin production increases when the skin becomes inflamed or traumatised as a result of acne, cuts, burns, or other skin conditions. This excess melanin builds up in the affected area, resulting in the formation of dark or discoloured patches.
Appearance
: PIH typically manifests as flat, hyperpigmented patches that can be pink, red, brown, or even black in colour. The severity of the inflammation or injury as well as the person's skin tone can affect the colour of the PIH. PIH differs from true scars in that it does not result in permanent changes to the skin's texture or contour.
Common Triggers
: Acne, eczema, dermatitis, insect bites, cuts, burns, or skin treatments and procedures that cause inflammation can all cause PIH.
Duration
: The duration of PIH can vary among individuals. Most of the time, as the skin naturally renews itself, it gradually fades over time. The pigmented patches may, however, take several weeks to several months to lighten and meld with the surrounding skin. In some instances, PIH may last for a longer period of time, necessitating specialised treatments to help the discoloration fade.
Treatment
: PIH frequently gets better on its own with time, but there are medications that can hasten the fading process. Retinoids, vitamin C serums, chemical peels, and skin-lightening products like hydroquinone,
kojic acid
, and azelaic acid can all be used as topical treatments to lessen the appearance of PIH. The best course of treatment for your unique condition and skin type should be decided in consultation with a dermatologist or skincare expert.
Preventive action
: Taking proactive steps can reduce the likelihood of developing PIH. This includes refraining from picking at or squeezing pimples or other skin lesions, taking proper wound care measures, applying sunscreen with a high SPF, and limiting exposure to the sun.
Melasma
Brown or greyish patches on the face, notably on the cheeks, forehead, upper lip, and chin, are the hallmark of the widespread skin ailment melasma. It primarily affects women, though it can also impact men. Melasma's precise cause is unknown, but hormonal changes, sun exposure, and heredity are thought to have an impact on the condition. The following are some of the most important details regarding melanomas: their cause, symptoms, risk factors, triggers, management, and therapy.
Sun damage
Sun damage
is the term used to describe the negative effects that come from prolonged or excessive exposure to the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the skin. The sun emits various types of UV radiation, including UVA and UVB, which can be harmful to the skin. Sun damage causes sunburn, premature ageing, hyperpigmentation, skin cancer, and vision impairment.
It's essential to avoid sun damage to keep your skin healthy. Here are some precautions to take:
Apply broad-spectrum sunscreen liberally to all exposed skin, even on cloudy days, with an SPF of 30 or higher.
When the sun is most intense (typically between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.), seek shade.
Wear safety gear like long sleeves, wide-brimmed hats, and UV-protective sunglasses.
Avoid using sunlamps and tanning beds as they emit dangerous UV radiation.
Drink plenty of water to support the general health of your skin by staying hydrated.
Genetic factors
Our skin's look, structure, and sensitivity to particular skin disorders or concerns are all significantly influenced by genetic factors. The ageing process, skin disorders, skin type, look, and reaction to treatments are some major facts about genetic factors and how they affect the skin. While there are many aspects of our skin that are genetically determined, it's important to remember that lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and skincare routines all play a significant role in how healthy our skin stays. Regardless of genetic influences, a thorough skincare routine, sun protection, a balanced diet, and other excellent lifestyle decisions can help to improve the look and health of the skin.
Types of Pigmented Scars
There are various types of pigmented scars that can develop on the skin. Here are some examples of common types:
Post-inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH)
: This type of pigmented scar develops as a result of skin inflammation or injury. It can happen as a result of acne, insect bites, burns, cuts, or other traumatic skin events. PIH appears on the skin as darkened patches or spots, and the pigmentation can range from light brown to dark brown or even black. PIH usually fades with time, but it can take months or years to completely resolve.
Melasma
: A pigmentation disorder that typically affects the face and is characterised by brown or greyish patches of skin. It is more common in women, particularly during pregnancy (chloasma or "the mask of pregnancy") or as a result of hormonal changes caused by contraception or hormone replacement therapy. It is believed that both hormonal and sun exposure factors have an impact on melasma.
Post-inflammatory Erythema (PIE)
: Although technically not pigmented scars, PIE describes the red or purple discoloration that develops after skin inflammation or trauma. It happens as a result of the blood vessels in the affected area dilating. PIE is frequently observed after skin trauma or acne breakouts, and the redness may last for weeks or months.
Hypopigmentation
: When compared to the surrounding skin, hypopigmented areas of the skin appear lighter or have less pigment. It can develop as a side effect of certain treatments like laser therapy or chemical peels, or it can result from certain skin conditions like vitiligo or fungal infections.
Surgical or Traumatic Scars
: Pigmented areas can occasionally be found in scars that result from surgical procedures or traumatic injuries. Various factors, including skin type, the healing process, and sun exposure, can affect pigmentation, ranging from light to dark.
Atrophic scars
Atrophic scars are a particular kind of scar that appears as a result of tissue loss in the skin. Depressed or sunken spots on the skin's surface are what they are known for. Acne, chickenpox, or wounds involving the loss of underlying collagen or fat frequently result in atrophic scars. Atrophic scars can take a variety of forms, including:
Ice Pick Scars
: Ice pick scars are deep, slender, and resemble small punctures or holes in the skin. They typically result from severe acne and penetrate deeply into the layers of the skin.
Boxcar Scars
: Boxcar scars are more pronounced at the edges and are wider. They appear as shallow to moderately deep depressions with sharp, box-like edges on the skin's surface. Inflammatory acne frequently leaves behind boxcar scars.
Rolling Scars
: On the skin, rolling scars appear wavy or undulating. They have an uneven texture because the collagen fibres underneath have been damaged. The skin may look wave-like or like it has "rolling hills" as a result of rolling scars.
Hypertrophic Scars
: Although they are frequently connected to raised or elevated scars, hypertrophic scars can also have an atrophic component. The overproduction of collagen during the healing process of a wound causes hypertrophic scars, which can occasionally appear sunken or depressed in the middle.
The severity and type of the scar can influence the treatment options for atrophic scars. Some frequent remedies include:
Dermal Fillers
: To swell and fill in the hollowed-out areas of atrophic scars and give them a smoother appearance, injectable fillers can be used.
Microneedling
: A device with tiny needles is used to create controlled micro-injuries in the skin, stimulating collagen production and improving the appearance of atrophic scars.
Chemical Peels
: A chemical solution is applied to the skin, causing controlled exfoliation and stimulating collagen production, reducing the appearance of atrophic scars.
Laser Therapy
: Various laser treatments, such as fractional laser resurfacing, can help improve the appearance of atrophic scars by stimulating collagen production and promoting skin remodelling.
Hypertrophic scars
Raised scars, known as hypertrophic scars, develop as a result of aberrant skin healing mechanisms. Collagen, the protein in charge of giving the skin its structure and flexibility, is overproduced in certain conditions. Hypertrophic scars can be red, thick, and elevated, and they frequently stay inside the lines of the original wound.  For an accurate diagnosis and suitable treatment options for hypertrophic scars, speak with a dermatologist or other healthcare specialist. Based on the particulars of the scar and your unique scenario, they can offer tailored guidance.
Keloid scars
A particular kind of elevated scar that goes beyond the limits of the initial lesion is called a keloid scar. They develop as a result of excessive collagen production during the healing process, which thickens the scar tissue. In addition to being unsightly, keloids can occasionally be uncomfortable or itchy.  For an accurate diagnosis and the best course of action for treating keloid scars, speak with a dermatologist or other healthcare provider. Based on your unique situation, they can assess the scar's distinctive characteristics and suggest the best course of action.
Treating Pigmented Scars
The goal of treating pigmented scars is to lessen the appearance of darkening or discoloration in the scar tissue. Inflammation, trauma, or other skin diseases that interfere with the natural pigmentation process might result in scarring that is pigmented. The following are some potential treatments to take into account:
Topical creams or ointments with ingredients like hydroquinone, kojic acid, azelaic acid, or retinoids may help lighten pigmented scars. These creams work by reducing melanin production or encouraging skin exfoliation.
Chemical peels involve the application of a chemical solution to the skin in order to remove the top layers, thereby promoting cell turnover and revealing fresher, more evenly pigmented skin. Chemical peels can help to reduce the visibility of pigmented scars.
Microdermabrasion is a non-invasive procedure that uses tiny exfoliating crystals or a diamond-tipped wand to gently remove the skin's outer layer. It can help to reduce the visibility of scar pigmentation irregularities.
Intense pulsed light (IPL) and fractional laser resurfacing are two examples of laser therapies that can be used to treat pigmented scars. These lasers specifically target and break down melanin in the skin, resulting in a more even skin tone.
Cryotherapy can help lighten the colour of the pigmented scar by freezing it with liquid nitrogen. Some pigmented scar types, like those brought on by acne, are frequently treated with cryotherapy.
Sun protection is essential for preventing further darkening of the scar. Sunscreen with a high SPF should be applied to the scarred area on a daily basis, and protective clothing or accessories should be worn when out in the sun.
The pigmented scar can be temporarily hidden and made less noticeable by using specialised makeup items like colour correctors or concealers.
Topical treatments
Topical
scar treatments
are applied directly to the skin's surface. While they might not totally get rid of scars, they can at least help make them look better and encourage healthier skin. Following are some popular topical scar treatments:
Silicone gel or sheets
: Scars are frequently treated with silicone-based products, such as gels or sheets. They help to hydrate the skin, flatten the scar tissue, and lessen redness and discoloration by forming a shield over the scar.  The typical application time for silicone products is several hours per day for a considerable amount of time.
Medicated creams or ointments
: Scars can be treated with a variety of over-the-counter and prescription creams or ointments that are readily available. These topical treatments frequently contain corticosteroids, retinoids, vitamin E, or onion extract. They can aid in the softening and flattening of scars, the reduction of redness, and the improvement of overall skin texture. Before using any medicated creams or ointments, it is critical to follow the directions and consult a healthcare professional.
Scar gels and creams
: Scar gels and creams are specifically designed to target scars. These products typically contain a blend of moisturisers, vitamins, and botanical extracts aimed at improving the appearance of scars. Individual results may vary, but they can soften scar tissue, reduce itching, and improve the overall texture and colour of the scar.
Hydrogel dressings
: Hydrogel dressings are semi-transparent, gel-like sheets or dressings that can be applied to scars. They contribute to the preservation of a moist environment, which can promote healing and reduce the risk of infection. Hydrogel dressings are especially beneficial for new scars because they can help reduce pain, redness, and itching.
Sunscreen
: Scars must be protected from the sun to avoid further discoloration and hyperpigmentation.  Every time the scarred area is exposed to the sun, sunscreen with a high SPF (SPF 30 or higher) must be applied.  Look for sunscreens that offer broad-spectrum protection from UVA and UVB rays.
Massage therapy
: Massaging the scar with a gentle, circular motion on a regular basis can help break down scar tissue, increase blood circulation, and improve the scar's flexibility and appearance. It's important to use a non-irritating moisturiser or oil during the massage to prevent friction on the skin.
Chemical peels
Chemical peels are cosmetic procedures that apply a chemical solution to the skin in order to exfoliate the top layers of the skin in a controlled manner. By minimising fine lines, wrinkles, acne scars, hyperpigmentation, and other skin imperfections, this technique contributes to an improvement in the skin's appearance. It's important to keep in mind that many elements can affect the efficiency and results of chemical peels. It's crucial to heed the advice of a skincare expert, who can suggest the proper kind of chemical peel and offer individualised assistance based on your skin's state and goals.
Microdermabrasion
By gently removing the top layer of dead skin cells, microdermabrasion is a non-invasive cosmetic process that exfoliates and rejuvenates the skin. It involves manually exfoliating the skin with a tool that sprays tiny crystals or has a wand with a diamond tip. It is advised to speak with a physician or skincare expert to ascertain whether microdermabrasion is a good fit for your skin type, issues, and objectives. They can offer you individualised guidance, evaluate your skin's state, and advise you on the best course of action for the best outcomes.
Laser therapy
A cosmetic surgery called laser therapy, sometimes referred to as laser resurfacing or laser treatment, uses concentrated light beams to target and treat particular skin issues. Laser treatments can be precise and controlled by adjusting the laser energy to penetrate the skin at various depths. Numerous uses for laser therapy exist, including skin resurfacing, scar repair, hair removal, and the management of certain skin disorders. It's critical to remember that laser therapy is a medical practice with risks and potential side effects. It's essential to obtain professional advice, adhere to the suggested pre- and post-treatment care instructions, and communicate any worries or inquiries you may have with your healthcare practitioner.
Surgery
Surgery is a medical operation in which bodily tissues are physically changed or removed in order to cure, diagnose, or prevent a disorder. Several surgical techniques are frequently used in the context of cosmetic treatments to improve appearance or address particular aesthetic issues. The decision to undergo cosmetic surgery should only be made after serious thought, considerable research, and consultation with a licensed and skilled surgeon. They can offer you a thorough assessment and assist you in making decisions, ensuring your safety, and getting the right outcomes.
How to prevent pigmented scars
Precautions must be taken during the healing process of the wound to reduce the possibility of excessive pigmentation if pigmented scars are to be avoided. Here are some recommendations for avoiding coloured scars:
Protect the wound
: To prevent infection and reduce swelling, keep the wound clean and covered. You should take care of your wound according to your doctor's instructions, which may include keeping it clean, applying topical ointments or dressings as directed, and not picking or scratching the scab.
Avoid sun exposure
: Sunlight can cause hyperpigmentation, so shield the healing wound from it. Use sunscreen with a high SPF and broad-spectrum protection if the scar is in an area that can be exposed to the sun. When going outside in the sun, cover the scar with clothing or a bandage.
Reduce inflammation
: Inflammation can contribute to the formation of pigmented scars.  To reduce inflammation, follow your healthcare provider's wound care recommendations, which may include using ice packs or anti-inflammatory medications as directed.
Gentle massage
: Gently massaging the incision after it has healed and is no longer open or scabbed can assist to increase blood circulation and lessen the production of scar tissue. Apply a mild moisturiser or scar-reducing cream, massage the scar in circular motions, and keep your pressure light. For more detailed advice, speak with your dermatologist or medical professional.
Consider silicone sheets or gels
: It has been demonstrated that silicone sheets or gels can aid in preventing hyperpigmentation and other aberrant scar formation. They assist maintain a healing-friendly environment by forming a shield over the scar. For proper use, according to the manufacturer's instructions or speak with your healthcare professional.
Maintain a healthy lifestyle
: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help with wound healing and skin health. Eat a well-balanced, nutrient-dense diet, stay hydrated, and avoid smoking, which can impede healing and increase the risk of complications.
Seek professional advice
: Consult a dermatologist or other healthcare professional if you are worried about pigmented scars or you are at risk of getting them. They can offer you individualised guidance and suggest particular therapies or interventions based on your needs.
When to see a dermatologist
If you have any of the following symptoms, you should see a dermatologist, who is a medical specialist in skin care:
Skin Conditions
: If you have a persistent or worsening skin condition, such as acne, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, or a rash that does not improve with over-the-counter treatments, you should see a dermatologist.  They can accurately diagnose the condition and offer appropriate treatment options.
Skin Infections
: If you suspect a skin infection, such as cellulitis, impetigo, or a fungal infection, seek medical attention immediately.  Dermatologists can recommend the right drugs, like antibiotics or antifungal agents, to effectively treat the infection.
Suspicious Moles or Skin Growths
: It's important to have any suspicious moles or skin growths examined by a dermatologist as soon as you notice any new or changing moles.  The moles or growths can be evaluated, and they can decide whether additional testing, such as a biopsy, is required to rule out skin cancer or other serious conditions.
Hair and Nail Concerns
: Dermatologists can also address hair and nail concerns. If you are experiencing hair loss, scalp conditions, or abnormalities with your nails, a dermatologist can evaluate the underlying cause and provide appropriate treatment options.
Cosmetic Concerns
: If you have cosmetic concerns, such as signs of aging, pigmentation issues, or unwanted hair, a dermatologist can provide you with treatment options that are tailored to your specific needs. When necessary, they can offer expert counsel and carry out procedures like cosmetic surgery, laser treatments, or injectables.
Allergic Reactions
: It is advised to seek medical attention right away if you experience a severe or ongoing allergic reaction that affects your skin and causes hives, itching, swelling, or a rash.  A dermatologist can pinpoint the causes of your symptoms and administer the proper care.
Skin cancer screening
: Regular skin cancer screenings are crucial, particularly if you have a history of sun exposure, a family history of skin cancer, or a lot of moles. A dermatologist can thoroughly examine your skin, identify any suspicious lesions, and, if necessary, advise further testing or treatment.
Natural remedies for pigmented scars
Natural treatments can help enhance the appearance of pigmented scars and support healthy skin, even though they might not fully remove them. Here are some possible helpful natural remedies:
Lemon juice
: Lemon juice's strong vitamin C level gives it natural bleaching powers. Applying freshly squeezed lemon juice to scars with pigment may eventually help them become less noticeable. Apply the lemon juice to the scar with a cotton ball after diluting it with equal parts water. Before rinsing it off, let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes. However, some people may have skin irritation from lemon juice, so it's vital to conduct a patch test and stop use if any negative responses happen.
Aloe vera
: Aloe vera's calming and moisturising qualities can aid in reducing inflammation and fostering healing. Pure aloe vera gel should be directly applied to the scar that has pigment and left on for 30 minutes before being rinsed off. Repeat this process twice daily. Look for 100% pure aloe vera gel or extract from a reputable source.
Coconut oil
: Coconut oil has fatty acids that hydrate and nourish the skin, which may help pigmented scars look less noticeable. Every day, gently massage extra virgin coconut oil in circular motions onto the scarred area. After letting it sit all night, rinse it off in the morning.  Using coconut oil may not be effective for all people, so pay attention to how your skin reacts and stop using it if it becomes irritated.
Rosehip seed oil
: Rosehip seed oil may assist to balance out skin tone and minimise the visibility of scars caused by pigment by containing considerable amounts of antioxidants, vital fatty acids, and vitamin A. A few drops of pure rosehip seed oil should be administered, and then the scarred region should be gently rubbed. The next morning, rinse it off after letting it sit all night. Repeat this process every day.
Honey
: Honey has natural moisturising and antibacterial qualities that can speed up healing and possibly lessen the visibility of pigmented scars. Apply raw, organic honey to the scarred area and leave it on for 15-20 minutes before rinsing it off. Repeat this process several times a week.
Turmeric
: Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant qualities of turmeric may aid in the fading of pigmented scars. Apply a paste to the scarred region by combining turmeric powder with water or rose water. Before rinsing it off, let it sit for 15 to 20 minutes. Perform a patch test before using turmeric as it may temporarily colour the skin.
Common misconceptions about pigmented scars
There are several common misconceptions about pigmented scars that are important to address. These misconceptions can lead to misunderstandings and incorrect treatment approaches. Here are a few of these misconceptions:
Scars that have been pigmented will fade on their own
: It is possible for some pigmented scars to fade over time, although this is not always the case. Individual differences in the natural healing process of scars can cause some to last longer than others. To improve the appearance of pigmented scars, active intervention may be required, such as the use of suitable creams and therapies.
Sun exposure will help lighten pigmented scars
: This is a common misconception, but it is not true.  Sun exposure can aggravate and darken pigmented scars. UV radiation from the sun stimulates melanocytes (pigment-producing cells), which can result in scar hyperpigmentation.  Sun protection and the use of sunscreen are critical for minimising pigmentation.
Scrubbing or exfoliating will remove pigmented scars
: Excessive rubbing or rough exfoliation might irritate the skin and possibly make pigmented scars appear worse. It's crucial to be kind to the scarred region and to refrain from using abrasive cleaners or severe cleaning. For proper exfoliating techniques or treatments made especially for skin with scars, consult a dermatologist.
Only topical treatments can reduce pigmented scars
: Although topical treatments can help to lessen the visibility of pigmented scars, they might not be enough to significantly reduce scar size. Other treatment modalities, such as laser therapy, microdermabrasion, or chemical peels, might be required depending on the type and severity of the pigmented scar. A dermatologist's advice can help you choose the best course of action for your particular scar.
It is possible to completely remove all pigmented scars
: It's important to have reasonable expectations even though various treatments can help pigmented scars look better. It might not always be possible to completely remove pigmented scars.  The purpose of treatment is to achieve an even skin tone, reduce the scar's visibility, and improve its texture.  A healthcare professional should be consulted for a customised assessment and treatment plan because each scar and person's response to treatment are different.
Importance of sunscreen for pigmented scars
For many reasons, sun protection is crucial for people with pigmented scars.
Preventing Darkening
: Sun exposure can cause hyperpigmentation, which increases the visibility of pigmented scars. UV rays have the ability to stimulate melanocytes, the skin's pigment-producing cells, increasing melanin production and darkening scars. Applying sunscreen helps to create a barrier that hinders damaging UV rays from penetrating scarred skin, lowering the possibility of hyperpigmentation.
Minimising Inflammation
: Sun exposure can cause skin inflammation, which may slow healing and conceivably make pigmented scars more noticeable. Scars on inflamed skin may turn darker or redder and are more prone to discoloration. Sunscreen shields the scarred skin from UV-induced inflammation, facilitating a faster healing process.
Promoting Scar Healing
: UV radiation can impede the natural healing of scars, possibly resulting in the formation of abnormal scars. Sunscreen shields the sun-damaged skin from its harmful rays, allowing the scar to heal properly. This can result in a more favourable outcome, with improved texture and colour of the scar over time.
Maintaining Treatment Results
: Consistent sunscreen use is essential if you're undergoing procedures to lighten or reduce pigmented scars, such as chemical peels, laser therapy, or topical treatments. These procedures may increase the skin's sensitivity to the sun, and unprotected sun exposure can undo any reduction in pigmentation that has already taken place.
Lifestyle changes to improve pigmented scars
While modifying one's lifestyle may not completely get rid of pigmented scars, it can help the skin as a whole, speed up the healing process, and possibly even make scars seem better. Here are some lifestyle adjustments that might be advantageous:
Healthy Eating
: Eating a balanced diet full of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids can promote optimum skin health. Your diet should contain lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. These nutrients can support wound healing, improve skin tone and texture, and encourage the production of collagen.
Hydration
: For the purpose of maintaining healthy skin, proper hydration is crucial. Drink enough water each day to keep your skin hydrated from the inside out. The appearance of pigmented scars can be reduced because hydrated skin is more supple.
Smoking cessation
: If you smoke, it's strongly advised that you stop for a variety of health benefits, including your skin. Smoking can slow the healing process and reduce blood flow to the skin, which may make pigmented scars appear more prominent. Consult with a healthcare professional or seek support to quit smoking.
Sun Protection
: Scar care depends on shielding your skin from the sun's harmful UV radiation. As was previously noted, sun exposure can cause hyperpigmentation and exacerbate the look of scars. Wear protective clothing, such as long sleeves and wide-brimmed hats, and cover exposed skin, particularly pigmented scars, with sunscreen with a high SPF. When feasible, seek shade, especially when the sun is most intense.
Stress management
: Prolonged stress can harm your overall health, including your skin. Stress may hinder skin repair processes and slow down wound healing. Use stress-reduction strategies like regular exercise, mindfulness, meditation, deep breathing, and enjoyment of your favourite activities. Finding productive ways to deal with stress can indirectly improve scar healing and skin health in general.
Gentle Skincare
: Use gentle care on your skin, especially where pigmented scars are concerned. Avoid using harsh scrubbers or abrasive skincare products because they can irritate the skin and possibly make scars more noticeable. Use gentle skincare products, moisturisers, and cleansers that are appropriate for your skin type.  Consult a dermatologist for advice that is tailored specifically to your scarred skin.
Consistency and Patience
: It takes time and routine maintenance to improve the appearance of pigmented scars.  Maintain a consistent skincare regimen, heed medical professionals' recommendations, and exercise patience as the wound heals. It's important to control your expectations and realise that scars may not always be completely gone. Focus on overall skin health and achieving the best possible outcome for your scars.
Home care for pigmented scars
Home care for pigmented scars can support professional care and speed up the healing process. Here are some suggestions for at-home care that could help pigmented scars look better:
Gentle Cleaning
: Use a mild, non-irritating cleanser to gently clean the scarred area. Avoid using abrasive soaps or cleansers that might strip the skin of its natural oils and make scars appear worse.  Use a soft washcloth or your fingertips to gently clean the area, and then thoroughly rinse with warm water.
Moisturization
: Maintain moisture in the scarred area to help heal the wound and improve the skin's texture. For your skin type, pick a mild, fragrance-free moisturiser. Use gentle, upward motions to apply the moisturiser to the scarred area. Moisturising frequently can aid in softening the scar tissue and enhancing the scar's overall appearance.
Silicone Gel or Sheets
: Take into account using silicone-based items, like silicone gel or sheets, which have been demonstrated to lessen the visibility of scars. These products help keep the scar moist, form a protective barrier over it, and may eventually help the scar become less red and flatter. Follow the product instructions for application and duration of use.
Massage:
By gently massaging the scarred area, you can break up scar tissue and encourage blood flow. Apply light pressure while moving in circular motions with clean hands or a soft massage tool.  This may help the scar become softer and even enhance its appearance. However, avoid massaging open wounds or fresh scars to prevent further damage.
Sun Protection
: To avoid darkening and worsening pigmentation, it's important to keep pigmented scars out of the sun. Even on overcast days, cover the scarred area with a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF before venturing outside. Every two hours, reapply sunscreen, and whenever possible, find shade.
Avoid Picking or Scratching
: Refrain from picking or scratching the scarred area because doing so can delay healing and possibly cause more scarring or hyperpigmentation. Avoid aggressive behaviour that could harm the skin by keeping your hands away from the scar.
Patience and Consistency
: Treating pigmented scars takes time and consistency. The severity, type, and individual factors of the scar may all influence the outcome. Maintain a consistent home care routine and be patient. It may take several weeks or months for the scar's appearance to improve noticeably.
Risks and side effects of pigmented scar treatments
Professional or at-home treatments for pigmented scars may come with some dangers and negative effects. Before beginning any particular treatment, it's crucial to be aware of these possible side effects and discuss them with a dermatologist or other healthcare provider. The followings are some common dangers and adverse reactions related to pigmented scar treatments:
Skin Sensitivity and Irritation
: Some treatments, including topical creams or gels, chemical peels, and exfoliating agents, can make the skin irritated and sensitive. If the procedure is too harsh or if you have sensitive skin, this is more likely to happen.  Before using any new product in a larger area, it's crucial to carefully read the directions and carry out a patch test.
Hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation
: Pigmented scar treatments can cause changes in skin pigmentation in some cases. Hyperpigmentation is an increase in skin colour that causes darker patches or spots, whereas hypopigmentation is a decrease in skin colour that causes lighter patches. These pigmentary changes can occur as a result of incorrect treatment techniques, overtreatment, or individual skin reactions.
Allergic Reactions
: Some people may experience allergic reactions to certain treatment products or ingredients. Symptoms may include redness, swelling, itching, rash, or hives. It's important to carefully read ingredient labels and stop using anything if you notice any symptoms of an allergic reaction.  If necessary, seek the advice of a healthcare professional for the best course of action.
Skin Dryness or Peeling
: Some therapies, like chemical peels or exfoliating substances, can make the skin temporarily dry, flaky, or peel. This is a common side effect of treatment and can be managed with moisturisers and gentle skincare. However, if the dryness or peeling is severe or persistent, it is critical to seek medical attention.
Infection or scarring
: Invasive treatments, such as laser therapy or surgical procedures, pose a minor risk of infection or scarring. Following proper post-treatment care instructions, keeping the treated area clean, and seeking medical attention if you notice signs of infection, such as increased redness, pain, swelling, or pus, is critical.
Sun Sensitivity
: Certain treatments can make the skin more sun sensitive.  By wearing sunscreen, looking for shade, and taking the necessary sun protection precautions, you can prevent the treated area from being overexposed to the sun. Lack of sun protection can cause skin damage, increased pigmentation, or a delay in healing.
A dermatologist or other healthcare provider should be consulted so they can assess your particular scar and make tailored recommendations. They can advise you on the possible drawbacks and risks of various therapies, evaluate the suitability of your skin for particular interventions, and help you decide which course of action is best for your pigmented scars.
