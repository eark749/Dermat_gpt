Aloe vera is a plant that has been used for centuries for its medicinal and therapeutic properties. It is commonly known for its benefits in treating sunburns and other skin irritations. However, aloe vera has a wide range of benefits that go beyond just treating burns. It is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that can help improve the overall health of your skin and hair. In this blog, we will explore the benefits of aloe vera for skin and hair, how to use it in your daily routine, and some tips for getting the most out of this amazing plant.
What is aloe vera?
Aloe vera is a succulent plant that belongs to the family of Asphodelaceae. It is native to North Africa, but now grows in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that contain a gel-like substance. This gel is commonly used in various cosmetic and medicinal products due to its numerous health benefits. Before trying any new skin care product for any skin concern it's always best to
consult a dermatologist
who can provide personalized recommendations based on your underlying condition.
The science behind Aloe Vera's healing properties
Aloe vera has been used for centuries for its purported healing properties, and recent scientific research has shed light on some of the mechanisms that underpin its effectiveness. Here are some important aspects of the science behind aloe vera's healing properties.
Aloe vera contains compounds with anti-inflammatory properties, including bradykinase,
salicylic acid
, and auxins. These compounds help to reduce inflammation by inhibiting the activity of enzymes involved in the inflammatory process.
Aloe vera gel contains polysaccharides like acemannan, which promote skin regeneration and wound healing. These polysaccharides stimulate the growth of fibroblasts, which are cells that produce
collagen
, the primary structural protein in the skin.
Aloe vera gel is high in water content and contains mucopolysaccharides, which help the skin retain moisture. This moisturising effect can help to relieve dry and irritated skin while also promoting healing.
Aloe vera contains anthraquinones and phenolic compounds with antimicrobial properties. These compounds can inhibit the growth of bacteria, fungi, and viruses, making aloe vera effective in treating minor skin infections and hastening wound healing.
Aloe vera is rich in
antioxidants
such as vitamins A, C, and E, as well as flavonoids and polyphenols. These antioxidants help to neutralise free radicals, which can damage cells and accelerate the ageing process. By reducing oxidative stress, aloe vera may help maintain skin health and promote healing.
Aloe vera contains compounds with analgesic properties, such as glycoproteins, that can help relieve pain and discomfort caused by wounds, burns, and inflammation.
Aloe vera gel contains compounds that promote collagen synthesis, a protein essential for maintaining skin elasticity and strength. This can help repair damaged skin and prevent scarring.
According to some studies, aloe vera may have mild sun-blocking properties, protecting from UV radiation. However, it should not be used as a replacement for
sunscreen
, but rather as an additional measure to promote skin health.
Aloe Vera anti-inflammatory properties
Aloe vera's anti-inflammatory properties are primarily due to its high content of bioactive compounds such as polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and enzymes. Here's how these ingredients contribute to its anti-inflammatory properties:
Polysaccharides
: Aloe vera contains complex carbohydrates called polysaccharides, which include acemannan. These polysaccharides have been shown to inhibit the activity of pro-inflammatory enzymes like COX and LOX. By inhibiting these enzymes, aloe vera helps to reduce the production of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which are involved in the inflammatory response.
Glycoproteins
: Aloe vera gel contains glycoproteins like aloctin A and B, which have anti-inflammatory properties. These glycoproteins work by inhibiting the release of histamine, a compound that causes allergic reactions and inflammation. By reducing histamine levels, aloe vera can help alleviate inflammation and associated symptoms like redness and swelling.
Enzymes
: Aloe vera contains several enzymes, including bradykinase, which has anti-inflammatory properties. Bradykinase breaks down bradykinin, a pro-inflammatory molecule that causes pain and swelling. By degrading bradykinin, aloe vera reduces inflammation and promotes tissue healing.
Antioxidants
: Chronic inflammation is often associated with oxidative stress, which can exacerbate tissue damage. Aloe vera contains antioxidants like vitamins A, C, and E, as well as flavonoids and polyphenols, which help neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress. By combating oxidative damage, aloe vera helps mitigate inflammation and support tissue repair.
Hydration and Cooling Effects
: Aloe vera gel has a high water content and a cooling sensation when applied topically. This
hydration
and cooling effect can help soothe inflamed skin and provide symptomatic relief for conditions like sunburn,
eczema
, and
dermatitis
.
Aloe Vera juice for digestive health
Aloe vera juice is frequently advertised as having digestive health benefits. Here's how it may promote digestive health:
Soothing Irritation
: Aloe vera contains anti-inflammatory and soothing compounds such as polysaccharides and glycoproteins. When consumed, aloe vera juice may help alleviate irritation and inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, which can be beneficial for conditions like acid reflux, gastritis, and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).
Promoting Healing
: Polysaccharides in aloe vera juice, such as acemannan, have been shown to stimulate collagen production and tissue repair. This is especially useful for people who have gastrointestinal conditions that cause damage to the digestive tract's lining, such as ulcers or colitis.
Balancing Gut Flora
: Aloe vera contains prebiotic compounds like fructans, which feed beneficial bacteria in your gut. By promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria, aloe vera juice may help maintain a healthy balance of gut flora, which is essential for proper digestion and immune function.
Supporting Digestive Regularity
: Anthraquinones, which include aloin and barbaloin, are responsible for the laxative effects of aloe vera juice. These substances can stimulate bowel movements and increase intestinal motility, which may be beneficial for those who experience occasional constipation. However, to prevent any negative effects like diarrhoea or electrolyte imbalances, aloe vera juice must be used carefully and moderately for this purpose.
Relieving Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Symptoms
: Aloe vera juice has been reported by some IBS sufferers to alleviate symptoms. While more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying this effect, it is believed that aloe vera's anti-inflammatory and soothing properties may help calm intestinal irritation and relieve symptoms such as abdominal pain and bloating.
Supporting Detoxification
: Because of its purported ability to support liver function and promote toxin elimination from the body, aloe vera juice is occasionally included in detoxification or cleansing regimens. However, scientific evidence supporting these claims is limited, and caution should be exercised when using aloe vera juice for detoxification, as excessive consumption may have negative consequences.
It is important to note that, while aloe vera juice may have digestive health benefits, individual responses can vary, and some people may experience side effects like abdominal cramping, diarrhoea, or allergic reactions. Furthermore, aloe vera juice should be consumed in moderation and under the supervision of a healthcare professional, particularly for people who have pre-existing digestive conditions or are taking medications, because it may interact with certain drugs.
