Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can affect various areas of the body, including the scalp. It can cause redness, scaling, and itching, and can be frustrating to manage. Here are some ways to get rid of seborrheic dermatitis on the scalp:
Use medicated shampoos
: There are several shampoos available over the counter that can help to reduce the symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis. Look for products containing ingredients such as ketoconazole, selenium sulfide, or
pyrithione zinc
. Use the shampoo as directed on the label, and leave it on the scalp for a few minutes before rinsing it off.
Apply topical treatments
: In addition to medicated shampoos, there are also topical treatments available that can be applied directly to the affected areas of the scalp. These may include corticosteroid creams, antifungal creams, or calcineurin inhibitors. Your dermatologist can recommend the best treatment for your individual case.
Practice good scalp hygiene
: It's important to keep the scalp clean and free of excess oil and build-up. Wash your hair regularly with a gentle, non-irritating shampoo, and avoid using
hot water
, as this can worsen symptoms. Also, avoid using hair products that can clog the pores on the scalp, such as oils and gels.
Manage stress
: Stress can exacerbate
seborrheic dermatitis
, so it's important to find ways to manage stress levels. This may include practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, getting regular exercise, or talking to a mental health professional.
Avoid triggers
: Certain factors can trigger or worsen seborrheic dermatitis on the scalp. These may include cold, dry weather, harsh shampoos or hair products, and certain medical conditions. Identify your triggers and take steps to avoid them.
It's important to note that seborrheic dermatitis on the scalp can be a chronic condition that may require ongoing treatment. If you're experiencing symptoms that are not responding to home remedies or over-the-counter treatments, consult with a dermatologist for further evaluation and management.
What is Seborrheic Dermatitis
Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin condition that causes redness, itching, flaking, and sometimes greasy patches on the skin. It most commonly affects the scalp, face, and chest, but can also occur in other parts of the body.
The exact cause of
seborrheic dermatitis
is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to a combination of factors, including genetics, environmental factors, and the overgrowth of a type of yeast called
Malassezia
on the skin.
Seborrheic dermatitis is not contagious and can be managed with various treatments, such as medicated shampoos, topical creams, and lifestyle modifications. However, it can be a chronic condition that requires ongoing management. If you suspect that you have seborrheic dermatitis, it is recommended to see a dermatologist for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.
Causes of Seborrheic Dermatitis
Seborrheic dermatitis
is a chronic skin condition that causes red, scaly, and itchy patches on the scalp, face, ears, chest, and other oily areas of the body. The exact causes of seborrheic dermatitis are not fully understood, but several factors may contribute to its development:
Malassezia yeast
: A type of yeast that is commonly found on the skin can overgrow and cause inflammation and scaling in people with seborrheic dermatitis.
Hormones
: Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during puberty or pregnancy, may contribute to the development of seborrheic dermatitis.
Genetics
: Seborrheic dermatitis may run in families, suggesting that there may be a genetic component to the condition.
Stress
: Stress and emotional factors can trigger or worsen seborrheic dermatitis.
Weather conditions
: Dry and cold weather can cause the skin to become dry and flaky, which may trigger or worsen seborrheic dermatitis.
Certain medical conditions
: Seborrheic dermatitis is more common in people with certain medical conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, HIV/AIDS, and epilepsy.
Certain medications
: Some medications, such as lithium, interferon, and some anti-seizure medications, may increase the risk of developing seborrheic dermatitis.
Improper skin care
: Using harsh soaps, shampoos, or skin care products that strip the skin of its natural oils can also contribute to the development of seborrheic dermatitis.
While the exact cause of seborrhoeic dermatitis is unknown, it is most likely the result of a combination of genetic, environmental, hormonal, and immune factors. Understanding these potential triggers can help people manage their symptoms and flare-ups more effectively. If you suspect you have seborrhoeic dermatitis, see a dermatologist for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.

Seborrheic Dermatitis and Dandruff
Seborrheic dermatitis and
dandruff
are two conditions that affect the scalp and are often confused with each other due to their similar symptoms. However, they are different in terms of their severity, underlying causes, and treatment options.
Dandruff is a common condition that causes white flakes to appear on the scalp and hair. It is caused by an overgrowth of yeast on the scalp, which leads to irritation and inflammation. Dandruff can be mild or severe, and it is often treated with over-the-counter shampoos that contain antifungal agents or ingredients that help to reduce inflammation and flaking.
Seborrheic dermatitis is a more severe form of dandruff that can affect other areas of the body, such as the face, chest, and back. It is caused by an overgrowth of a type of yeast called Malassezia, as well as an overproduction of oil on the skin. Seborrheic dermatitis can be a chronic condition and may require prescription medications such as topical corticosteroids or antifungal agents to manage symptoms.
Both dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis can be managed with proper scalp hygiene, such as washing the hair regularly with gentle shampoos and avoiding harsh chemicals or styling products. It is also important to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle to support overall skin health. If symptoms persist or become severe, it is best to
consult a
dermatologist
for proper diagnosis and treatment.

While there's no cure for seborrheic dermatitis, several natural remedies can help manage symptoms and reduce flare-ups. Here are some options to consider:
Tea Tree Oil

Dilute tea tree oil with a carrier oil (such as coconut oil or jojoba oil) and apply to affected areas, leaving it on for a few minutes before rinsing off.
Coconut Oil
: Rich in lipids and possessing antimicrobial qualities, coconut oil helps to calm irritated skin and inhibit the growth of fungi. After putting on organic, virgin coconut oil and letting it sit for a few hours or overnight, wash it off.

Apple Cider Vinegar

Probiotics
: Probiotics have the potential to lessen inflammation and help the gut microbiome rebalance, which may help with seborrhoeic dermatitis symptoms. Include foods high in probiotics, like kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, and yoghurt, in your diet.
Healthy Diet
: Consuming a well-balanced diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats can help to lower inflammation and promote general skin health. Avoiding trigger foods like sugar, processed foods, and dairy products may also help to alleviate flare-ups.
Before trying any new remedies, you should consult with a healthcare professional or dermatologist, especially if your symptoms are severe or persistent. They can make personalised recommendations based on your condition and medical history.
Lifestyle Changes to Manage Seborrheic Dermatitis
Seborrhoeic dermatitis is frequently managed through a combination of skincare routines, lifestyle changes, and, in some cases, medical treatments. Here are some lifestyle changes that can help with seborrhoeic dermatitis:
Keep Skin Clean and Moisturized
: Use a gentle cleanser on your face and affected areas on a regular basis to remove excess oil, dirt, and dead skin cells. Apply a
moisturiser
afterward to keep the skin hydrated and prevent dryness, which can aggravate symptoms.
Avoid Harsh Products
: Avoid using harsh skincare products that contain alcohol or fragrances, as these can irritate the skin and exacerbate seborrhoeic dermatitis. Choose gentle, fragrance-free products designed for sensitive skin.
Manage Stress
: Stress can cause or exacerbate seborrhoeic dermatitis flare-ups. Meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or mindfulness are all stress-reduction techniques that can help you manage your stress.
Limit hot showers
: Hot water can deplete the skin's natural oils, causing dryness and irritation. Short, lukewarm showers are preferable to hot showers, and scrubbing the affected areas vigorously is not recommended.
Shield Your Skin from the Sun
: Exposure to the sun can exacerbate the symptoms of seborrhoeic dermatitis and cause inflammation of the skin. Even on overcast days, use a broad-spectrum
sunscreen
with SPF 30 or higher every day, and avoid the sun between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Steer Clear of Trigger Foods
: For some people, certain foods can cause or exacerbate the symptoms of seborrhoeic dermatitis. Common trigger foods include sugary foods, processed foods, dairy products, and foods high in saturated fats. Keep track of your diet and identify any potential trigger foods that may exacerbate your symptoms.
Maintain Good Scalp Hygiene
: If you have seborrhoeic dermatitis, shampoo your scalp on a regular basis with a medicated shampoo that contains ingredients like ketoconazole, selenium sulphide, or zinc pyrithione. Gently massage the shampoo into your scalp and let it sit for a few minutes before thoroughly rinsing.
Stay Hydrated
: Drink plenty of water all day to keep your skin hydrated from the inside out. Proper hydration can help to maintain skin barrier function while reducing dryness and irritation.
Get Enough Sleep
: A lack of sleep can impair the immune system and aggravate skin conditions such as seborrhoeic dermatitis. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to improve skin health and immune function.
Consult a Dermatologist
: If lifestyle changes and over-the-counter remedies are not working for your seborrhoeic dermatitis, see a dermatologist for a full evaluation and treatment options. They can prescribe medications or suggest alternative therapies based on your specific condition.

Use as Directed
: Follow your healthcare provider's directions for using the prescription shampoo. Depending on the severity of your condition, you may need to apply the shampoo daily, every other day, or a few times per week. Consistent application is critical for achieving and maintaining results.
Avoid Contact with Eyes
: Prescription shampoo can irritate your eyes, so avoid getting it in them. If your eyes come into contact with something, thoroughly rinse them with water.
Follow Up With Moisturizer
: Some prescription shampoos can be drying to the scalp. After shampooing, apply a gentle, moisturizing conditioner or scalp treatment to help hydrate and soothe the skin.
Monitor for Side Effects
: Pay attention to how your scalp and hair respond to the prescription shampoo. If you experience irritation, redness, or a worsening of your symptoms, stop using it and see your doctor.
C
ombine with Other Treatments
