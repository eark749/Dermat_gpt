Are you struggling with hair loss? Topical finasteride is a medication that is used to treat hair loss in men and women. It is a topical version of the oral medication finasteride, which works by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that contributes to hair loss. It's also one of the two FDA-approved hair loss treatments. In this article, we'll explore the benefits of topical finasteride, how to use it, and any potential side effects to be aware of. Whether you're a long-time finasteride user or just considering it for the first time, read on to learn more about this game-changing hair loss solution.
What is topical finasteride and how it works
Finasteride is a drug commonly used to treat male pattern baldness (
androgenic alopecia
). It works by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme known as 5-alpha-reductase, which converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (
DHT
), a hormone that can cause hair loss.
Topical finasteride is a newer formulation of the drug that is applied to the scalp rather than taken orally. The idea behind topical finasteride is to reduce the risk of side effects associated with the oral form, such as sexual dysfunction, by limiting the drug's systemic absorption.
When applied topically, finasteride is believed to work by inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase activity in the hair follicles themselves, which can help to reduce levels of DHT and promote
hair growth
. Because it is a newer formulation, there is still ongoing research to fully understand its efficacy and safety. However, some early studies have suggested that topical finasteride may be just as effective as the oral form in treating
male pattern baldness
, while potentially minimizing side effects.
Understanding the mechanism of action of topical finasteride for hair loss
Topical finasteride, like its oral counterpart, works by inhibiting the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase. This enzyme is responsible for converting testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a more potent androgen hormone. DHT is implicated in miniaturization of hair follicles in individuals genetically predisposed to androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness).
By inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase, finasteride reduces the levels of DHT in the scalp tissue. This helps to counteract the shrinking of hair follicles and prolongs the growth phase of the hair cycle, leading to thicker and healthier hair.
Topical finasteride is believed to have a localized effect on the scalp, minimizing systemic exposure and potential side effects that can occur with oral finasteride. This makes it a promising option for individuals who may be concerned about systemic side effects but still wish to benefit from the therapeutic effects of finasteride for hair loss.
Exploring the scientific research supporting the efficacy of topical finasteride
Scientific research demonstrating the efficacy of topical finasteride for hair loss has accumulated over time. Here are some major studies that demonstrate its usefulness, including: A recent study published in the Journal of Dermatological Treatment examined the efficacy and safety of topical finasteride at two different concentrations (0.5% and 1%). Both concentrations were shown to be beneficial in increasing hair growth, with the 1% dose exhibiting slightly better outcomes. The treatment was well tolerated, with no significant side effects noted. These trials provide evidence for topical finasteride's efficacy and safety in the treatment of male pattern hair loss. However, further research may be required to determine its long-term efficacy and safety profile.
Topical finasteride vs oral
Finasteride, whether topical or oral, is an effective treatment for hair loss, particularly androgenetic alopecia. However, they differ in several ways, including efficacy, side effects, and application method. Here is a comparison between the two.
Efficacy
: Both topical and oral finasteride inhibit the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, reducing testosterone conversion to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). By lowering DHT levels, both treatments help to slow down hair loss and promote hair regrowth. Clinical trials have shown that both formulations can effectively treat male pattern hair loss, with some evidence suggesting that oral finasteride may be slightly more effective.
Side Effects
: Systemic side effects of oral finasteride include decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and tender breasts. These side effects result from the systemic inhibition of DHT throughout the body. In contrast, topical finasteride is thought to have a more localised effect on the scalp, resulting in lower systemic absorption and possibly fewer systemic side effects. However, some people may still experience local side effects such as scalp irritation or itching after topical application.
Application
: Finasteride is taken orally as pills, usually once a day. Topical finasteride is applied directly to the scalp, typically as a foam or solution. It may need to be applied every day or every other day. The decision between oral and topical formulations may come down to personal taste, ease of use, and side effect tolerance.
Systemic Absorption
: Topical finasteride has a lower systemic absorption and mainly affects DHT levels in the scalp tissue, whereas oral finasteride is absorbed systemically and can affect DHT levels throughout the body. Topical finasteride might be a better choice for people who are worried about systemic side effects because of its localised action.
Long-term Safety
: The long-term safety profiles of topical and oral finasteride have been investigated. While topical finasteride's long-term safety is still being assessed, oral finasteride has been used for many years and has a well-established safety profile. Nonetheless, preliminary research indicates that topical finasteride might have a good safety profile, especially when it comes to reducing systemic side effects.
Topical finasteride and minoxidil spray
Topical finasteride and minoxidil spray are both hair loss treatments, but they work in very different ways.
Topical Finasteride
: Finasteride is a medication that works by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that shrinks hair follicles and causes hair loss in people with a genetic predisposition. Topical finasteride is applied directly to the scalp as a solution or gel. By inhibiting DHT at the scalp level, it aids in the prevention of further hair loss and may promote hair growth.
Minoxidil Spray
: Minoxidil is another medication for hair loss. It works by increasing blood flow to the scalp and stimulating hair follicles, which promotes hair growth. Minoxidil is available in a variety of formulations, including solutions, foams, and sprays. The spray formulation allows for simple application directly to the scalp.
Topical finasteride side effects
Topical finasteride, like its oral counterpart, can cause side effects, but they are usually less frequent and less severe when applied topically. Here are some of the possible side effects associated with topical finasteride:
Scalp Irritation
: Some users may experience scalp irritation, redness, itching, or burning sensations at the application site. This is usually mild and resolves on its own with continued use or by changing the application frequency or dosage.
Sexual Side Effects
: While topical finasteride is intended to have minimal systemic absorption, some people may experience sexual side effects such as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, or changes in ejaculatory function. These side effects are less common with topical finasteride than with the oral form, but they can still occur in some cases.
Allergic Reactions
: In rare cases, people may become allergic to the ingredients in the topical finasteride formulation. An allergic reaction may cause a rash, hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing. If you notice any signs of an allergic reaction, stop using the product and seek medical attention right away.
Other Side Effects
: Topical finasteride may cause headache, dizziness, or breast tenderness. These side effects are uncommon and usually mild.
How to apply topical finasteride spray

Takeaway: Topical finasteride for hair loss
Topical finasteride is a medication that is used to treat hair loss in both men and women. It is a topical solution that is applied directly to the scalp and is designed to inhibit the production of the hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the scalp. DHT is believed to be a key factor in the development of male pattern baldness, and reducing its production can help to slow down or reverse the process of hair loss.
Topical finasteride works by blocking the action of the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, which converts testosterone into DHT. By inhibiting the production of DHT, topical finasteride can help to reduce inflammation and promote hair growth.
One of the advantages of using topical finasteride is that it has fewer systemic side effects compared to oral finasteride. While oral finasteride can cause sexual side effects in some people, topical finasteride is less likely to cause these side effects because it is applied directly to the scalp and does not get absorbed into the bloodstream. However, it is important to note that there is still some risk of systemic side effects with topical finasteride, especially if it is used in high doses or if it is applied to broken or irritated skin. Common side effects of topical finasteride include scalp irritation, itching, and dryness.
