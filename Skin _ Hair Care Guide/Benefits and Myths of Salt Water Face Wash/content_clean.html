<h3><b>Common Misconceptions About Salt Water Face Wash</b></h3>
<p><span>Although saltwater face wash has grown in popularity due to its stated benefits, there are various misconceptions about how to use it. Below are some frequent misconceptions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Myth</b><span>: Salt water is good for all skin types. </span><b>Reality</b><span>: Salt water can be irritating to delicate or dry skin types.

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Myth</b><span>: Salt Water Face Wash Is Safe for Daily Use. </span><b>Reality</b><span>: Using salt water daily can upset the skin's natural moisture balance, causing dryness, particularly in people with dry or sensitive skin.

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Myth</b><span>: Salt Water Face Wash works instantly. </span><b>Reality</b><span>: Like other skincare treatments, salt water face wash may take some time to provide benefits. Consistent and moderate application is required to reap possible advantages without harming the skin.</span></p>
