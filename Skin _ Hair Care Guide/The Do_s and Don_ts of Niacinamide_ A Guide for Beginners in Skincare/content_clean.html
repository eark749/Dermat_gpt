<p><span>Vitamin B3 in the form of niacinamide is a popular skincare ingredient with many advantageous effects on the skin. Here's how to incorporate niacinamide into your skincare routine, step by step:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Cleanse</b><span>: To begin, clean your face to remove any dirt, oil, or makeup. Use a</span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-foaming-face-wash"> </a><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-foaming-face-wash"><b>gentle cleanser</b></a><span> that will not remove your skin's natural oils.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Tone</b><span>: After cleansing, use a toner to balance your skin's pH and prepare it for the following steps in your routine.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Serum</b><span>: Apply a niacinamide serum to your face. It's best to use a product that contains at least 5% niacinamide. Gently massage the serum into your skin, making sure to cover your entire face.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Moisturize</b><span>: Finish by hydrating your skin with a</span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hydrasoothe-moisturiser"> </a><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hydrasoothe-moisturiser"><b>moisturiser</b></a><span>. Because niacinamide can help improve skin barrier function, using a moisturizer will help lock in the serum's benefits.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sun protection</b><span>: To protect your skin from the damaging effects of UV rays, use a broad-spectrum</span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-sunprotect-sunscreen-spf-50"> </a><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-sunprotect-sunscreen-spf-50"><b>sunscreen</b></a><span> with an SPF of 30 or higher.</span></p>

It can also assist in enhancing the skin's natural barrier function, enabling it to retain moisture and protect against irritants from the outside.</span></p>
<p><span>Niacinamide can help the skin's natural repairing process while you sleep at night. It can also help regulate oil production and improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles in the morning, giving you a brighter and more even complexion. </span></p>
<h2><b>Mixing/Layering Niacinamide with Other Active Ingredients</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Mixing/Layering Niacinamide with Other Active Ingredients" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Mixing_Layering_Niacinamide_with_Other_Active_Ingredients_480x480.jpg?v=1719476933"/></div>
<p><span>Niacinamide is a safe and adaptable ingredient for skincare that can be used in conjunction with a variety of other active ingredients. The compatibility of two or more ingredients is dependent on a number of factors, including the pH levels, concentrations, and formulations of the products. Some common active ingredients that can be combined or layered with niacinamide are as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Vitamin C</b><span>: Niacinamide and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-vitamin-c3-serum">Vitamin C</a> are both antioxidants that can complement one another and benefit the skin more when used together. However, it is critical to use products containing a stable form of Vitamin C and to layer them carefully, as the combination of niacinamide and ascorbic acid can affect Vitamin C stability.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Retinoids</b><span>: Niacinamide can be combined with retinoids such as retinol, but the pH level of the retinoid product should be compatible with niacinamide for the best results.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hyaluronic Acid</b><span>: Both niacinamide and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hyaluronic-skinbooster-serum">hyaluronic acid</a> are hydrating ingredients that can be combined to provide additional hydration to the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>AHA/BHA</b><span>: Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs) and Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHAs) can be combined with niacinamide, but the pH levels of the products must be compatible for the best results.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>The key to successfully mixing or layering niacinamide with other active ingredients is to consider your skin's specific needs and responses. If you have any concerns or questions about combining specific ingredients, talk to a dermatologist or skincare expert for personalised advice.</span></p>
<h3><b>Niacinamide and Hyaluronic Acid</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Niacinamide and Hyaluronic Acid" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Niacinamide_and_Hyaluronic_Acid_480x480.jpg?v=1719476967"/></div>
<p><span>Niacinamide and</span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hyaluronic-skinbooster-serum"> </a><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hyaluronic-skinbooster-serum"><b>hyaluronic acid</b></a><span> are both popular skincare ingredients. Niacinamide is a type of vitamin B3 that is frequently used in skin care products because of its ability to improve the skin barrier, reduce inflammation, and boost the skin's natural production of ceramides, which aid in moisture retention. Niacinamide can also help with fine lines, hyperpigmentation, and redness. In contrast, hyaluronic acid is a substance that the body produces naturally and that helps to hydrate the skin and retain water. It is an effective skin moisturizer because it can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water. In skin care products, hyaluronic acid and niacinamide can be combined to increase hydration and benefit the skin. </span></p>

Moisturizers, which come in lotions, creams, and ointments, can be used to treat a wide range of skin problems, including dryness, flakiness, and roughness. Combining a niacinamide-containing product with a moisturizer is a great way to get the most out of both ingredients. The niacinamide can help to improve the overall health of the skin, while the moisturizer hydrates and protects it from further drying. It is critical to choose a moisturizer that is suitable for your skin type, as some may be too heavy or too light. </span></p>

<div><img alt="Niacinamide and Retinol" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Niacinamide_and_Retinol_480x480.jpg?v=1719477638"/></div>
<p><span>Niacinamide and</span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-skin-renewer-retinol-serum"> </a><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-skin-renewer-retinol-serum"><b>retinol</b></a><span> are two popular skincare ingredients that have different skin benefits. Niacinamide is a type of vitamin B3 that has been shown to improve skin elasticity and even skin tone, reduce redness and blotchiness and improve skin barrier function. It helps treat acne and lessen the visibility of wrinkles and fine lines. On the other hand, retinol, a derivative of vitamin A, is well known for its anti-aging benefits. By boosting cell turnover, retinol makes wrinkles, age spots, and fine lines less noticeable. Its ability to</span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/open-pores"> </a><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/open-pores"><b>open pores</b></a><span> and improve skin texture makes it a popular ingredient for acne-prone skin. Niacinamide and retinol can be used together in a skincare routine, even though they both work well. It is important to note, however, that retinol can be quite strong and cause skin irritation in some people, so it is best, to begin with, a low concentration and gradually increase your use of it. Furthermore, niacinamide should be used in the morning and retinol at night, as retinol can make the skin more sensitive to sunlight. Here's an overview of each ingredient and how they can work together:</span></p>

</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Retinol is a type of vitamin A that is well known for its anti-aging benefits. It stimulates collagen production, promotes cell turnover, and minimises the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation. Retinol also improves skin texture and tone, resulting in a smoother, more radiant complexion.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Retinol is effective for most skin types, but it can cause sensitivity, irritation, and dryness, especially when first used or at high concentrations. To reduce the risk of irritation, start with a lower concentration of retinol and gradually increase your usage.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h3><b>Niacinamide and Salicylic Acid</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Niacinamide and Salicylic Acid" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Niacinamide_and_Salicylic_Acid_480x480.jpg?v=1719477219"/></div>
<p><span>Niacinamide and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/salicylic-range">salicylic acid</a> are two active ingredients commonly found in skincare products. Niacinamide, also known as vitamin B3, is a water-soluble vitamin that has been shown to improve skin barrier function, reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and improve overall skin appearance. It also has brightening and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a popular ingredient for those who have uneven skin tone or redness. Here's how they function and why they are commonly used together:</span></p>
<ol>

<li>
<p><span>Niacinamide is well tolerated by most skin types, including sensitive and acne-prone skin. It is regarded as a gentle yet effective ingredient that can be used daily.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><b>Salicylic Acid</b><span>:</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Salicylic acid is a beta hydroxy acid (BHA) that exfoliates the skin by penetrating the pores. It helps to unclog pores, remove excess oil and dead skin cells, and treat acne and blackheads. Salicylic acid also has anti-inflammatory properties, making it useful for reducing the redness and inflammation associated with acne.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Salicylic acid is ideal for oily, acne-prone, and combination skin types. It can be drying or irritating to some people, particularly if used in high concentrations or too frequently. To reduce the risk of irritation, start with lower concentrations and gradually increase your usage.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p><span>In contrast, salicylic acid is a type of beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) that is commonly used to treat acne-prone skin. It exfoliates the skin,</span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/open-clogged-pores"> </a><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/open-clogged-pores"><b>unclogs pores</b></a><span>, and reduces the production of sebum, the oil that contributes to the formation of pimples and blackheads. Salicylic acid also has anti-inflammatory properties, making it an effective ingredient for reducing acne-related redness and swelling. While both niacinamide and salicylic acid can help improve the appearance of the skin, it is critical to use them correctly. Although niacinamide and salicylic acid can be used in the same skincare routine, it is important to alternate their use or apply them at different times of the day because using them together may cause skin irritation. It's also critical to follow the product label's instructions, as using too much of either ingredient can cause skin irritation and dryness.</span></p>
<h3><b>Niacinamide with AHA and BHA</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Niacinamide with AHA and BHA" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Niacinamide_with_AHA_and_BHA_480x480.jpg?v=1719477358"/></div>
<p><span>Niacinamide, Alpha-Hydroxy Acids (AHA), and Beta-Hydroxy Acids (BHA) can work together to improve the appearance of skin. A type of vitamin B3 called niacinamide has been shown to have several benefits for the skin, including a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, an increase in skin elasticity, and support for a uniform skin tone. Exfoliating acids such as AHAs and BHAs help to remove dead skin cells, unclog pores, and improve skin texture. Even though <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/aha-bha-range">AHAs and BHAs</a> can be irritating, they should always be used carefully and follow the guidelines on the product label. Here's how each ingredient functions and how they can complement one another:</span></p>

<li>
<p><b>Niacinamide (Vitamin B3)</b><span>:</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Niacinamide is a versatile skincare ingredient that improves skin texture, reduces the appearance of pores, minimises fine lines and wrinkles, and brightens the complexion. It also improves the skin's barrier, regulates oil production, and reduces inflammation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Niacinamide is well tolerated by the majority of skin types, including sensitive and acne-prone skin. It is compatible with a wide range of skincare ingredients and can be combined with other active ingredients without causing significant irritation.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><b>Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs)</b><span>:</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>AHAs like glycolic acid, lactic acid, and mandelic acid are frequently used in skincare products to exfoliate the skin by loosening dead skin cells, promoting cell turnover, and revealing smoother, brighter skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>AHAs improve skin texture, reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, fade hyperpigmentation and dark spots, and increase skin radiance. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>While AHAs can be effective for most skin types, they may cause sensitivity, particularly in people with sensitive or reactive skin. To reduce the risk of irritation, start with low concentrations and gradually increase the frequency.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><b>Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHAs)</b><span>:</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Salicylic acid is the most widely used BHA in skincare products. It is oil-soluble, which makes it ideal for exfoliating inside the pores, removing excess oil, and treating acne and blackheads.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>BHAs unclog pores, reduce acne breakouts, control oiliness, and improve skin clarity. They also have anti-inflammatory properties, which make them ideal for acne-prone and sensitive skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>BHAs are well-tolerated by most skin types, including oily and acne-prone skin. However, they can be drying or irritating for some individuals, especially if used in high concentrations or too frequently.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>AHAs and BHAs<span> can affect the stability of niacinamide when combined with it because of the different pH levels between them. It's typically best to use niacinamide first, followed by AHA/BHA products, or to alternate using them on different days. It's also important to wear sunscreen because AHAs and BHAs can make your skin more sensitive to UV rays. </span></p>
<h2><b>Takeaway: Prevent Acne and Reduce Signs of Ageing with Star Ingredient Niacinamide!</b></h2>

<p><span>Niacinamide, also known as vitamin B3, has several skin benefits. It can help prevent acne by regulating the production of sebum, a skin oil that can cause clogged pores and breakouts. It has been demonstrated to increase skin hydration, lessen visibility, and improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, making niacinamide a fantastic anti-aging ingredient. It is commonly used in skincare products at concentrations of 2-5% and is well tolerated by most skin types. It is available in serums, creams, and lotions, among other forms. While niacinamide has numerous benefits, everyone's skin is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. Patch test a small area of skin before applying it all over your face is always a good idea with any new skincare product to ensure there are no adverse reactions.</span></p>
