<p><span>Retrograde alopecia is a lesser-known cause of hair loss that many people who have unexplained hair loss find difficult to understand. Unlike male pattern hair loss, retrograde alopecia affects the nape of the neck, the area above the ears, and, in rare cases, the sides of the scalp. Medication treatments include minoxidil and finasteride, as well as lifestyle adjustments and hair transplants. This blog will look at the most recent research and provide expert or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">dermatologists</a> advice on the causes and treatment of retrograde alopecia.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is Retrograde Alopecia?</b></h2>
<div><img alt="What is Retrograde Alopecia?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/What_is_Retrograde_Alopecia_480x480.jpg?v=1723466358"/></div>
<p><span>Retrograde alopecia is defined as thinning in places that are generally resistant to <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/androgenetic-alopecia-causes-treatments-and-home-remedies">androgenetic alopecia</a>. These comprise the nape of the neck and the space above the ears. Unlike ordinary male pattern <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/bald-patches">baldness</a>, retrograde alopecia preferentially affects these less common locations, ultimately leading to follicular death. The specific cause is not fully known. Scientists believe it is linked to hormonal causes similar to those found in androgenetic alopecia.</span></p>
<h3><b>Definition and Overview</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Definition and Overview" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Definition_and_Overview_480x480.jpg?v=1723466359"/></div>
<p><span>The development of a bald patch on the head and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-fall-hair-loss">hair loss</a> around the temples are the typical symptoms of male pattern baldness, also referred to as androgenetic alopecia. However, in rare cases of aggressive androgenetic alopecia, men may experience hair loss on the back of the head, around the ears, and the nape. This is referred to as retrograde alopecia. Retrograde alopecia (RA) most commonly affects men with significant hair loss at Norwood Scale stages 6-7. In addition to generating evident indications of hair loss, retrograde alopecia can have an impact on the success of a hair transplant.</span></p>
<h3><b>How It Differs from Other Types of Alopecia</b></h3>
<div><img alt="How It Differs from Other Types of Alopecia" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/How_It_Differs_from_Other_Types_of_Alopecia_480x480.jpg?v=1723466359"/></div>
<p><span>The most common types of alopecia are described below, along with their causes and symptoms.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Alopecia areata</b><span>: The primary sign of <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/alopecia-areata">alopecia areata</a> is hair loss in patches, typically on the scalp. However, alopecia areata can also affect the brows, eyelashes, and other areas of the body. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease. Alopecia areata occurs when the immune system erroneously assaults healthy hair follicles, which are microscopic, pocket-like holes in our skin that develop hair, in the same manner that the immune system would fight an illness. An injury to the follicles causes hair loss. This kind of alopecia typically runs in families.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Persistent patchy alopecia areata</b><span>: Persistent patchy alopecia areata occur when patchy hair loss persists without improving or worsening over time. It is caused by the same reasons that contribute to alopecia areata.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Alopecia totalis</b><span>:</span> <span>Alopecia totalis refers to hair loss that affects the entire scalp. It appears to be linked to an abnormal immune system response, as do several other types of alopecia. However, experts are still working to determine the exact causes of alopecia totalis.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Alopecia universalis</b><span>:</span> <span>Alopecia universalis is a disorder that causes full hair loss. This includes both the scalp and the rest of the body. As with other autoimmune disorders, it is unclear why some people develop this syndrome and others do not.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Diffuse alopecia areata</b><span>: Diffuse alopecia areata is sometimes called telogen effluvium. Unlike alopecia areata, your hair thins and subsequently comes out in dispersed regions throughout the scalp rather than in patches. In rare situations, identical hair loss patterns might occur in other parts of the body. Severe stress, rapid hormonal changes, and drug side effects are all possible causes.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Ophiasis alopecia</b><span>:</span> <span>Ophiasis alopecia is a form of alopecia areata that mostly affects the sides and back of the scalp. It’s an autoimmune disorder that mainly affects young people.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2><b>Identifying the Causes of Retrograde Alopecia</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Identifying the Causes of Retrograde Alopecia" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Identifying_the_Causes_of_Retrograde_Alopecia_480x480.jpg?v=1723466359"/></div>
<p><span>Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder in which your immune system attacks your body. Your immune system targets your hair follicles because it believes they are foreign invaders (bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungus) that cause infection, illness, and disease. When this happens, your hair starts to come out, usually in clumps the size and shape of a quarter. The extent of hair loss varies. In other circumstances, it's only in a few locations. In others, the hair loss may be more severe, including complete hair loss. Your genetic composition (the components of your cells that define your physical characteristics, such as eye color, height, or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-colour">hair color</a>) may cause your body to react in an autoimmune way. Alternatively, your genetic composition mixed with a virus or another chemical you encounter may cause the reaction.</span></p>
<h3><b>Genetic Factors</b></h3>
<p><span>Retrograde alopecia, like other types of hair loss caused by hereditary causes (such as androgenetic alopecia), is thought to be a progressive disorder that is not curable. In rare cases, appropriate treatment can reduce or even prevent hair loss from progressing further.</span></p>
<h3><b>Environmental Triggers</b></h3>
<p><span>Alopecia areata can be caused by environmental factors such as stress, injury, or sickness. However, in many cases, it is unclear why someone develops alopecia areata.</span></p>
<h3><b>Hormonal Influences</b></h3>
<p><span>Testosterone is converted into the hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Androgenetic alopecia occurs when you inherit genetic alterations that make your hair follicles hypersensitive to DHT. As a result, the follicles shrink and generate weaker hair for a while before ceasing to produce new hair entirely.</span></p>
<h2><b>Recognizing Symptoms of Retrograde Alopecia</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Recognizing Symptoms of Retrograde Alopecia" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Recognizing_Symptoms_of_Retrograde_Alopecia_480x480.jpg?v=1723466361"/></div>
<p><span>Symptoms of retrograde alopecia include</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Thinning or loss of hair in regions that are resistant to regular balding patterns. Specifically, above the nape of the neck, above the ears, and occasionally on the sides of the scalp.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The hairline may stay intact, but the affected area of the scalp develops vertical alopecia.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Individuals may develop diminished hair follicles, resulting in frontal hair thinning comparable to androgenetic alopecia. The distinction is in the abnormal pattern of hair loss in certain locations.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Retrograde alopecia is frequently characterized by gradual thinning, making it difficult to detect in the early stages.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>To properly diagnose vertical thinning, consult a dermatologist or hair restoration specialist, who can provide advice on both surgical and non-surgical hair restoration options.</span></p>
<h3><b>Early Signs and Indicators</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Early Signs and Indicators" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Early_Signs_and_Indicators_480x480.jpg?v=1723466357"/></div>
<p><span>People with the condition are typically healthy and exhibit no additional symptoms. Alopecia areata often begins with the rapid loss of round or oval patches of hair on the scalp, although it can affect any part of the body, including the beard area in men, as well as the brows and eyelashes.</span></p>
<h3><b>Progression and Severity</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Progression and Severity" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Progression_and_Severity_480x480.jpg?v=1723466359"/></div>
<p><span>Retrograde alopecia, often known as "vertical alopecia," is characterized by vertical hair thinning and density reduction. It often starts at the nape of the neck and moves up into the lower occipital zone, which is the traditional donor area for hair transplants. </span></p>
<h3><b>Impact on Hair and Scalp Health</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Impact on Hair and Scalp Health" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Impact_on_Hair_and_Scalp_Health_fc88c137-f1e4-40a7-8832-74caf7016a04_480x480.jpg?v=1723466358"/></div>
<h3><b>Hair Health</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The primary and most visible effect is the loss of hair along the hairline. This may occur gradually, changing the hairline's shape in a discernible way.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>In areas where hair remains, it may become thinner and more fragile, making it prone to breakage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The normal hair growth cycle can be disrupted, resulting in slower <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hair-regrow-serum%20">hair growth</a> and a higher proportion of hair in the resting phase (telogen).</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Scalp Health</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Affected areas of the scalp may become more sensitive and irritated.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>There may be underlying inflammation in the scalp, leading to additional hair loss and discomfort.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Retrograde alopecia can occasionally result in <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">scarring</a>, which can impede the growth of new hair in the affected areas.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Inflammation or scarring may cause the scalp's texture to shift, either becoming smoother or more uneven in certain situations.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Effective Treatment Options for Retrograde Alopecia</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Effective Treatment Options for Retrograde Alopecia" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Effective_Treatment_Options_for_Retrograde_Alopecia_480x480.jpg?v=1723466359"/></div>
<p><span>Retrograde alopecia treatment is similar to androgenetic alopecia treatment because of the similarity between the two types of hair loss. The FDA has approved three treatment options for androgenetic alopecia at this time: oral finasteride, topical minoxidil, and low-level laser therapy, or LLLT.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/scalp-solution">Minoxidil</a> promotes new hair development by boosting blood flow to the hair follicles and causing hairs to enter the growth phase of the hair cycle. This drug is offered in two forms: a topical solution or a minoxidil foam.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Oral finasteride reduces your body's DHT production, slowing or stopping the DHT-induced hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Low-level laser therapy or laser hair growth treatments may appear frightening, but they can be helpful and safe for the majority of patients. These modern methods of treatment boost blood circulation and promote fresh hair growth.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Hair transplant surgery is another treatment option for retrograde alopecia. It entails extracting donor hair grafts from the sides and back of your scalp and implanting them in regions of hair loss or thinning. Hair restoration methods are generally classified into two types: follicular unit extraction (FUE) and follicular unit transplantation (FUT). If you aren't ready for medical hair loss treatments yet or simply want a boost, you might try a hair loss prevention shampoo with components like saw palmetto and ketoconazole to slow down retrograde alopecia.</span></p>
<h3><b>Medical Treatments and Medications</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Medical Treatments and Medications" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Medical_Treatments_and_Medications_1_480x480.jpg?v=1723466358"/></div>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Topical Treatments</b>
<p><span>: Minoxidil (Rogaine), when administered directly to the scalp, is a well-known over-the-counter therapy that can promote hair growth and slow hair loss. It is frequently used twice a day and can produce results over several months. Topical corticosteroids help reduce inflammation in the scalp, which may be causing hair loss. They are typically prescribed for short-term use.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Oral Medications</b><span>: Finasteride (Propecia) acts by preventing the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone associated with hair loss. It is administered orally and can help reduce hair loss and promote regeneration. In more severe cases, corticosteroids can be injected directly into the scalp to alleviate inflammation and stimulate hair growth.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Anti-Inflammatory Treatments</b><span>: Topical immunotherapy is used to induce a small allergic reaction on the scalp, which can aid in hair growth.  When autoimmune reactions are suspected of causing hair loss, medications such as methotrexate or cyclosporine may be administered. These medications work to reduce the immune system's attack on hair follicles.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT)</b><span>: This non-invasive procedure uses lasers to stimulate hair follicles, enhance blood flow, and encourage hair growth. It is commonly performed at clinics, although it can also be done at home using specialist equipment.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy</b><span>: PRP therapy involves extracting a small sample of the patient's blood, processing it to concentrate the platelets, and then injecting it back into the scalp. The growth factors found in platelets can help encourage hair growth and improve scalp health.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Surgical Treatments</b><span>: Hair transplant surgery is an option if other therapies are ineffective. Hair follicles are extracted from a donor location (typically the back of the head) and transplanted to alopecia-affected areas.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Supportive Treatments</b><span>: Vitamins and minerals, including biotin, zinc, and iron, help improve general hair health. Having a well-balanced diet and even taking supplements if inadequacies are discovered will help.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Natural and Home Remedies</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Natural and Home Remedies" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Natural_and_Home_Remedies_480x480.jpg?v=1723466358"/></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Aloe Vera</b><span>: Apply pure aloe vera gel to your scalp and let it sit for 30 minutes before rinsing with lukewarm water. Aloe vera has anti-inflammatory properties that can soothe the scalp while also promoting healthy hair growth.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Coconut Oil</b><span>: Apply warm coconut <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-oil">hair oil</a> to your scalp and leave it on for at least an hour or overnight before washing it off. Coconut oil has moisturizing and anti-inflammatory qualities that allow it to permeate the hair shaft, minimize protein loss, and enhance scalp health.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Onion Juice</b><span>: Blend an onion to extract the juice, then apply it to your scalp and leave it on for 15-30 minutes before washing with a gentle shampoo. Onion juice contains sulfur compounds, which may improve blood circulation to hair follicles, thereby stimulating hair growth.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Rosemary Oil</b><span>: Combine a few drops of rosemary essential oil with a carrier oil (such as jojoba or coconut oil) and massage the scalp. Allow it to stay on for at least an hour before washing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Green Tea</b><span>: Make green tea, let it cool, and use it to rinse your hair after shampooing. Green tea contains <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/antioxidants">antioxidants</a>, which can help prevent hair loss and promote hair growth.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Egg Mask</b><span>: Combine one egg and a tablespoon of olive oil and apply to the scalp and hair. Leave it on for 20 minutes before rinsing it with cold water. Eggs are high in protein, which strengthens hair follicles and promotes healthy hair growth.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Fenugreek Seeds</b><span>: Soak the seeds overnight, then grind them into a paste and apply to your scalp. After 30 minutes, rinse. Fenugreek seeds contain proteins and nicotinic acid, which can help promote hair growth and repair damaged hair.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Lifestyle Changes and Preventative Measures</b></h3>

<p><span>Hair loss affects many guys in a variety of ways. If you're losing hair near the nape of your neck, you may have retrograde alopecia, a rare form of male pattern baldness.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>There is little research on retrograde alopecia. However, it appears to be linked to androgenetic alopecia, which is the most frequent kind of hair loss in men and is caused by genetics and DHT.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Retrograde alopecia symptoms include hair loss in the rear of the head, behind the ears, and at the base of the neck, as opposed to androgenetic alopecia, which causes hair loss at the temples and crown.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Retrograde alopecia therapies are comparable to those for androgenetic alopecia, and may include oral finasteride, topical minoxidil, laser hair growth therapy, and possibly hair restoration surgery.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Dealing with any type of hair loss can be frustrating, but there are solutions. During an online consultation with a healthcare provider or dermatologist, you can discuss your symptoms and learn about other hair loss treatments.</span></p>
