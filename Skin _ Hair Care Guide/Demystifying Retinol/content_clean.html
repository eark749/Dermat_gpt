<p>Retinol is another name for Vitamin A. It’s a type of retinoid, the family of chemical compounds related to Vitamin A. Other retinoids include retinoic acid, retinaldehyde, and retinyl palmitate. In addition to being a trusted treatment for acne, retinol is famous for its anti-ageing properties as well. Retinols increase the cell turnover rate, unclog pores and reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</p>
<p>Retinol now come as OTC serums, creams and night reparative creams option. One can easily introduce these in their routine skincare regimen, as they have very less concentration of retinol that gently improves the skin quality over time.</p>

Retinoids have a much higher cell turnover rate so it is given for unresponsive acne or severe acne conditions. But retinols on the other hand cause controlled cell turnover which leads to rejuvenation of skin in a subtle manner.</p>
