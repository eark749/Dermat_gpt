<p><span>Hairline <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-the-ultimate-nia-10-niacinamide-serum">acne</a> is caused by various conditions that cause inflammation and irritation to the hair follicles.

<p><span>Several recurring factors can cause hairline acne by causing inflammation and irritation of the hair follicles. It is important to identify these triggers to control and prevent outbreaks. Common causes of hairline acne include hair products, excessive oil production, poor scalp hygiene, sweat and humidity, bacterial or fungal infections, hormonal changes, allergic reactions, stress, tight headwear, and a poor diet.</span></p>

<p><span>Different hair care products used for cleaning and styling hair contain oils and irritating ingredients. These oils can <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/open-pores">clog pores</a>, leading to acne. Helmets, hats, headbands, etc. can also trap sweat, dead skin cells, and hair products in the area around the hairline.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Role of Hormones in Hairline Acne</b></h3>
<div><img alt="The Role of Hormones in Hairline Acne" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/The_Role_of_Hormones_in_Hairline_Acne_480x480.jpg?v=1726052916"/></div>
<p><span>Acne is often called hormonal acne because a hormone called testosterone plays a key role in it. During puberty, testosterone levels are high, which contributes to physical growth in boys and increased muscle and bone strength in girls. This hormone also stimulates increased sebum production in the hair follicles because the oil-secreting glands are responsive to testosterone. Other hormones also influence acne development. In women, hormonal fluctuations related to pregnancy or the menstrual cycle can trigger acne, and decreased estrogen levels during menopause may heighten the risk of acne. The impact of progesterone on acne is not fully understood. Additionally, conditions that disrupt hormone levels, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), can also lead to acne.</span></p>
