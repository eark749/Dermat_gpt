<p><span>Acne is a common skin condition that affects millions of people worldwide, but it is especially prevalent among teenagers. The hormonal changes that occur during adolescence can cause an increase in sebum production, leading to clogged pores and the development of acne. While it is a natural part of growing up, the emotional and social impact of acne can be significant. Understanding the causes and treatment options for teenage acne is crucial for both adolescents and their parents, as it can help manage the condition and alleviate its effects. In this article, we will delve into the causes of teenage acne and explore effective treatment options to help young people achieve clear and healthy skin.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What Causes Teen Acne?</strong></h3>
<p><span>Teen acne is primarily caused by hormonal changes during puberty, which can lead to increased oil production in the skin. This excess oil, combined with dead skin cells, can clog pores and create the perfect environment for acne-causing bacteria to thrive. Other factors that contribute to teen acne include genetics, diet, stress, and using the wrong skincare products.</span></p>
<h3><strong>How Hormonal Changes Affect Teen Skin</strong></h3>
<p><span>During puberty, the body undergoes significant hormonal changes. Increased levels of androgens, such as testosterone, can cause the sebaceous glands to produce more oil. This excess oil can mix with dead skin cells and clog pores, leading to the formation of pimples, whiteheads, blackheads, and in severe cases, cystic acne.</span></p>
