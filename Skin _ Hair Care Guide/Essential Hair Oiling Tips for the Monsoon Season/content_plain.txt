Hair oiling is an excellent technique to nourish and preserve your hair, particularly during the monsoon season, when humidity and rain can create a variety of hair problems. This blog discusses some vital hair oiling suggestions during the rainy season.
Why Hair Oiling is Crucial During Monsoon
During the monsoon, the scalp accumulates dirt, sweat, and extra oil more quickly. To fight this, wash your hair more often than usual, especially if you have an
oily scalp
. However, avoid overwashing, since this can remove essential oils and produce dryness in the ends.
Benefits of Hair Oiling in Humid Weather
The monsoon season is characterized by high humidity levels, which can cause your hair to become
frizzy
and drab. Oiling your hair at this time might assist to nourish and protect it from the elements. Here are many benefits of oiling your hair during the monsoon season.
Keeps your scalp healthy
: Oiling your scalp during the monsoon season can help prevent
dandruff
and other scalp issues. It also keeps your scalp hydrated, preventing it from becoming dry and flaky.
Nourishes your hair
: Applying oil to your hair will nourish and condition it.  This is especially important during the monsoon season when humidity can cause hair damage.
Prevents frizz
: Monsoon season can be harsh on your hair. The humidity in the air can cause frizz, and prolonged exposure to water can strip your hair of its natural oils. This is why it is important to oil your hair during the monsoon.
Hair oil
can help to keep your hair hydrated and nourished while also taming frizz and creating a smooth and sleek appearance.
Protects your hair
: Applying oil to your hair can help it resist the damaging effects of humidity and rain.
Makes your hair easier to manage
: Oiling your hair can help you style and manage it more easily during the monsoon season.
Common Hair Problems in Monsoon
The monsoon season presents a slew of hair issues due to increased humidity and exposure to rainwater. Frizziness, Hair Fall, Dandruff and Scalp Infections, Greasy Scalp, Limp and Lifeless Hair, Split Ends, Tangled Hair, Loss of Natural Shine, Scalp Itchiness, and
hair color
Fading are some of the most frequent hair difficulties that people experience during the monsoon season, as well as recommendations for dealing with them.
How Oiling Helps Combat Hair Issues
Regular oiling may protect hair from the damaging effects of pollutants and toxins found in shampoo. It may help improve
hydration
, lustre, and gloss while perhaps preventing
hair loss
. Garodia emphasizes the necessity of understanding your hair's needs and selecting an oil accordingly.
Choosing the Right Hair Oil for Monsoon
We believe that monsoon hair care begins with smart oiling! Here's how to make it work for you.
Choose the Right Oil
: During the monsoon season, use lighter oils such as coconut oil, jojoba oil, and almond oil. These oils penetrate the scalp easily and do not weigh down your hair.
Focus on Scalp Massage
: Gently massage your scalp with oil to improve blood circulation and
hair growth
.
Leave-in Time
: Unlike in the hot summer months, do not leave oil on your hair overnight during the monsoon. Apply the oil one to two hours before washing your hair.
Washing is Essential
: During the monsoon season, regular washing is required to remove excess moisture and prevent fungal infections. Use a mild
shampoo
and
conditioner
that is appropriate for your hair type.
Best Oils for Different Hair Types
The best oils for different hair types are as follows:
Curly hair
: Cold-pressed oils such as coconut oil or castor oil are excellent sources of concentrated moisture for coily or curly hair. We recommend using virgin coconut oil, which has been shown to reduce protein loss in hair and improve scalp health. Alternatively, you could use castor oil as an intense pre-shampoo treatment.
Fine hair
: We recommend argan oil for fine hair. Argan oil, which is high in
antioxidants
and vitamin E, helps to seal in moisture, restore hair elasticity and shine, and tame errant flyaways without weighing down your hair.  Argan oil is both a lipid and a lubricant, which are essential for hair fibers and overall hair health.
Frizzy hair
: Avocado oil helps seal the cuticle cells, preventing hair fiber breakage. This makes avocado oil an excellent choice for hair types that struggle to keep their cuticles flat, which includes both dry and frizzy hair.
Oily hair and scalp
: Applying oil to an already oily scalp may seem counterintuitive, but experts say it can revitalize your hair. Massage the scalp weekly with stimulating oils like peppermint, rosemary, and citrus.
Dry hair
: Marula, rosemary, rosehip, and camelina oils are all high in healthy fatty acids and antioxidants, which reduce inflammatory damage and promote hair health.
All hair types
: If you are looking for a lightweight option, try organic shea oil, which is high in vitamins A and E, essential fatty acids, and minerals. He suggests using virgin coconut oil for a more thorough treatment. Aside from replenishing moisture in your hair, both of these oils can help keep your scalp healthy due to their antimicrobial properties.
Color-treated hair
: In general, rich treatment oils like shea butter oil are ideal for color-treated hair because they provide deep hydration to the strands and help to prevent breakage.
Hair growth
: Sweet almond oil and cedarwood oil are great for stimulating hair growth and nourishing your scalp and follicles.
Natural vs. Commercial Oils
They do not harm your health
: The first and most important point is that pure oils are completely safe for consumption. The majority of them are edible, so you don't have to worry about using them on your skin or hair. Commercial oils, on the other hand, contain a diverse range of chemical components, some of which are known to be dangerous and others of which the effects are unknown. Fragrances, preservatives, and stabilizers are all examples of common additives. These increase the product's shelf life and are easily absorbed by the skin. These have a short-term effect on skin irritation, but they can also cause chronic disorders such as cancer. The more chemical compounds the product has, the more likely it is to cause an allergic reaction.
They don’t have deceptive labels
: Have you seen how beautiful the commercial oil bottles are? The images of diverse plants and flowers, as well as exotic names such as 'Ethiopian', 'Moroccan', and 'Jamaican', can captivate anyone. You're told the bottle contains a certain type of oil or a combination of oils and herbs, but how much of this is true?
Pure oils do not contain silicones
:  The sample above demonstrated that what the label on the front claims is not entirely true, and the majority of the oil is an unknown substance. In most situations, this substance is composed of silicone. Silicones act to smooth the hair cuticle, giving it a silky smooth appearance and a sheen that diffuses light. This is also the primary component of many hair serums. Conversely, silicones tend to build up in the hair, so the longer you use them, the more they accumulate. Because they act as a barrier on top of the hair, they can trap dirt. Silicones are also notoriously difficult to remove, so you should avoid them in the first place.
Pure oils do not contain mineral oils
: Pure oils are extracted directly from nuts and seeds, so you know they contain only the natural plant ingredients. Commercial hair oils, on the other hand, frequently contain mineral oil, which accounts for a significant portion of the oil content. Mineral oil provides a smoothing effect, which is why it is used in commercial hair products. We've heard a lot about mineral makeup being a healthier option, which can lead many of us to believe mineral oil is also good. Unfortunately, mineral oil is a petrochemical made from petroleum. Now imagine doing that to your hair!
They nourish your hair more effectively
: Pure oils are naturally rich in important fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that may nourish hair from within. While all pure oils contain natural extracts that improve hair health in some way, each has unique qualities that provide specific advantages. Pure oils nourish both the scalp and the hair. They increase blood circulation in the scalp, which stimulates the follicles and encourages hair growth. It also works to prevent
dry scalp
and treat dandruff. Pure oils smooth, hydrate, and strengthen the hair, giving it a healthy gloss.
You can customize the oil to your advantage
: Commercial hair oils are frequently a combination of several oils and herbs, or so they claim. Because each oil or herb has unique benefits for the hair, mixing them can provide a balance of nutrients while also addressing a variety of hair concerns. However, because commercial oils contain such small amounts of these beneficial compounds, the overall benefit is minimal, if not nonexistent. When you buy your pure oils and herbs and combine them yourself, you know precisely what goes into your oil mix and can tailor it to your hair's specific needs. You don't have to worry about any undesired substances getting in, so you can reap the full benefits of employing a combination of oils and herbs.
Pure Oils work both before and after washing
: Commercial hair oils are typically applied after a wash or while styling damp hair. As previously stated, the silicones in the oils aid to smooth the hair cuticle. They are often lightweight for this purpose, but cannot be utilized for anything else. In contrast, pure oils can be used for almost any hair-related function. Oils such as coconut oil or olive oil permeate the hair well and are ideal for deep conditioning,
hair masks
, and other intensive hair treatments. Other oils, like as jojoba oil, grape seed oil, and argan oil, are lighter and ideal for styling or smoothing frizz.
Pure oils have long-term benefits
: Commercial hair oils provide quick relief from frizz and dullness. You can see how easy it is to untangle hair or smooth out frizz after using them. But wait a little, and you'll notice the benefits go away - that's how brief they last! Even commercial oils that claim to heal dandruff or reduce hair loss have only temporary results. Pure oils, on the other hand, work their way down to the deepest layer, resolving the issue from the inside out. You'll discover that pure oils don't produce immediate results. The benefits take time to manifest, but they are long-lasting and real.
They are better for the environment
: Commercial hair oils are also harmful to the environment due to the presence of numerous undisclosed ingredients. When you wash your hair after using a commercial oil, you are flushing all of those chemicals down the drain, where they become mixed with our soil and water. Such oils are also manufactured using unsustainable processes. Pure oils are taken directly from plants and include no additives. This ensures that they are safe for both you and the environment. There is no risk of soil or water contamination with them.
DIY Hair Oil Recipes for the Rainy Season
Some DIY options:
Banana and coconut oil
: Warm the coconut oil and mash a ripe banana together to make a hair pack. Apply it to your hair, focusing on the ends rather than the roots. Leave it on for 30 minutes to an hour, then rinse with plain water. Use a gentle shampoo to thoroughly rinse. According to the expert, using this hair pack regularly throughout the monsoon season can help minimize frizz, boost shine, and encourage healthy hair development.
Aloe vera gel, lemon, and tea tree essential oil
: Combine freshly extracted aloe vera gel, one teaspoon of lemon juice, and three to four drops of tea tree essential oil.

The natural oils in avocados can permeate the hair shaft and moisturize and nourish the hair, making it silky, lustrous, and manageable.

Effective Hair Oiling Techniques
Massaging your scalp and hair improves blood circulation, which promotes hair growth. Follow the steps outlined below to properly oil your hair.
Select the appropriate carrier oil
:  Carrier oils may be used alone or in conjunction with essential oils. Some commonly used carrier oils include coconut oil, jojoba oil, grapeseed, olive, almond, and avocado oil. If you have a greasy scalp, use light oils such as grapeseed or almond.
Select your essential oil
: Choose an essential oil based on its properties, as well as your hair type and needs. Essential oils such as peppermint, lavender, and sandalwood must be diluted in carrier oils because they can be too potent and cause allergic reactions. To dilute any essential oil by 2.5%, use 15 drops per 6 teaspoons of carrier oil.
Heat the oil
: Heat the oils for a few seconds until they are warm. Warm oil allows for deeper penetration through your hair cuticles and seals them, keeping your scalp moisturized.
Massage your scalp
: Massage the oil into your scalp for a few minutes in circular motions. Work your way through the entire scalp for 10-15 minutes. After you have finished with the scalp, gently work your way to the ends of your hair.
Wrap your hair in a warm cloth
: Tie your hair into a bun and wrap a warm cloth around your brow. This won't
clog pores
and cuticles, allowing the oils to penetrate deeper into your scalp and hair follicles.
Rinse it off thoroughly
: After applying your oil, leave it on overnight before thoroughly washing it off with shampoo the following day. Rinse your hair with either regular or cold water.
How to Apply Hair Oil Correctly
Apply hair oil from the mid-lengths to the ends of your hair as a pre-shampoo treatment, leaving it on for 5-10 minutes before shampooing, conditioning, and styling as usual. You can also oil your hair the night before you wash it to let the oil work its magic overnight.
Scalp Massage Benefits
Benefits of massaging your scalp include:
Promotes hair growth
: Scalp massage can increase blood flow to the hair follicles, delivering nutrients and oxygen to the roots and stimulating hair growth.
Reduce stress and tension
: A scalp massage can help to relax the muscles in the head, neck, and shoulders, reducing anxiety and stress.
Improves mood
: Scalp massage can increase the release of endorphins, which are natural mood boosters that can help with anxiety and depression.
Improves circulation
: Scalp massage can increase blood circulation throughout the body, improving overall health and well-being.
Helps with headaches
: Scalp massage can help relieve tension and migraine headaches in some cases.
Eliminates toxins
: Scalp massage can help to remove toxins and dead skin cells from the scalp, resulting in healthier hair growth.
Improves sleep quality
: Scalp massage can help promote relaxation and reduce stress, resulting in better sleep.
Frequency of Oiling in Monsoon
With increased hair fall during the monsoon season, you must oil your hair twice a week to ensure that it receives the proper amount of nourishment and strength. However, do not leave your hair oiled overnight because it might cause excessive sebum production; instead, use a moderate shampoo to remove it.
Additional Monsoon Hair Care Tips
To see results, strictly adhere to the hair care tips listed below.
Maintain a Balanced Diet
: One of the most important pieces of advice for monsoon hair is to eat a balanced diet. This should consist of a healthy mix of fresh fruits and leafy vegetables, as well as nuts, dairy, and eggs. You should also consume enough water to keep your body nourished. This will help keep your hair and skin hydrated.
Keep Your Hair Dry
: During the monsoon season, the humidity is high enough to make your hair appear lifeless and worn out. As a result, during the rainy season, you should take extra precautions when caring for your hair. Wash your hair regularly, but do not leave it damp for too long. You can dry your hair with a soft towel and then let it air dry. It is also advisable by trichologists and
dermatologists
not to tie your hair tightly after washing it to prevent hair loss.
Rejuvenate with a Hair Spa
: One of the best hair care tips for the monsoon season is to visit a hair spa. Hair spas during the monsoon season rejuvenate your scalp and hair, keeping them healthy. It leaves your hair looking nourished and hydrated.
Choose a New Hairstyle
: While caring for your hair during the rainy season, consider a monsoon haircut. Going short is a great idea this season because it prevents excess moisture from accumulating in your head and hair. You may also achieve an easy monsoon hairstyle by simply clipping your ends to minimize hair loss and broken ends.
Revamp Your Hair Care Routine
: Every season requires a different set of hair care tips. As a result, you should change your hair care products regularly. We recommend using products that are mild on your scalp and hair and provide moisturizing effects to help your hair feel lighter with each wash.
Post-Oiling Hair Care Routine
Don't use any shampoo once you've oiled your hair. Make sure to use a clarifying shampoo that completely cleanses your scalp and removes unnecessary oil buildup. If you're not sure what shampoo to use, choose a sulfate-free option that won't deplete your hair's natural oils.
Protecting Hair from Humidity
As a result, look for products with labels like "smoothing," "anti-frizz," "humidity-proof," and so on, and keep them on hand. Apply an anti-frizz serum or lotion to wringing wet hair. This provides additional moisture and may assist the product to better penetrate the hair cuticle.
Combining Oiling with Other Hair Care Practices
Hair oiling is the process of applying a generous amount of oil from the root to the lengths of the hair while it is wet to help seal in moisture and provide a protective barrier against environmental stressors. Those with thicker, more coarse hair can also apply it to dry hair for an extra boost of hydration.
