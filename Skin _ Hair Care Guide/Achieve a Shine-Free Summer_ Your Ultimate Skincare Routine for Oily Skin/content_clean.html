<h2><strong>Understanding Oily Skin and Its Summer Challenges</strong></h2>
<p><img alt="Why is my skin oily in summer?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Conclusion_99a99710-fb8f-41a2-a5fa-9eca3b1a83bf_480x480.png?v=1687865440"/></p>
<p><span>A prevalent skin type, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/cleansers">oily skin</a> is defined by excessive sebum production. The sebaceous glands in the skin create sebum, an oily material. Sebum is necessary to preserve and moisturise the skin, but too much of it can result in oily skin. Due to the higher temperatures and humidity throughout the summer, those with oily skin may experience some particular difficulties. Here are some essential details concerning oily skin and its difficulties throughout the summer:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Sebum production</b><span>: Oily skin produces more sebum than normal or dry skin. Summer heat and humidity can increase sebum production, making the skin even oilier.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Increased shine</b><span>: Excess sebum on the skin's surface can give the appearance of being shiny or greasy.  This shine can be more noticeable during summer due to perspiration and humidity.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Acne and breakouts</b><span>: Acne and breakouts are more common in oily skin. When excess sebum combines with dead skin cells and clogs the pores, it can result in the formation of blackheads, whiteheads, pimples, or even more severe forms of acne. Sweat and sebum can mix in the summer, contributing to <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/open-clogged-pores">clogged pores</a> and breakouts.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sun protection issues</b><span>: People with oily skin may have difficulty applying sunscreen and other sun protection products. Some sunscreens can make the skin feel heavy or greasy, exacerbating the oily sensation. However, using lightweight, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/non-comedogenic-skincare-products">non-comedogenic</a>, and oil-free sunscreen products to protect oily skin from harmful UV rays is critical.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Makeup longevity</b><span>: When it comes to makeup, oily skin can make it difficult for it to stay in place during hot and humid weather. Makeup may smear, melt, or appear uneven as a result of the excess oil. Setting sprays or powders can help prolong the wear of makeup by combining them with long-lasting, oil-free makeup products.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydration balance</b><span>: Even though oily skin produces excessive sebum, it still requires adequate hydration. The skin may lose moisture due to excessive sweating in hot weather.  Sebum production may increase in response to dehydration of the skin as a protective mechanism. Utilising thin, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/moisturisers">oil-free moisturisers</a> and getting enough water is crucial for maintaining a balance.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cleansing routine</b><span>: Proper cleansing is essential for oily skin management. During the summer, it's best to cleanse the face twice a day with a gentle, oil-free cleanser to remove excess oil, dirt, and impurities. Excessive or harsh cleansing can strip the skin, causing it to produce more sebum.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>The Science Behind Oily Skin and Sebum Production</b></h3>
<p><b><img alt="Why is my skin oily in summer?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Skincare_Routine_for_Malassezia_Biofilm_8c60c619-93e6-4def-9b15-56ab764fecd6_480x480.png?v=1687865507"/></b></p>
<p><span>Genetics, hormones, and environmental factors are just a few of the variables that have an impact on oily skin and sebum production. Why some people have oily skin and why sebum production might vary can be better understood by understanding the science underlying these processes.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Sebaceous glands</b><span>: Sebaceous glands are microscopic glands found within the skin that produce sebum. These glands are most common on the face, scalp, chest, and back. The size and activity of sebaceous glands are genetically determined, so some people naturally have larger, more active glands, which results in higher sebum production.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hormonal influences</b><span>: The production of sebum is significantly influenced by hormones. Androgens are male sex hormones that are also found in females, including testosterone. The sebaceous glands are stimulated by androgens to produce sebum. Acne and oily skin are prevalent during puberty because of the rise in androgen levels that occurs during this time.  Hormonal disorders or menstrual cycle-related hormonal imbalances can also affect sebum production and alter the oiliness of the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Composition of sebum</b><span>: Triglycerides, free fatty acids, wax esters, and cholesterol esters are all included in the complex mixture of lipids (fats) that make up sebum. Sebum composition varies between individuals, and changes in composition can affect the skin's overall oiliness as well as its properties, such as its ability to moisturise and protect the skin barrier.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Environmental factors</b><span>: The production of sebum can be affected by environmental factors like heat and humidity.  The sebaceous glands can produce more sebum when it is hot and humid outside, which results in oilier skin. This explains why many people experience more greasiness in the summer.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Feedback mechanisms</b><span>: The feedback mechanisms in the skin control the production of sebum. The sebaceous glands produce sebum, which travels to the skin's surface via the hair follicles. Once on the surface, sebum can interact with bacteria and other elements, setting off a chain reaction that may or may not have an impact on sebum production. For example, the presence of certain bacteria can cause inflammation, which in turn can influence sebum production.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Summer Effects: How Heat and Humidity Affect Oily Skin</b></h3>
<p><span>Heat and humidity can have a significant impact on oily skin, exacerbating its problems. Here's how certain weather conditions affect oily skin during the summer: </span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>The stimulation of the sebaceous glands by heat and humidity results in an increase in sebum production. The skin may produce more oil due to the hotter and more humid air, giving the impression that the skin is even more oily than usual.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>During hot and humid weather, the skin's surface may become shinier or greasier due to increased sebum production. Sweat and sebum when present together can intensify the shine on the face.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Oily skin is prone to clogged pores and acne, and summertime conditions can make these problems worse. Clogged pores can result from the combination of sebum, sweat, and environmental toxins, which in turn raises the risk of developing blackheads, whiteheads, pimples, or more severe acne breakouts.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Sweating is the body's natural way of cooling down, but it can mix with sebum on the surface of the skin. This combination may make the skin feel stickier and more prone to bacterial growth and pore congestion, which may result in breakouts.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Keeping makeup intact on oily skin can be difficult in hot and muggy weather. Makeup that is too oily may melt, smear, or appear uneven. Additionally, sweat can further reduce the longevity of makeup, necessitating touch-ups all day.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Potential skin irritants include the possibility of bacterial and fungal growth due to the interaction of heat, humidity, sweat, and excessive sebum. In particular, in areas of skin folds or where sweat collects, this may cause skin irritations like heat rash or fungal infections.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The importance of shielding oily skin from the sun's damaging UV rays cannot be overstated, but some sunscreens can feel greasy or heavy on the skin. This can be particularly bothersome for individuals with oily skin who may already struggle with excess oiliness. Look for lightweight, oil-free, and non-comedogenic sunscreen formulations to minimise any discomfort.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Take into account the following advice to lessen the effects of heat and humidity on oily skin during the summer:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>To get rid of extra oil, perspiration, and impurities, cleanse the skin twice daily with a mild, oil-free cleanser.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>To keep the skin hydrated without adding too much oil, use thin, non-comedogenic moisturisers.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a low oil content that is formulated for oily or acne-prone skin to protect against UV rays.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>To manage shine throughout the day, use blotting papers or sheets that can absorb oil.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Opt for long-lasting, waterproof, and oil-free makeup products that are designed specifically for oily skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Avoid using occlusive, heavy skincare products that can clog pores even more.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>To help keep the skin's moisture balance, stay hydrated by drinking enough water.  </span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Common Oily Skin Concerns in the Summer Months</b></h3>
<p><span>Due to the summer's heat, humidity, and increased sebum production, people with oily skin frequently experience certain problems. Here are some typical issues with oily skin during this season:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Excessive Oiliness</b><span>: In hot and humid weather, oily skin tends to get even oilier.  Heat and humidity cause the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum, which gives the surface of the skin a greasy or shiny appearance.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Breakouts and Acne</b><span>: Because oily skin produces more sebum and has clogged pores, it is more likely to experience breakouts and acne.  As a result of the interaction between sweat, oil, and environmental pollutants, blackheads, whiteheads, pimples, or more severe acne lesions may appear.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Clogged Pores</b><span>: The increased heat and humidity may cause the skin's pores to enlarge, making them more susceptible to becoming clogged with sebum, dead skin cells, and other impurities. This may lead to acne flare-ups and the growth of comedones (such as blackheads and whiteheads).</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Shine and Makeup Melting</b><span>: Excessive oiliness can leave the skin's surface with a persistent shine. It can also be difficult to maintain a matte appearance throughout the day due to the heat and humidity, which can make it easier for makeup to melt off the face or slide off.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skin Inflammation and Irritation</b><span>: The interaction of bacteria, sweat, and oil on the skin can result in skin irritation and inflammation. This may cause skin conditions like heat rash or aggravate pre-existing ones like acne or eczema.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Challenges with sun protection</b><span>: Finding an appropriate sunscreen for oily skin can be difficult. Some sunscreens may feel heavy or greasy, or they may clog pores, which can cause more breakouts. However, it's essential to use lightweight, oil-free, and non-comedogenic sunscreen formulations to shield oily skin from UV deterioration.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Dehydration and Unbalanced Moisture</b><span>: Even while oily skin overproduces sebum, it still requires adequate hydration. In the summer, the sebaceous glands may produce more oil in an effort to compensate for fluid loss brought on by dehydration brought on by exposure to the sun and heat.  Keeping the balance requires drinking enough water and applying lightweight, non-greasy moisturisers.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It is advised to stick to an oily skin-specific skincare regimen that includes oil-free and non-comedogenic products to address these issues. Utilising treatments containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide on a regular basis can help regulate excess oil, clear pores, and prevent breakouts. Additionally, using blotting papers, mattifying primers, or setting powders will help you keep shine under control and maintain the longevity of your makeup. Sunscreen is essential, and it's important to pick products with <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-sunprotect-sunscreen-spf-50">SPF protection</a> that are lightweight, oil-free, and non-greasy.</span></p>
<p><span>It's always advantageous to speak with a dermatologist or skincare expert who can offer individualised guidance and suggest suitable products or treatments to address your particular oily skin troubles during the summer.</span></p>

</li>
<li>
<p><span>When exposed to the sun, pick a lightweight formula with an SPF of 30 or higher, and reapply every 2 hours.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<b>Weekly Masks</b><span>:</span>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Use a face mask designed for oily skin once a week to deep clean, regulate oil production, and refine the pores.</span></p>
</li>

<p><span>Eat a healthy, balanced diet, drink plenty of water, and control your stress levels because these things can affect how much oil your skin produces and how it looks overall.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p><span>When it comes to skincare, consistency is important. Give your skin some time to become used to new products or routines, and keep an eye on how it reacts. Always seek out individualised guidance and recommendations from a dermatologist if you have persistent or serious oily skin issues.</span></p>
<h3><b>Cleansing Strategies for Oily Skin: Say Goodbye to Grease</b></h3>
<p><span>Any skincare regimen must include cleansing, especially for oily skin. The proper cleansing techniques can aid in removing pollutants, controlling excess oil, and preserving a balanced complexion. Listed below are some efficient cleaning techniques for oily skin:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Use a Gentle Cleanser</b><span>: Look for a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-foaming-face-wash">gentle cleanser</a> that is oil-free and designed especially for oily skin. Avoid using harsh cleansers that might strip the skin and possibly cause the body to produce more oil as a response.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Double Cleanse</b><span>: Take into account using the double cleansing technique, particularly if you use sunscreen or wear makeup. To dissolve and eliminate oil-based impurities, start with micellar water or an oil-based cleanser.  To thoroughly cleanse the skin, use a water-based cleanser after the first.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid Using Hot Water</b><span>: Using hot water to cleanse the skin may be alluring, but doing so can strip the skin of its natural oils and even encourage the production of more. Instead, use lukewarm water to avoid becoming overly dry or greasy. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Gentle Massage</b><span>: Use your fingertips to gently scrub your face in circular strokes. To avoid irritating your skin and possibly worsening oil production, avoid rubbing or being overly vigorous.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Rinse Completely</b><span>: After cleansing, thoroughly rinse your face with warm water. Clogged pores and breakouts can result from a leftover cleanser that has been left on the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Pat Dry</b><span>: To prevent irritation and reduce the chance of bacterial or excessive oil spread, gently pat your skin dry rather than rubbing it with a towel.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid over-cleansing</b><span>: While keeping your skin clean is important, doing so excessively can strip the skin of its natural oils and possibly result in rebound oiliness. Unless a dermatologist advises otherwise, keep cleansing twice daily, in the morning and evening.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consider Using Cleaning Brushes or Tool</b><span>s: For oily skin, silicone or electric cleansing brushes can offer a deeper clean. However, use them sparingly and with care, as excessive use or rough scrubbing can irritate the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Don't Forget the Neck</b><span>: Since problems with oily skin can extend beyond the face, extend your cleansing routine to the neck as well.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Adjust the Frequency of Cleansing</b><span>: Depending on the needs of your skin, you may find that twice-daily cleansing is adequate or that you need to cleanse more frequently, especially if you sweat a lot or participate in activities that cause excessive oil production.  Keep an eye on how your skin reacts and modify your cleansing procedure as necessary.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Pore Care and Oil Control: Keeping Skin Fresh and Clear</b></h3>
<p><span>Keeping oily skin clean, and transparent, and minimising the appearance of enlarged pores requires proper pore care and oil control. To address these issues, incorporate the following techniques into your skincare routine:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Exfoliation</b><span>: Exfoliating on a regular basis helps to remove dead skin cells, clear clogged pores, and stop the accumulation of extra oil and impurities.  Choose chemical exfoliants that can effectively dissolve oil and debris because they can penetrate pores and contain ingredients like salicylic acid or glycolic acid.  To prevent over-exfoliation, use exfoliating products two to three times per week.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Clay masks</b><span>:<a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/overnight-face-masks-in-your-skincare-routine"> Clay masks</a> are good for oily skin because they can remove impurities and extra oil from the epidermis. Look for masks with kaolin clay, bentonite clay, or charcoal as the main ingredients.  Apply a clay mask once a week or more frequently as necessary to reduce oiliness and improve the look of pores.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Oil-Free and Non-Comedogenic Skincare</b><span>: Look for products that are oil-free and non-comedogenic, which means they won't clog your pores.  This includes cleansers, moisturisers, sunscreens, and makeup.  These products are designed to provide hydration and other benefits to the skin without adding extra oil. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Mattifying Products</b><span>: Look for mattifying products to help control excess shine throughout the day. Mattifying primers, powders, and oil-absorbing sheets can aid in the absorption of oil and the reduction of shine on the skin's surface.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Toners for Oily Skin</b><span>: Use a toner designed specifically for oily skin to help balance oil production and tighten pores. Toners with astringent and clarifying properties, such as witch hazel or tea tree oil, should be avoided.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Keep Away from Heavy or Occlusive Products</b><span>: Heavy creams and occlusive products can clog pores and make oiliness worse. Instead, choose hydrating serums and lightweight moisturisers that absorb quickly and don't leave a greasy aftertaste on the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Blotting Papers</b><span>: Keep blotting papers close at hand all day to quickly absorb extra oil and lessen skin shine. To remove excess oil without removing makeup, gently press the blotting paper onto areas of oiliness, such as the forehead, nose, and chin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consistent Cleaning</b><span>: Maintain a daily cleansing schedule that includes washing your face in the morning and evening. This lessens pore congestion by removing extra oil, dirt, and impurities from the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydration and Moisture Balance</b><span>: While oily skin requires oil control, it is also critical to maintain proper hydration. Dehydrated skin can cause the sebaceous glands to produce more oil as a compensatory response. To keep your skin balanced and hydrated, use lightweight, oil-free moisturisers or hydrating serums.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sun Protection</b><span>: Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen to shield your skin from the sun's harmful UV rays. To avoid clogging the pores, look for oil-free and non-comedogenic formulations. UV rays can aggravate oily skin and contribute to pore enlargement.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<div></div>

<p><b>Utilise a Mattifying Primer</b><span>: To create a matte, shine-free base before applying makeup, use a mattifying primer. This can reduce oil production and lengthen the time that your makeup lasts.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Wear Oil-Free and Non-Comedogenic Sunscreen</b><span>: Cover your skin with an oil-free and non-comedogenic sunscreen to shield it from the sun's harmful UV rays. Select a water-resistant formula with an SPF of at least 30, and reapply as necessary.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid Heavy Makeup</b><span>: In the summer, choose products that are lightweight and free of oil. Heavy foundations and creamy formulas can clog pores and cause breakouts. For a lighter feel, opt for powder or mineral makeup.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Exfoliate on a regular basis</b><span>: Exfoliation helps remove dead skin cells and unclog pores. To prevent buildup and control oil production, use gentle chemical exfoliants such as salicylic acid or glycolic acid.  However, excessive exfoliation can cause irritation and excess oil production.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydrate from Within</b><span>: Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Proper hydration can help regulate oil production and maintain the overall health of your skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid Touching Your Face</b><span>: Touching your face with your hands can transfer oils and dirt, potentially exacerbating oiliness and causing breakouts. Be mindful of touching your face and try to avoid it as much as possible.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use a Weekly Purifying Mask</b><span>: Incorporate a weekly purifying mask into your skincare routine to deep cleanse and draw out impurities. Look for masks containing ingredients like clay, charcoal, or sulphur, which can absorb excess oil and unclog pores.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Adjust Your Diet</b><span>: While diet alone may not directly impact oil production, certain foods can trigger inflammation and worsen skin conditions. Opt for a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins to support overall skin health.</span></p>
</li>

<h3><b>Makeup Tips and Products for Shine-Free Skin</b></h3>
<p><span>There are various tricks and items you can use in your routine to get makeup-covered skin without shine. Here are some suggestions for products and makeup techniques to help you attain a shine-free appearance:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Prepare Your Skin</b><span>: Begin with a clean, moisturised face. To hydrate your skin without adding additional oil, use a lightweight, oil-free moisturiser.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use a Mattifying Primer</b><span>: Before applying foundation, use a mattifying primer. This will provide a smooth base and aid in oil control throughout the day.  Look for primers designed specifically for oily skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Choose an Oil-Free Foundation</b><span>: Choose an oil-free, matte, or powder foundation.  These formulations aid in the absorption of excess oil while also providing a long-lasting, shine-free finish. Consider mineral or powder foundations for a lighter feel. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Set Your Foundation</b><span>: Use a translucent powder or a mattifying powder to set your foundation after you've applied it. This will help absorb any remaining oil and leave your skin matte. Concentrate on the T-zone and any other areas prone to shine.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Blotting Papers</b><span>: Keep oil-absorbing blotting papers on hand at all times. Gently press the blotting paper onto oily areas to absorb excess oil while leaving your makeup intact. This will help control shine without the need for additional product on your face.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Apply an Oil-Controlled Setting Spray</b><span>: To finish your makeup, use an oil-controlled setting spray. These sprays aid in the sealing of makeup, the control of shine, and the extension of its wear time.  Look for setting sprays with oil-controlling or mattifying properties.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use Light Cream Products Instead</b><span>: Cream-based products can increase shine and oiliness. Use blushes, bronzers, and eyeshadows instead, which are powder-based cosmetics. On oily skin, powder formulas stay matter and longer.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Long-Wearing or Waterproof Formulas</b><span>: For your eye makeup, such as mascara and eyeliner, select products that are waterproof or long-lasting. Even in the presence of excess oil, these formulations are less likely to smudge or transfer.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid Excessive Highlighting</b><span>: While highlighting can add a lovely glow, it can also accentuate the shine of oily skin. Choose a lighter highlighter or concentrate on areas that are less prone to oiliness, such as the high points of the cheeks, brow bone, or inner corners of the eyes.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Carry Oil-Control Products</b><span>: Keep a small touch-up kit on hand for shine control on the go. To refresh your makeup throughout the day, include blotting papers, a small powder compact, and a travel-sized setting spray.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>

Keep in mind that every individual has a different type of skin, so what suits one person may not suit another. Finding the ideal non-comedogenic products for your skin may take some trial and error. Be patient and watchful of how your skin responds to various formulations, and modify your skincare regimen as necessary.</span></p>
<h2><b>Expert Advice: Dermatologists' Insights on Oily Skin in Summer</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="Why is my skin oily in summer?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Causes_of_Dehydrated_skin_eea71f6e-86cd-45e8-ae76-a4b1823ac187_480x480.png?v=1687865688"/></b></p>
<p><span>Dermatologists offer insightful information and professional guidance on how to treat oily skin throughout the summer. Here are some of the top suggestions dermatologists have for managing oily skin in the summer:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Gently cleanse</b><span>: Dermatologists recommend cleansing oily skin twice a day to remove excess oil, sweat, and debris. They do, however, advise using a gentle cleanser designed for oily skin to avoid stripping the skin's natural oils, which can result in rebound oil production.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use oil-free, lightweight products</b><span>: Choose oil-free, lightweight moisturisers, serums, and sunscreens.  Dermatologists advise using non-comedogenic products to avoid breakouts and clogged pores.  Look for labels that mention formulations that are specifically oil-free or non-comedogenic.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Don't skip the moisturiser</b><span>: In spite of what many people think, even oily skin needs to be hydrated. Dermatologists advise using a light moisturiser that is free of oils to keep the skin's moisture balance. Hydrated skin can aid in controlling oil production and preventing overproduction of sebum.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Every day, apply sunscreen</b><span>: Everyone, even those with oily skin, needs to protect themselves from the sun. Dermatologists recommend utilising a broad-spectrum, oil-free sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to shield your skin from damaging UV rays. Look for formulas that are breathable, non-greasy, and lightweight.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Blotting papers and powders</b><span>: To reduce shine throughout the day, dermatologists advise using oil-absorbing blotting papers or powders.  Oil-absorbing powders can help mattify the skin and reduce shine, while blotting papers can quickly absorb surface oil without removing your makeup.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Exfoliation should be done with caution</b><span>: While exfoliation is good for oily skin, dermatologists advise against overdoing it, especially in the summer.  Excessive exfoliation can irritate the skin and increase the production of oil. Use chemical exfoliants like salicylic acid or glycolic acid only once or twice a week for gentle exfoliation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Choose breathable fabrics</b><span>: To help absorb perspiration and avoid pore congestion, dermatologists advise wearing breathable textiles, such as cotton. Avoid wearing clothing or other synthetic fabrics that are too tight because they can trap heat and moisture against the skin, making it more oily.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid heavy makeup</b><span>: Dermatologists advise against wearing heavy, oil-based makeup during the summer because it can clog pores and cause breakouts. To allow your skin to breathe, choose makeup that is lightweight, oil-free, and non-comedogenic.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Stay hydrated</b><span>: Hydration is essential for overall skin health, including oily skin. Dermatologists recommend drinking plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated. Hydration is important for balancing oil production and keeping your skin looking and feeling healthy.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consider professional treatments</b><span>: Dermatologists may recommend professional treatments such as chemical peels, microdermabrasion, or laser therapies for people who have severe oily skin problems. These treatments can help control oil production, unclog pores, and improve skin appearance. Consult a dermatologist to determine the best treatment options for your specific needs.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It's important to remember that everyone's skin is different, so what works for one person might not work for another. It's best to seek assistance from a dermatologist if you have persistent or serious oily skin issues so that they can make personalised suggestions and directions specific to your skin's requirements.</span></p>
