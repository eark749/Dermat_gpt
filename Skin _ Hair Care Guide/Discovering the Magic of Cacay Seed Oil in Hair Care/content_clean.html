<ol>
<li>
<b>Essential Fatty Acids</b><span>: Omega-6 fatty acids (linoleic acid) contribute to the skin's barrier function, preventing moisture loss and promoting hydration. They also have anti-inflammatory properties, which make them useful for treating irritated skin and scalp. Oleic acid, an omega-9 fatty acid, is known for its moisturising properties, which help to soften and hydrate skin and hair. It also has emollient properties that can help improve the texture and appearance of your hair.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Vitamin E</b><span>:</span> <span>Vitamin E, a potent antioxidant that shields the skin and hair from free radical damage brought on by environmental stresses like pollution and UV rays, is abundant in cacao seed oil. Additionally, vitamin E stimulates healthy hair growth by feeding the hair follicles and enhancing blood circulation to the scalp.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Vitamin A</b><span>:</span> <span>Another antioxidant that supports healthy skin and hair is vitamin A, which is also present in cacay seed oil. It supports the ideal circumstances for hair growth by assisting in the maintenance of a healthy scalp and hair follicles.
