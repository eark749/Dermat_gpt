The use of rice water for skin and face has been a popular practice in some cultures for centuries, and there is some evidence to support its benefits. Rice water is the starchy liquid that is leftover after soaking or boiling rice. It is rich in vitamins, minerals, and
antioxidants
, and has been used for its skin-nourishing and brightening properties. Research suggests that rice water has anti-inflammatory properties that can help to soothe and reduce skin redness, as well as antioxidant properties that can help to protect the skin from environmental stressors. It also contains
ferulic acid

Additionally, using rice water excessively or in high concentrations may lead to skin irritation, so it is important to use it in moderation and patch test before applying it to the entire face.
Overall, while rice water may have some benefits for the skin, it is not a substitute for a healthy skincare routine that includes sun protection, gentle cleansing, and moisturizing.

Best practices for applying rice water
To achieve the best benefits and reduce the risk of irritation, follow these instructions while applying rice water to your skin. Here are some excellent practices for using rice water in your skincare routine:
Prepare Rice Water
: Begin by rinsing uncooked rice with water to eliminate contaminants and debris. Put the washed rice in a bowl and cover with water. Soak the rice for 15-30 minutes to release its beneficial nutrients into the water. After soaking, pour the rice water into a clean container to remove any rice grains.
Dilute if Necessary
: Depending on your skin sensitivity, you may need to dilute the rice water with fresh water to minimise its potency. This can help reduce the chance of irritation, particularly for those with sensitive skin.
Perform a Patch Test
: Before applying rice water to your face or sensitive regions, do a patch test. Apply a little amount of diluted rice water to a small region of your skin (such as the inner forearm) and wait 24-48 hours to see if there are any adverse responses.
Cleanse Your Skin
: Before applying rice water, ensure that your skin is clean and dry. Use a mild cleanser to remove debris, oil, and makeup from your skin.
Application Method
: Soak a cotton pad or cotton ball in diluted rice water and gently rub it on your face, avoiding the sensitive eye area. Transfer the diluted rice water to a clean spray bottle and spritz it on your face, keeping the bottle 6-8 inches away from your skin. Alternatively, soak a clean washcloth or cotton pads in diluted rice water and gently massage them against your skin for a few minutes before rinsing with lukewarm water.
Massage Gently
: If desired, gently massage the rice water into your skin in circular motions to improve absorption and circulation.
Leave on for a Few Minutes
: Allow the rice water to stay on your skin for a few minutes so that the skin may absorb its healthy properties. However, do not leave rice water on your skin for an extended amount of time, since this may raise the risk of irritation.
Rinse Thoroughly
: After a few minutes, properly rinse your skin with lukewarm water to remove any rice water. If necessary, follow up with a light cleanser to eliminate any remaining residue.
Moisturize
: After rinsing, use a moisturising and calming moisturiser to seal in moisture and restore the skin's moisture balance.
Monitor Skin's Response
: Pay attention to how your skin reacts to the rice water application. If you notice redness, itching, burning, or other signs of irritation, stop using the product right once and rinse your skin with water.

The duration and frequency of rice water application can vary depending on personal skin sensitivity, tolerance, and skincare goals. Here are some general suggestions for utilising rice water in your skincare routine:
Before integrating rice water into your skincare routine, do a patch test to see how your skin reacts. Apply a small amount of diluted rice water to a small region of your skin (such as the inner forearm) and wait 24-48 hours to see if there are any adverse responses. If you have redness, itching, or irritation, don't use rice water on your face.

However, avoid over-exfoliation or excessive use, since this can cause skin irritation and sensitivity.
When applying rice water to your skin, keep it on for a few minutes to let the skin absorb its healthy properties.

After a few minutes, rinse the rice water with lukewarm water and use a moisturiser to seal in the moisture.
Pay special attention to how your skin reacts to the rice water application. If you notice redness, itching, burning, or other signs of irritation, stop using the product right once and rinse your skin with water. Apply a calming moisturiser to relax the skin and restore hydration.

If you have serious concerns about putting rice water on your skin, or if you are experiencing recurrent irritation or allergic reactions, see a dermatologist for personalised advice and recommendations.
