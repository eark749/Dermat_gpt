Zinc Absorption: Factors That Influence Bioavailability and Utilization
Zinc is a mineral that is needed for many biological functions in the body, including enzyme function, immune system support, DNA synthesis, and wound healing. However, a number of factors can affect the bioavailability and utilization of zinc. Some of the most significant factors affecting zinc absorption include the ones listed below:
Dietary Source
: The source from which zinc is obtained affects how much of it is bioavailable. In comparison to plant-based sources, animal-based sources like meat and seafood offer highly bioavailable forms of zinc. Phytates (phytic acid), which are found in plant-based sources like grains and legumes, can bind to zinc and prevent its absorption.
Phytates
: As was already mentioned, phytates found in plant-based foods can bind to zinc and reduce its solubility and bioavailability. Phytate levels can be decreased and zinc absorption from plant-based foods can be increased by soaking, sprouting, fermenting, and cooking.
Dietary Fibre
: A high intake of dietary fibre, especially from sources like bran, can reduce the absorption of zinc. This is because fibre can bind to zinc and prevent the gut from absorbing zinc.
Iron and copper
: High levels of dietary iron and copper can compete with zinc for intestinal absorption. Excessive consumption of these minerals, particularly in supplement form, may impair zinc absorption.
Calcium
: When consumed in large quantities at once, calcium can also prevent the absorption of zinc. It is best to steer clear of consuming calcium-rich foods or supplements at the same time as those that contain zinc.
Pharmacological Agents
: A number of prescription drugs and health issues may interfere with the absorption of zinc.  For instance, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may reduce the digestive tract's ability to absorb zinc.
Age and Life Stage
: Due to growth and development, infants, children, and adolescents have higher zinc needs. Additionally, practices like breastfeeding and weaning can affect zinc bioavailability.
Zinc Status
: Depending on its current zinc status, the body controls how much zinc is absorbed. Both absorption and zinc levels may rise when zinc levels are low.
Gastrointestinal Health
: Disorders that affect the gastrointestinal tract, such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and other malabsorption disorders, can lessen zinc absorption.
Genetics
: Genetic variations can affect how efficiently the body absorbs and uses zinc.
