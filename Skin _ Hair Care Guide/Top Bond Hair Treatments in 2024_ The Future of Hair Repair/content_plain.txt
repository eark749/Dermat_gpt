The Science Behind Hair Restoration
Hair restoration involves several scientific principles related to hair growth biology, the hair cycle, and hair loss mechanisms. Here's a rundown of the science behind hair restoration:
Hair Growth Cycle
:
Anagen Phase
: The active growth phase during which hair follicles produce new hair. The duration of this phase varies from person to person.
Catagen Phase
: A transitional period in which hair ceases to grow and detaches from the blood supply.
Telogen Phase
: Also known as the resting phase, this is the period during which the hair follicle remains dormant before shedding and making way for new hair.
Causes of Hair Loss
:
Androgenetic Alopecia
: A genetic condition that causes
male and female hair loss
or baldness.
Telogen Effluvium
: Stress, disease, hormonal fluctuations, or dietary inadequacies can all contribute to excessive shedding.
Alopecia Areata
: Alopecia Areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes patchy hair loss.
Medical Conditions
: Certain illnesses, medications, or treatments, such as chemotherapy, can cause hair loss.
Medications (such as minoxidil and finasteride), Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy, Hair Transplant Surgery (such as Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) or Strip Harvesting and Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE)), and Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) are examples of scientific treatments for hair restoration.
Consultation with a dermatologist
or hair restoration specialist can assist in determining the best treatment for an individual's condition and needs.
Understanding the Mechanics of Hair Bond Repair
The bonds that comprise the structure of hair are reinforced and rebuilt during hair bond repair. Stressors in the environment, chemical treatments, or heat styling may have weakened these connections. An overview of how hair bond repair operates is provided below:
Disulfide Bonds
: Disulfide bonds are strong chemical bonds that give hair structure and strength. Chemical processes such as bleaching or perming can break them down.
Hydrogen Bonds
: Weaker bonds that help hair retain its elasticity and flexibility. Heat styling can be used to temporarily break these bonds.
Understanding the mechanics of hair bond repair aids in the selection of appropriate treatments and products to effectively restore and strengthen damaged hair. It is critical to follow product instructions and, in some cases, seek professional advice for the best results.
