<p><span>Androgenetic alopecia, also known as male or female pattern baldness, is a common type of hair loss that affects millions of people worldwide. While it is more commonly associated with men, women can also experience androgenetic alopecia. In this article, we will discuss the causes, treatments, and home remedies for androgenetic alopecia.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Understanding Androgenetic Alopecia</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img alt="androgenetic alopecia " src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/What_is_Scalp_Psoriasis_480x480.png?v=1682401371"/></strong></p>
<p><span>Androgenetic alopecia is a genetic and hormonal condition that affects hair follicles, leading to hair loss. Hair follicles become sensitive to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that causes the hair follicles to shrink and weaken. This eventually leads to hair loss. Androgenetic alopecia is commonly divided into two types: male and female pattern hair loss.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Male Androgenetic Alopecia (Male Pattern Hair Loss)</strong></h3>
<p><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/male-pattern-baldness-causes-symptoms-and-treatments">Male pattern hair loss</a> is a common condition that affects more than 50% of men over the age of 50. It typically begins with a receding hairline and thinning on the crown of the head. Over time, hair loss can progress, leading to partial or complete baldness. Male pattern hair loss is primarily caused by genetic factors and hormones.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Female Androgenetic Alopecia (Female Pattern Baldness)</strong></h3>
<p><span>Female pattern baldness is a type of androgenetic alopecia that affects women. It is less common than male pattern hair loss and typically occurs after menopause. Female pattern baldness causes a diffuse thinning of hair on the crown of the head, which can eventually lead to baldness.</span></p>

<p><span>Several factors contribute to the development of androgenetic alopecia, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Genetics</strong>: A family history of androgenetic alopecia can increase the likelihood of developing the condition.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Hormones</strong>: Androgenetic alopecia is caused by the sensitivity of hair follicles to DHT, a hormone that is produced in the body. Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause, can trigger or exacerbate hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Age</strong>: As people age, their hair follicles become more sensitive to DHT, leading to hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Medical conditions</strong>: Certain medical conditions, such as thyroid disorders and autoimmune diseases, can contribute to hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Medications</strong>: Some medications, such as chemotherapy drugs and blood thinners, can cause hair loss as a side effect.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
