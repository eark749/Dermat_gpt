Extreme hair loss, often known as excessive hair shedding or alopecia, can be upsetting and suggest underlying health problems. In this blog, we look at the causes, treatments, and prevention of hair loss.
Understanding Extreme Hair Fall
Alopecia, or
hair loss
, can affect the scalp or the entire body and be temporary or permanent. It could be caused by genetics, hormonal changes, medical problems, or the normal aging process. Anyone can lose hair, but men are more prone to it.
Identifying the Symptoms
Both men and women lose hair thickness and volume as they age. This type of
baldness
is typically not caused by an illness. It is associated with aging, heredity, and changes in the hormone testosterone. Inherited, or pattern baldness affects far more males than females.
Common Causes of Extreme Hair Fall
The fallout can be sudden or gradual.
Thins
It may regenerate on its own.
Requires surgery for regeneration.
Needs immediate care to prevent permanent hair loss.
Genetic Factors and Heredity
The vulnerability to
androgenetic alopecia
is inherited from one or both parents. While the exact inheritance pattern is difficult to determine, it is usually polygenic, meaning numerous genes contribute to the illness. This means that if one or both of your parents had pattern baldness, you are more likely to develop it.
DHT, a testosterone byproduct, attaches to androgen receptors in scalp hair follicles, causing them to miniaturize. Over time, the afflicted hair follicles generate thinner, shorter, and less pigmented hair, eventually ceasing hair development in specific parts of the scalp.
Hormonal Imbalances
Hormonal abnormalities can affect both men and women, causing hair to thin or fall out. Correcting the imbalance often promotes hair regrowth. Most people associate hormone imbalances with estrogen or testosterone, but thyroid disorders can also cause hair thinning.
Nutritional Deficiencies
Iron deficiency is one of the most common causes of hair loss, mainly among vegetarians and women with heavy periods. Iron is the raw ingredient for hemoglobin, a protein that transports oxygen throughout the body, including hair follicles.
Stress and Psychological Factors
Stress and psychological disorders significantly impact hair health, resulting in hair loss and thinning. Understanding how stress affects hair health and implementing proper management strategies can help you improve your mental and physical health. To support long-term hair health and well-being, incorporate stress-reduction techniques, seek psychological help, and lead a balanced lifestyle.
Medical Conditions and Medications
Topical Minoxidil
: Topical minoxidil inhibits hair thinning and promotes new
hair growth
. This medication can help people with many different types of hair loss, including male and female pattern hair loss, also known as androgenetic alopecia;
alopecia areata
, an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks healthy tissues, including the hair follicles; telogen effluvium, in which hair falls out all over the scalp due to an interruption in the body's cycle of hair production; and anagen effluvium, or rapid hair loss resulting from medical.
Oral Finasteride
: Oral finasteride is a prescription drug that treats male-pattern hair loss, also known as androgenetic alopecia. It reduces hair loss and promotes new hair growth by suppressing the body's synthesis of a hormone that destroys hair follicles. This drug is given orally once per day and works best when taken simultaneously every day.
Antiandrogens
: Female pattern baldness, also known as androgenetic alopecia, may be treated with medications that suppress androgens—sex hormones that damage or kill hair follicles—to prevent hair loss. Antiandrogen drugs, such as spironolactone and estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, are only available with a prescription. Antiandrogens typically begin to function after four months. Long-term treatment is required to prevent hair loss from reoccurring.
Corticosteroids
: Some types of hair loss are caused by an autoimmune condition and require a different treatment than hormonal hair loss. An autoimmune illness occurs when the immune system destroys healthy organs and tissues, including the skin. Occasionally, the body destroys healthy hair follicles. Corticosteroids treat alopecia areata, lichen planopilaris, and discoid lupus erythematosus. These immune system suppressors can alleviate the symptoms of an autoimmune condition, allowing hair to grow. Steroids are available as topical applications or injections, and they all require a prescription.
Dermatologists
determine the best treatment option based on your age and the severity of your symptoms.
Other Medications
