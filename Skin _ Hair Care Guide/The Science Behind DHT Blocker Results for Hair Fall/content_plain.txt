Dihydrotestosterone, commonly known as DHT, is a hormone that plays a crucial role in the development of male characteristics. However, excessive levels of DHT in both men and women can lead to hair loss and thinning. DHT attaches to hair follicles, causing them to shrink and eventually stop producing new hair growth. As a result, DHT has been identified as a major contributor to hair fall and hair loss in both genders.
In this article, we will explore the effects of DHT on hair and discuss various ways to control and reduce DHT levels. We'll also cover natural DHT blockers, DHT blocker foods, and ingredients that can help prevent hair fall due to DHT. Additionally, we will discuss the symptoms of high DHT levels in females and offer tips on how to remove DHT from the scalp. Whether you're experiencing hair loss due to DHT or simply looking to maintain healthy hair, this article is a must read.
What is DHT?
Dihydrotestosterone, or DHT for short, is a hormone that plays an important role in the development of male characteristics. DHT is synthesized from testosterone by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase and is more potent than testosterone itself. It is responsible for the growth and development of male reproductive organs and secondary sexual characteristics such as facial hair and deepening of the voice.
How to Treat Hair Loss Due to DHT
Hair loss due to DHT can be a frustrating and difficult problem to deal with, but there are ways to treat and prevent it. Here are some effective methods for treating
hair loss
due to DHT:
Use a DHT blocker:
DHT blockers
are substances that can reduce the production of DHT or prevent it from attaching to hair follicles. There are many natural DHT blockers available, such as saw palmetto, pumpkin seed oil, and green tea.
Take supplements:
Supplements
such as biotin, zinc, and vitamin D can help strengthen hair follicles and promote healthy hair growth.
Use hair growth products: Products that contain ingredients such as
minoxidil
and
ketoconazole
can promote hair growth and prevent DHT from damaging hair follicles.
Maintain a healthy diet: A diet rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals can help promote healthy hair growth and prevent hair loss due to DHT.
Does DHT Cause Hair Loss?
While DHT is important for male development, excessive levels of this hormone can cause hair loss and thinning. DHT attaches to hair follicles, causing them to shrink and eventually stop producing new hair growth. This process is known as miniaturization and is the main cause of
androgenetic alopecia
or
male pattern baldness
.
DHT can also contribute to hair loss and thinning in women, although the mechanism is not as well understood. Women have lower levels of DHT than men, but changes in hormone levels during menopause can increase DHT production, resulting in hair loss and thinning.
Stages of Hair Fall Due to DHT
The stages of hair fall due to DHT can vary from person to person but generally follow a similar pattern. Hair follicles go through three stages of growth: anagen, catagen, and telogen. During the anagen phase, hair grows actively, and this phase can last for several years. The catagen phase is a transition phase that lasts for a few weeks, during which
hair growth
slows down. Finally, the telogen phase is a resting phase that lasts for a few months, after which the hair falls out and a new anagen phase begins.
When DHT attaches to hair follicles, it shortens the anagen phase and prolongs the telogen phase. This means that hair falls out faster than it can grow back, leading to thinning and balding. The stages of hair fall due to DHT can be classified into the following:
Hair thinning:
The first sign of DHT related hair fall is usually
thinning
, especially around the crown and temples in men.
Receding hairline:
As the hair follicles shrink, the hairline can recede in a distinct "M" shape.
Balding:
With continued hair loss, the hairline recedes further, and the crown becomes noticeably thinner, eventually leading to
balding
.
In conclusion, DHT is a hormone that is important for male development, but excessive levels can cause hair loss and thinning in both men and women. Understanding the stages of
hair fall
due to DHT can help individuals identify the problem early and take steps to prevent or treat hair loss.
Tips to Control DHT-Induced Hair Loss
Hair loss due to DHT can be controlled and prevented with some simple lifestyle changes and treatments. Here are some effective tips to control DHT-induced hair loss:
Use DHT blockers: Use natural DHT blockers such as saw palmetto, pumpkin seed oil, and green tea to reduce the production of DHT or prevent it from attaching to hair follicles.
Maintain a healthy diet: A diet rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals can help promote healthy hair growth and prevent hair loss due to DHT.
Exercise regularly: Exercise can help improve blood circulation to the scalp, which is essential for healthy hair growth.
Avoid tight hairstyles: Avoid tight hairstyles that pull on the hair, as this can cause hair breakage and damage.

Dietary Changes to Reduce DHT Levels
Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a hormone that influences male characteristics. However, high DHT levels have been linked to a variety of health issues, including hair loss and prostate problems. While diet alone may not significantly lower DHT levels, some dietary changes may help to moderate its production indirectly. Here are some suggestions:
To support overall health, ensure that you consume a healthy balance of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).
While fats are required for hormone production, excessive consumption of saturated and trans fats may result in elevated DHT levels.  Focus on healthy fats such as avocados, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish.
Colourful fruits and vegetables are high in antioxidants and phytonutrients, which help to reduce inflammation and maintain hormonal balance.
Zinc is essential for regulating hormone levels, including DHT. Zinc-rich foods include oysters, beef, poultry, nuts, seeds, and legumes.
Protein is required for the production of many hormones, including DHT. Choose lean protein sources like chicken, fish, tofu, and legumes.
Chronic inflammation may cause hormonal imbalances. Include foods with anti-inflammatory properties, such as fatty fish (salmon, mackerel), turmeric, ginger, and green tea.
Green tea contains compounds such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which may help control DHT levels.
Excessive alcohol and caffeine consumption can disrupt hormonal balance, so consume them in moderation.
Drinking plenty of water promotes overall health and may indirectly regulate hormone levels.
Some herbs, such as saw palmetto and pumpkin seed extract, have been suggested to help regulate DHT levels, but research on their efficacy is mixed. Before adding supplements to your regimen, consult a healthcare professional.
Scalp Health and DHT
Scalp health is closely related to DHT levels, especially in the context of conditions such as male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia), in which DHT plays an important role. Here are some factors to consider when maintaining scalp health and managing DHT-related issues:
Keep the scalp clean
: Using a gentle shampoo regularly helps to remove excess oil, dead skin cells, and debris from the scalp, preventing clogged follicles and promoting a healthy environment for hair growth.
Use DHT-blocking shampoos
: Some shampoos contain ingredients such as ketoconazole or saw palmetto, which are thought to reduce DHT production or activity on the scalp.  These shampoos may help to reduce DHT levels and improve scalp health.
Consider scalp massages
: Massaging the scalp improves blood circulation, allowing essential nutrients to reach the hair follicles and promote overall scalp health.  Some research suggests that scalp massage may also help reduce DHT levels in the scalp tissue.
Avoid tight hairstyles and treatments
: Traction alopecia, which is caused by pulling on the hair follicles, can worsen hair loss.  Avoid hairstyles that pull on the scalp tightly and minimize the use of harsh chemical treatments that can damage the scalp and hair follicles.
Maintain a balanced diet
: As previously stated, a balanced diet high in essential nutrients promotes overall health, including scalp health.  Zinc, vitamins A and C, and omega-3 fatty acids are especially beneficial for healthy hair and scalps.
Stay hydrated
: Proper hydration is critical for the health of all bodily tissues, including your scalp.  Drinking plenty of water keeps the scalp hydrated and supports its role as a barrier against environmental stressors.
Manage stress
: Chronic stress can lead to hormonal imbalances, such as increased DHT levels, which can worsen hair loss.  Meditation, deep breathing exercises, and yoga are all stress-reduction techniques that can help improve scalp health and overall well-being.
Consult a healthcare professional
: If you have significant hair loss or scalp issues, you should see a
dermatologist
or a healthcare professional. They can offer personalised advice, diagnose any underlying conditions, and recommend appropriate treatments, such as medications or procedures, to address DHT-related scalp issues.
By incorporating these strategies into your daily routine, you can improve scalp health and effectively manage DHT-related issues.

The Role of Shampoos in DHT Blockage
Shampoos marketed as DHT blockers typically contain ingredients designed to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the scalp or to reduce DHT activity. While these shampoos may help reduce DHT levels on the scalp, their effectiveness varies, and they may not be a complete solution for managing DHT-related hair loss. Here's how shampoos affect DHT blockage:
Key Ingredients
: DHT-blocking shampoos frequently include active ingredients like ketoconazole, saw palmetto extract, caffeine, pyrithione zinc, or salicylic acid. These ingredients may work by inhibiting the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, which converts testosterone to DHT, or by decreasing the binding of DHT to hair follicles.
Reducing Scalp DHT
: By using these shampoos regularly, individuals may help reduce the accumulation of DHT on the scalp, which can contribute to follicular miniaturization and hair loss in individuals genetically predisposed to androgenetic alopecia (male or female pattern baldness).
Supporting Scalp Health
: Many DHT-blocking shampoos also include nourishing ingredients like vitamins, antioxidants, and botanical extracts to improve scalp health and hair growth. These ingredients may help to improve the overall condition of the scalp and hair follicles, resulting in a more favourable environment for healthy hair growth.
Complementary Treatment
: DHT-blocking shampoos are frequently used in conjunction with other treatments approved by the FDA to treat androgenetic alopecia, such as minoxidil (Rogaine) or finasteride (Propecia). Using these products together may result in greater benefits than using them separately.
Consistency and Patience
: It is important to note that the effects of DHT-blocking shampoos may take some time to show, and consistency is key. It may take several months of consistent use before individuals notice improvements in hair growth or a reduction in hair loss.
Consultation with a Professional
: While DHT-blocking shampoos can be a useful addition to a hair care routine, particularly for those concerned about hair loss, it is critical to consult with a dermatologist or healthcare professional for personalised advice and to discuss alternative treatment options that may be more appropriate based on individual needs and medical history.
Advanced Strategies for Combating DHT-Induced Hair Loss
Combating DHT-induced hair loss often requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses both the hormonal factors contributing to hair loss and the overall health of the scalp and hair follicles. Here are some advanced strategies that can be effective in managing DHT-induced hair loss:
Prescription Medications
: Finasteride (Propecia) and minoxidil (Rogaine) are both FDA-approved medications for treating androgenetic alopecia (male or female pattern baldness). Finasteride works by inhibiting the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, which lowers DHT levels in the scalp, whereas minoxidil promotes hair growth by increasing blood flow to the scalp and stimulating hair follicles. These medications are frequently used together to improve efficacy.
Topical DHT Blockers
: In addition to prescription medications, there are topical DHT-blocking solutions that contain ketoconazole, saw palmetto extract, or caffeine. These solutions are applied directly to the scalp and may help reduce DHT levels locally, thereby supplementing the effects of oral medications.
Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT)
: LLLT, also known as red light therapy or cold laser therapy, is a non-invasive method of stimulating hair growth by increasing blood flow to the scalp and promoting cellular activity in the hair follicles. LLLT devices can be used at home or in a clinical setting, and they are frequently recommended as part of a comprehensive hair loss treatment regimen.
Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy
: PRP therapy involves injecting a concentrated solution of the patient's own platelets into the scalp to promote hair growth. Platelets contain growth factors that aid in tissue repair and regeneration, and PRP therapy has demonstrated promising results in improving hair density and thickness in people with androgenetic alopecia.
Hair Transplant Surgery
: Hair transplant surgery may be an option for people suffering from advanced hair loss who have not responded to medical treatments. During a hair transplant, hair follicles are harvested from donor areas of the scalp and transplanted to thinning or balding areas, where they grow naturally.
Nutritional Supplements
: Certain nutritional supplements may help support scalp health and reduce hair loss. Supplements containing ingredients like biotin, vitamins (such as Biotin, Vitamin D, and Vitamin E), minerals (such as Zinc and Iron), and amino acids can provide essential nutrients for hair growth and follicle health.
Stress Management
: Chronic stress can exacerbate hormonal imbalances and promote hair loss. Stress-reduction techniques such as meditation, yoga, and deep breathing exercises can help manage stress and promote overall well-being, potentially benefiting scalp health and hair growth.
Consultation with a Specialist
: Consult with a dermatologist or hair loss specialist to determine the best treatment plan for your specific needs and medical history. They can assess the severity of hair loss, identify contributing factors, and recommend tailored treatments for the best results.
Consult with a dermatologist or hair loss specialist to create a treatment plan that is tailored to your specific needs and goals. Additionally, be patient and consistent with your chosen treatments, as it may take several months to see visible results.
