Argan oil has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its numerous benefits for hair growth. This natural oil is extracted from the kernels of the argan tree, which is native to Morocco. It is rich in antioxidants, fatty acids, and vitamin E, making it an excellent natural ingredient for promoting healthy hair growth. In this blog, we will explore the benefits of argan oil for hair growth, how to use it for best results, and any potential disadvantages.
What is argan oil?
Argan oil is a natural oil that is extracted from the kernels of the argan tree. It is a rare oil that is found only in Morocco and has been used for centuries for its numerous health benefits. Argan oil is rich in antioxidants, fatty acids, and
vitamin E
, which makes it an excellent natural ingredient for promoting healthy hair growth.
Origins of argan oil
Argan oil is derived from the argan tree (Argania spinosa), which is native to Morocco. The argan tree thrives in the arid conditions of southwestern Morocco, where it is primarily found near the Sous Valley and the Atlas Mountains' foothills. The indigenous Berber people of Morocco have been producing argan oil for centuries through a labor-intensive process. The argan tree's fruit contains kernels from which oil is extracted. Traditionally, local women would use stones to crack open the argan nuts and remove the kernels from their hard shells. This extraction process was completed by hand. The oil is then extracted from the kernels by grinding and pressing them.
Argan oil has been used in a variety of ways throughout history, including in culinary, medicinal, and cosmetic applications. In Moroccan cuisine, argan oil is prized for its nutty flavor and is used in dishes such as couscous, salads, and tagines. The Berber people used argan oil to treat skin conditions, wounds, and rheumatic problems. In recent years, argan oil has gained popularity worldwide for its numerous cosmetic benefits. It contains essential fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins, making it extremely nourishing and moisturising to the skin and hair. Argan oil is used in a variety of beauty products, including moisturisers, hair conditioners, serums, and facial oils, because of its ability to hydrate, soften, and protect the skin and hair.
Composition of argan oil
Argan oil is valued for its rich and diverse nutrient profile, which includes fatty acids, vitamins, antioxidants, and other bioactive compounds. Here's an overview of the main components found in argan oil.
Fatty Acids
: Argan oil is primarily made up of oleic acid, a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid. Oleic acid helps moisturize and nourish the skin, leaving it soft and supple. Argan oil also contains linoleic acid, an essential omega-6 fatty acid. Linoleic acid supports skin barrier function, promotes hydration, and has anti-inflammatory properties. Stearic acid is a saturated fatty acid found in smaller amounts in argan oil. It helps stabilize the oil and contributes to its creamy texture.
Tocopherols (Vitamin E)
: Argan oil is high in tocopherols, including alpha-tocopherol, a kind of vitamin E. Vitamin E is an effective antioxidant that shields the skin from oxidative stress caused by free radicals, UV radiation, and environmental contaminants. It also promotes skin healing and renewal.
Polyphenols
: Argan oil contains
polyphenolic
compounds like flavonoids and phenolic acids, which are antioxidants and anti-inflammatory. These compounds help to neutralise free radicals, reduce inflammation, and improve skin health.
Phytosterols
: Plant-derived compounds that resemble cholesterol and have skin-protective properties. Argan oil contains a variety of
phytosterols
, including beta-sitosterol, which helps to maintain skin barrier function, increase skin hydration, and reduce inflammation.
Squalene
: Argan oil contains
squalene
, a natural moisturiser. It enhances skin hydration, softness, and smoothness by replenishing the lipid barrier and preventing moisture loss.
Carotenoids
: Carotenoids are pigmented compounds found in plants that have antioxidant properties. Argan oil contains carotenoids like beta-carotene, which protects the skin from oxidative damage and contributes to its vibrant colour.
Sterols
: Argan oil contains sterols like schottenol and spinasterol, which have anti-inflammatory and emollient effects. Sterols soothe and moisturise the skin, making argan oil ideal for dry, sensitive, or irritated skin.
Extraction process of argan oil
Argan oil extraction is a multi-stage process that Moroccan communities have traditionally carried out by hand. The indigenous Berber populations of Morocco have been extracting argan oil for generations, and it is profoundly interwoven in their cultural legacy. Today, while some portions of the process are still done by hand using ancient methods, modern techniques and machinery are being employed to expedite production and meet the expanding global demand for argan oil. Old methods, on the other hand, continue to be prized for their authenticity and preservation of old knowledge and abilities.
Benefits of argan oil for hair growth

environmental factors
such as pollution and
UV rays
.
Nourishing properties of argan oil
Argan oil is well-known for its superior nourishing properties, making it a popular ingredient in skincare, haircare, and cosmetic products. The following are some of the nourishing properties of argan oil:
Moisturising
: Argan oil contains fatty acids such as
oleic acid
and
linoleic acid
, which help moisturise the skin and hair. These fatty acids form a protective barrier on the skin's surface, preventing moisture loss while keeping the skin hydrated and supple.
Antioxidant
: Argan oil contains
tocopherols
(vitamin E) and other antioxidants that help neutralise free radicals and protect the skin from oxidative damage caused by
UV radiation
, pollution, and environmental factors. This antioxidant activity protects against premature ageing and promotes skin health.
Anti-inflammatory
: Argan oil has anti-inflammatory properties that help to soothe and calm irritated or inflamed skin. It can help reduce the redness, itching, and discomfort caused by conditions such as
eczema
,
psoriasis
, or
acne
.
Regenerative
: Argan oil contains vitamin E and squalene, which promote skin regeneration and repair. These compounds help the skin's natural healing process by repairing damaged cells, fading scars, and improving overall texture.
Emollient
: Argan oil has emollient properties, which soften and smooth the skin and hair. It penetrates deep into the skin's layers, providing long-lasting hydration while improving elasticity and suppleness.
Non-comedogenic
: Argan oil is light and non-greasy, making it suitable for all skin types, including oily and acne-prone skin. It is
non-comedogenic
, which means it will not clog pores or cause breakouts, making it an ideal choice for facial skincare.
Protective
: Argan oil forms a protective barrier on the skin's surface, shielding it from external aggressors like UV rays, pollution, and extreme weather. This protective barrier maintains the skin's moisture balance and prevents transepidermal water loss.
Hair Conditioning
: In addition to its skincare benefits, argan oil is prized for its hair conditioning properties. It nourishes and hydrates hair, reduces frizz and split ends, and enhances the manageability and shines.
Strengthening effects on hair follicles
Argan oil is well known for its ability to strengthen hair follicles, resulting in healthier, stronger hair growth. Here's how argan oil strengthens hair follicles.
Nutrient-Rich Composition
: Argan oil contains vital fatty acids, vitamins, and antioxidants that nourish the hair follicles and improve overall hair health. These nutrients permeate the hair follicles, giving the necessary building blocks for robust and resilient hair growth.
Moisture Retention
: One of the key benefits of argan oil is its ability to moisturize and hydrate the hair and scalp. By maintaining optimal moisture levels, argan oil helps prevent dryness and brittleness, which can lead to weak and fragile hair follicles.
Improves Scalp Health
: A healthy scalp is essential for strong hair follicles and healthy hair growth. Argan oil has anti-inflammatory properties that help soothe and calm the scalp, reducing irritation and promoting a healthy environment for hair follicles to thrive.
Enhances Circulation
: Massaging argan oil into the scalp can help improve blood circulation, which is vital for delivering oxygen and nutrients to the hair follicles. Improved circulation nourishes the follicles and stimulates hair growth, resulting in stronger and healthier hair.
Protects Against Damage
: Argan oil forms a protective barrier around the hair shaft, shielding it from environmental damage, such as UV radiation, pollution, and heat styling. By protecting the hair from damage, argan oil helps prevent breakage and
split ends
, leading to stronger and more resilient hair follicles.
Reduces Breakage
: Regular use of argan oil can help reduce hair breakage by strengthening the hair shaft and improving elasticity. Stronger hair is less prone to breakage and split ends, resulting in longer and healthier hair growth over time.
Promotes Hair Growth
: The nourishing and conditioning properties of argan oil can help promote
hair growth
by providing an optimal environment for healthy hair follicles to thrive. Regular use of argan oil can result in thicker, fuller hair with improved strength and resilience.
Enhancement of hair texture and shine
Argan oil is highly regarded for its ability to improve hair texture and add a beautiful shine. Here's how argan oil enhances hair texture and shine:
Argan oil contains fatty acids, specifically oleic and linoleic acid, which penetrate the hair shaft and provide intense hydration. This moisturization softens and smoothes the hair cuticle, improving texture and reducing roughness.
The moisturising properties of argan oil help to control frizz and flyaways by sealing the hair cuticle and preventing moisture loss. This results in hair strands that are smoother, easier to manage, and less prone to frizz and static.
Argan oil can help seal split ends and prevent additional damage to the hair shaft. By coating the hair with a protective layer, argan oil helps to minimize breakage and keep the hair looking smooth and healthy.
Argan oil is renowned for its capacity to give hair a glossy sheen. When applied to the hair shaft, argan oil reflects light, giving the appearance of smoother, shinier hair. This adds dimension and lustre to the hair, improving its overall appearance.
Regular use of argan oil can improve hair elasticity, making it more flexible and less prone to breakage. This causes hair to feel stronger and more resilient, with improved texture and shine.
Argan oil creates a protective layer around the hair shaft, shielding it from heat styling tools and environmental stressors that can cause damage and dullness. By protecting the hair from heat damage, argan oil helps to maintain its natural shine and vitality.
Unlike heavy oils, which can weigh down the hair, argan oil is lightweight and non-greasy, making it suitable for all hair types. It quickly absorbs into the hair and leaves no greasy residue, providing instant nourishment and conditioning for silky-smooth strands.
By nourishing the scalp and improving blood circulation, argan oil promotes healthier hair growth from the roots. The general texture and shine of hair are influenced by stronger, healthier hair growth.
Does argan oil stop hair loss?
Argan oil has been shown to help prevent hair loss by nourishing and strengthening the hair follicles. However, it is important to note that hair loss can have numerous causes, and argan oil may not be effective in all cases. It is important to
speak to a dermatologist
or healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause of hair loss and develop an appropriate treatment plan.
Exploring argan oil's impact on hair fall
Argan oil can help reduce hair fall or hair loss by addressing the underlying causes. Here's how argan oil impacts hair loss:
Scalp Health
: Argan oil's moisturizing and anti-inflammatory qualities help improve scalp health. A healthy scalp promotes hair development, whereas problems such as dryness, dandruff, or inflammation can lead to hair loss. By moisturizing and soothing the scalp, argan oil helps maintain optimal conditions for healthy hair growth and reduces the likelihood of hair falling due to scalp issues.
Strengthening Hair Follicles
: Argan oil contains nutrients such as vitamin E, vital fatty acids, and antioxidants, which feed and strengthen the hair shaft. Stronger hair is less likely to break and shed, minimising overall hair loss. Regular application of argan oil can improve the strength and resilience of the hair, resulting in less hair fall over time.
Preventing Breakage
: Argan oil moisturises and conditions the hair, reducing dryness and brittleness, which can contribute to breaking. By providing essential nutrients and hydration to the hair shaft, argan oil improves elasticity and flexibility, minimizing the risk of breakage and hair fall.
Protecting Against Damage
: Argan oil creates a protective layer around the hair shaft, safeguarding it from environmental harm, heat styling, and chemical treatments that can weaken the hair and cause hair loss. By shielding hair from harm, argan oil minimises hair loss brought on by outside influences while maintaining the strength and vitality of the hair.
Encouraging Healthy Hair Growth
: By nourishing the scalp, enhancing blood circulation, and supplying vital nutrients to the hair follicles, argan oil promotes healthy hair growth. Healthy hair growth slows the rate of hair loss by ensuring that new hair replaces lost ones effectively.
Reducing Stress
: Massaging argan oil into the scalp can help relieve stress and tension, both of which are known causes of hair loss. The massage's relaxing properties, combined with the nourishing effects of argan oil, can help promote a healthy scalp environment and reduce stress-induced hair loss.
Research insights on argan oil and hair loss
While argan oil is extensively used and respected for its nourishing and moisturising benefits in hair care, there is no scientific evidence on its effectiveness in treating hair loss. However, some studies and research insights provide valuable information on the potential benefits of argan oil for hair health and its impact on factors associated with hair loss, such as moisturising and nourishing properties, scalp health, antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory effects, and improved hair texture and shine.
Testimonials from users regarding hair loss prevention with argan oil
While scientific research on argan oil for hair loss prevention is limited, there are numerous testimonials and anecdotal reports from users who have seen positive results in terms of hair health and hair loss reduction. Some user testimonials about their experiences with argan oil include increased hair thickness, reduced hair shedding, improved scalp health, softer, shinier hair, faster hair growth, and overall hair health. It is important to note that people's experiences with argan oil vary, and what works for one person may not work for another. Furthermore, while testimonials provide useful information about users' experiences, they are not a substitute for scientific evidence.

Additional Tips and Considerations
In addition to applying argan oil consistently, here are some other tips and considerations to maximise its benefits for your hair and skin:
Start with a Patch Test
: Before applying argan oil to your hair or skin, perform a patch test to rule out any allergic reactions or sensitivities. Apply a small amount of oil to a small area of the skin and wait 24 hours to see if any adverse reactions develop.
Use sparingly
: Argan oil is extremely concentrated, so a little goes a long way. Start with a small amount and adjust as needed to avoid greasiness or buildup. You can always add more oil as needed, but it is best to start with a low amount.
Customise Your Routine
: Tailor your argan oil application to meet your specific hair and skin needs. Experiment with various application methods, such as overnight treatments, scalp massages, or combining with other products, to see which works best for you.
Consider Hair Type
: Different hair types may react differently to argan oil. Fine or oily hair may benefit from using argan oil as a pre-shampoo treatment or in small amounts as a leave-in conditioner, whereas dry or coarse hair may benefit from more frequent or heavier treatments.
Mindful Scalp Application
: When applying argan oil to the scalp, massage it into the roots and any areas of concern, such as dry patches or irritation. Avoid using too much oil to prevent buildup and weigh down the hair.
Consistent Use for Results
: Some argan oil benefits, such as increased shine or softness, may be noticeable right away, while others, such as improved hair growth or skin texture, may take some time to manifest. To get the best results from your argan oil routine, be patient and consistent.

Disadvantages of argan oil for hair
While argan oil is generally considered safe for most people when applied topically, it may cause side effects in some people, particularly those with sensitive skin or allergies. Here are some potential side effects of using argan oil.
Skin Irritation
: Some people may experience skin irritation or allergic reactions after using argan oil, particularly if they have sensitive skin or are allergic to nuts. Skin irritation symptoms can include redness, itching, burning, or a rash. Before using argan oil, perform a patch test to rule out any adverse reactions.
Acne Breakouts
: Although argan oil is non-comedogenic and can help regulate oil production in the skin, it may cause acne breakouts in some people, especially if used in excess or if the skin is predisposed to acne. If you have acne-prone skin, use argan oil sparingly and monitor how your skin reacts.
Allergic Reactions
: Individuals with nut allergies may be allergic to argan oil, as it is derived from the kernels of the argan tree. Argan oil allergies can range from mild to severe, with symptoms including hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, and anaphylaxis. If you have a known nut allergy, it's essential to avoid using argan oil or consult with an allergist before using it.
Greasy Hair
: Using too much argan oil or applying it too close to the scalp can result in greasy or oily hair, particularly in people with fine or oily hair. Argan oil should be used sparingly and applied to the hair's lengths and ends rather than the roots.
Eye Irritation
: Avoid putting argan oil in your eyes because it can cause irritation and discomfort. If accidental contact occurs, thoroughly rinse your eyes with water and seek medical attention if the irritation persists.
Digestive Issues (Oral Consumption)
: Although argan oil is typically applied topically, some people may consume it orally for its potential health benefits. However, consuming large amounts of argan oil may result in digestive problems such as nausea, diarrhoea, or abdominal discomfort. Before consuming argan oil orally, exercise caution and seek the advice of a healthcare professional.
Sun Sensitivity
: When using argan oil topically, some people may become more sensitive to sunlight, particularly if it is applied to exposed skin areas. This may cause sunburn or skin damage. If you plan to use argan oil during the day and will be spending time outside, you should wear protective clothing and sunscreen.
If you use argan oil and encounter any negative reactions or side effects, stop using it right away and seek additional advice from a dermatologist or other healthcare provider. It's essential to listen to your body and adjust your skincare routine accordingly to ensure the safety and effectiveness of argan oil usage for your individual needs.
Precautions for using argan oil on different hair types
When using argan oil on various hair types, it is critical to take certain precautions to ensure that you get the best results without any negative side effects. Here are some precautions when using argan oil on various hair types:
Fine or thin hair
: Use argan oil sparingly to avoid weighing it down and making it appear greasy or limp. Focus on applying argan oil to the mid-lengths and ends of the hair, avoiding the scalp area. Consider using lighter argan oil formulations, such as sprays or mists, as they are less likely to overload fine hair.
Oily Hair
: Use argan oil with caution on oily hair because it can aggravate oiliness if applied too close to the scalp or in large quantities. Focus on applying argan oil to the lengths and ends of the hair, avoiding the roots and scalp. To reduce greasiness, try using argan oil as a pre-shampoo treatment or a leave-in conditioner on damp hair.
Dry or Damaged Hair
: Argan oil is especially good for dry or damaged hair, but do not overdo it. Begin with a small amount of argan oil and gradually increase as needed, concentrating on the areas of the hair that are most vulnerable to dryness or damage. Consider applying argan oil as an overnight treatment or as a deep conditioning mask to provide intense hydration and repair.
Curly or Coily Hair
: Argan oil is a great choice for curly or coily hair because it moisturises and defines curls while reducing frizz. Apply argan oil to damp hair, concentrating on the lengths and ends, to seal in moisture and improve curl definition. Consider using argan oil-based styling products, such as curl creams or serums, to keep your hair moisturised and in shape all day.
Color-Treated Hair
: Argan oil is generally safe to use on color-treated hair, but it's essential to check the compatibility of the product with your specific hair dye or treatment. Wait at least 48 hours after coloring your hair before using argan oil to ensure that the color has fully set. Use argan oil to help maintain the vibrancy and condition of color-treated hair, focusing on areas that are prone to dryness or damage.
Sensitive Scalp
: If you have a sensitive scalp, conduct a patch test before using argan oil to rule out any adverse reactions or irritation. Avoid applying argan oil directly to the scalp if you experience sensitivity or discomfort. Instead, apply it to the hair's lengths and ends.
By taking these precautions and tailoring your argan oil use to your specific hair type and needs, you can reap the many benefits of this versatile oil while avoiding any negative effects. If you are not sure how to incorporate argan oil into your hair care routine, speak with a hairstylist or dermatologist for personalised advice.
Consulting with a dermatologist for personalized advice on using argan oil
If you have specific concerns or questions about using argan oil, you should consult a dermatologist, especially if you have sensitive skin, scalp issues, or a history of allergies. Here's how a dermatologist can give you personalised advice on using argan oil:
Skin and Hair Type Evaluation
: A dermatologist can assess your skin and hair type to determine whether argan oil is appropriate for you. They can make recommendations based on your skin's sensitivity, moisture levels, and any existing scalp conditions.
Addressing Skin and Scalp Concerns
: If you have acne, eczema, psoriasis, or dandruff, a dermatologist can make personalised recommendations for incorporating argan oil into your skincare and hair care regimen. They can advise you on the best formulations and application techniques for addressing your concerns effectively.
Allergy Testing
: If you have a history of allergies or sensitivities to certain ingredients, a dermatologist can run allergy tests to see if you are allergic to argan oil or any other ingredients commonly found in skincare and hair care products. This can help to avoid adverse reactions and ensure the safety of your skincare routine.
Monitoring for Adverse Reactions
: If you experience any adverse reactions or side effects while using argan oil, such as skin irritation, acne breakouts, or scalp discomfort, a dermatologist can help identify the cause and advise you on how to manage or avoid these reactions in the future. They may recommend alternative products or treatments based on your specific requirements.
