Morus alba, also known as white mulberry, has attracted attention for its potential to promote hair development. Morus alba root extract contains a variety of bioactive chemicals that help with hair growth, notably by lengthening the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle.
Understanding the Anagen Phase and Hair Growth
The anagen phase is one of the most important stages in the
hair growth
cycle, determining hair length and health. To understand Morus alba root extract's effect on hair growth, you must first understand the anagen phase and the entire hair growth cycle.
Hair grows in three major phases:
Anagen Phase (Growth Phase)
: This phase can last anywhere from 2 to 7 years, depending on genetics, health, and hormonal effects. During the anagen phase, hair follicles actively produce new hair cells. The cells in the root of the hair (the dermal papilla) divide rapidly, resulting in the growth of the hair shaft. The length of the anagen phase determines how long the hair can grow. Approximately 85% of hair on the scalp is in the anagen phase at any given moment.
Catagen Phase (Transition Phase)
: This phase lasts around two to three weeks. Hair development stops and the hair follicle shrinks and separates from the dermal papilla. This is a brief time in which the hair changes from active growth to resting.
Telogen Phase (Resting Phase)
: This phase lasts around three months. Hair does not develop during this time but instead remains in the follicle. Eventually, the old hair falls out, and new hair begins to grow, ushering in a new anagen stage. Normally, 10-15% of hair is in the telogen phase at all times.
What is the Anagen Phase?
The anagen phase, commonly known as the growth phase, is one of three major stages in the hair development cycle. It is the stage at which hair follicles actively produce new hair. Understanding the anagen phase is critical for understanding how hair grows and how specific treatments or products, such as Morus alba root extract, might affect hair growth.
Key Features of the Anagen Phase
The anagen phase is the time when hair follicles actively produce hair. This process involves the rapid division of cells in the hair root (dermal papilla), which pulls the hair shaft up and out of the follicle.
The length of the anagen period varies greatly across individuals. It normally lasts between two and seven years. The duration of this phase can be influenced by genetics, health, age, and hormone levels. The length of the anagen phase determines how long hair can grow. This is why some people can grow their hair to extremely long lengths, whereas others may discover that it stops growing at a shorter length.
At any given time, around 85-90% of the hairs on a healthy human scalp are in the anagen phase. This high percentage guarantees continual hair growth and renewal.
The anagen phase has a substantial impact on both hair quality and length. Hair that stays in the anagen phase for an extended period is usually longer and healthier. Shorter anagen stages lead to shorter hair lengths.
The Role of Dermal Papilla Cells in Hair Growth
Dermal papilla cells (DPCs) are responsible for hair development and cycle management. These specialised cells are found at the base of the hair follicle, within the dermal papilla, which is a structure at the follicle's bulb. Understanding the function and significance of dermal papilla cells is critical for understanding how hair grows and how different therapies affect hair growth.
Key Functions of Dermal Papilla Cells
Regulation of Hair Follicle Development
: Dermal papilla cells play an important role in the establishment and growth of hair follicles. During embryogenesis, they interact with epidermal cells to stimulate the formation of hair follicles. These interactions involve signalling pathways that control the differentiation and proliferation of the cells required to generate hair follicles.
Control of the Hair Growth Cycle
: DPCs regulate the hair development cycle, which consists of three phases: anagen (growing), catagen (transition), and telogen (resting). They generate and secrete a variety of signalling chemicals, including growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix components, which impact the behaviour of other cells inside the hair follicle.
Induction of the Anagen Phase
: Dermal papilla cells serve an important role in generating and maintaining the anagen phase. They release growth factors such as IGF-1, FGF, and VEGF, which stimulate the development of keratinocytes in the hair matrix. The anagen phase is distinguished by aggressive hair growth, which is caused by the rapid division and differentiation of these keratinocytes.
Regulation of Hair Shaft Production
: DPCs play a role in regulating hair shaft formation during the anagen phase, which includes the synthesis of keratin proteins and other structural components. The size and shape of the dermal papilla are thought to influence the thickness and texture of hair.
Interaction with Stem Cells
: Dermal papilla cells interact with stem cells found in the bulge region of the hair follicles. These interactions are essential for starting hair regeneration and cycling. They stimulate stem cells to multiply and develop into the numerous cell types required for new hair growth.
Factors Influencing the Anagen Phase
Anagen is the active growth stage of hair follicles, during which the hair shaft develops. This time might last many years and is influenced by a variety of factors. Understanding these factors is important for managing hair growth and addressing issues like hair loss. Here are the primary elements influencing the anagen phase:
Genetics
: Genetics influences the length of the anagen period. People inherit the length of their hair growth cycles from their parents. Those with a longer anagen phase have naturally longer hair, whilst those with a shorter anagen phase have shorter hair.
Hormones
: Hormones, particularly androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), have a considerable impact on hair growth. High androgen levels can abbreviate the anagen phase, resulting in disorders such as androgenetic alopecia (pattern
baldness
). In contrast, hormones such as oestrogen can prolong the anagen phase, resulting in longer and denser hair.
Age
: As people get older, the duration of the anagen phase reduces. This leads to shorter hair growth cycles and weaker hair. This shortening is caused by age-related hormonal changes and diminished cellular activity in hair follicles.
Nutritional Status
:
Adequate nutrition is required to maintain a healthy anagen phase. Key nutrients are: Proteins are essential for the synthesis of keratin, the primary component of human hair. Vitamins include A, B-complex vitamins (especially biotin),D, E and
vitamin C
. Minerals include iron, zinc, and selenium. Poor nutrition can result in telogen effluvium, a condition in which hair enters the resting phase prematurely.
Scalp Health
:
The anagen phase can be altered by the scalp's condition.
Dandruff
,
psoriasis
, and fungal infections can all disrupt natural hair growth by changing the environment on the scalp. A healthy scalp with good blood circulation promotes a longer anagen phase.
Stress
:
Chronic stress can cause hair loss, including telogen effluvium, which happens when stress hormones prematurely transfer hair follicles from the anagen to the resting phase. Stress management techniques such as meditation, exercise, and adequate sleep can all contribute to a healthy anagen phase.
Medications
:
Certain drugs can disrupt the anagen phase. For example, chemotherapy medications frequently induce hair follicles to enter the resting phase, resulting in hair loss. Hormonal therapies, such as birth control pills, can either shorten or lengthen the anagen phase, depending on their hormonal effects. Beta-blockers and antidepressants can both influence hair growth cycles.
Environmental Factors
: Environmental contaminants,
UV
radiation, and extreme weather conditions can damage hair follicles and disrupt the anagen phase. Protecting hair from external stimuli can aid in its healthy growth cycle.
Hair Care Practices
:
Frequent use of heat styling equipment, chemical treatments, and tight hairstyles can harm hair follicles and decrease the anagen period. Gentle hair care procedures that reduce physical and chemical harm promote longer hair growth cycles.
Medical Conditions
: Thyroid disorders, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), and autoimmune diseases can all influence hormone levels and immunological responses, interfering with normal hair development. Treating these issues can assist in restoring a healthy anagen phase.
Morus alba Root Extract: Nature's Hair Growth Elixir
Morus alba, or white mulberry, has been used in traditional medicine for millennia. It has recently received attention for its potential to promote hair growth. Morus alba root extract is well-known for its characteristics that may have a good impact on hair development. The following are the major characteristics that make Morus alba root extract a promising natural elixir for hair growth:
Rich in Bioactive Compounds
:
Morus alba root extract contains a variety of bioactive components, including flavonoids, alkaloids, and polyphenols. These substances contain antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial effects, all of which help to keep the scalp and hair follicles healthy.
Antioxidant Properties
: Morus alba root extract's strong antioxidant content aids in the fight against oxidative stress, a major cause of hair loss and ageing. These
antioxidants
protect hair follicles from injury and promote their proper function by neutralising free radicals.
Anti-inflammatory Effects
: Scalp inflammation can alter the hair growth cycle, leading to disorders such as alopecia. Morus alba root extract has anti-inflammatory qualities that calm the scalp, alleviate irritation, and promote hair development.
DHT Inhibition
: Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), an androgen, causes androgenetic alopecia by shortening the anagen phase and decreasing hair follicles. Some research indicate that Morus alba root extract may reduce the activity of 5-alpha reductase, an enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT. This inhibition can aid to extend the anagen phase and reduce hair loss.
Improved Blood Circulation
: Proper blood circulation in the scalp is essential for transporting nutrients and oxygen to hair follicles. Morus alba root extract can increase blood flow to the scalp, ensuring that hair follicles receive the nutrients they require for healthy growth.
Nourishment and Hydration
: The extract contains important elements that nourish both the scalp and hair. It can also aid in maintaining moisture, keep the scalp hydrated, and prevent dryness and flakiness, which can impede hair growth.
Hair Follicle Stimulation
: Morus alba root extract is thought to stimulate hair follicles, causing them to transition from the resting phase (telogen) to the growth phase (anagen). This stimulation can lead to increased hair density and thickness over time.
The Science Behind Morus alba Root Extract
The science behind Morus alba root extract demonstrates its promise as a natural cure for hair growth. Its high bioactive chemical content provides antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and DHT-inhibiting properties that promote healthy hair follicles and prolong the anagen phase. While more study, particularly large-scale clinical studies, is required to completely understand its efficacy, current evidence indicates that Morus alba root extract is a viable ingredient in hair care products. As usual, people should contact with healthcare specialists before beginning any new treatment to confirm that it is appropriate for their personal situation.
How Morus alba Induces the Anagen Phase
Morus alba root extract initiates the anagen phase through a variety of mechanisms, including DHT inhibition, dermal papilla cell activation, inflammation reduction, antioxidant protection, improved blood circulation, and nutrient availability. These combined effects provide a favourable environment for hair follicles, stimulating development and extending the anagen period. While further research is needed to completely understand all mechanisms and validate efficacy in bigger clinical studies, the available information suggests that Morus alba root extract has the potential to be a natural and effective treatment for promoting hair growth.
Comparing Morus alba with Other Hair Growth Treatments
When considering hair growth treatments, it is vital to assess their methodology, efficacy, side effects, and overall benefits. Morus alba root extract is a natural remedy that has garnered recognition for its ability to stimulate hair growth. Here, we compare Morus alba to other common hair growth treatments.
Minoxidil
:
Minoxidil
is a vasodilator that boosts blood flow to hair follicles, extending the anagen phase and promoting hair growth. It is widely used and clinically confirmed to be beneficial in treating androgenetic alopecia in men and women alike. Results usually appear after 3-6 months of constant use. Typical adverse effects include scalp irritation, itching, and
dry scalp
. In rare situations, it might result in undesirable facial hair growth and hair texture alterations.
Comparison with Morus alba
: Morus alba also improves scalp blood circulation, but with natural substances rather than the chemical irritation often associated with minoxidil. Morus alba's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties offer additional scalp health benefits not found in minoxidil.
Finasteride
:
Finasteride reduces the conversion of testosterone to DHT, hence preventing hair follicle miniaturisation. Effective in men for reducing hair loss and promoting hair growth. Clinical improvements are frequently observed after 3–6 months. Potential side effects include sexual dysfunction, depression, and an increased chance of advanced prostate cancer. Women should avoid using this product, especially when pregnant.
Comparison with Morus alba
: Morus alba also inhibits DHT, however it comes from natural sources and has a lower chance of serious adverse effects. It is suitable for both men and women and does not have the hormonal adverse effects that finasteride has.
Biotin Supplements
:
Biotin (vitamin B7) promotes keratin formation, which is necessary for hair strength and development. Beneficial for people with biotin deficiency, however evidence for its usefulness for hair development in the general population is lacking. Generally regarded as safe with few adverse effects. Excess biotin intake can affect laboratory test findings.
Comparison with Morus alba
: Morus alba has a greater spectrum of nutrients and bioactive substances, providing more comprehensive support for hair health than biotin alone.
Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy
:
PRP is a procedure that involves injecting concentrated platelets from the patient's own blood into the scalp to stimulate hair follicles and promote growth. Clinical investigations indicate promise, with gains in hair density and thickness noted after numerous sessions. There are few side effects because it uses the patient's own blood, although injections can be uncomfortable and increase the risk of infection.
Comparison with Morus alba
: Morus alba is a non-invasive option that can be administered topically or orally, eliminating the need for injections. Provides additional anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
Hair Transplant Surgery
:
A surgical procedure in which hair follicles are transplanted from a donor location (often the back of the head) to thinning or balding areas. Extremely effective for permanent hair restoration. The surgeon's competence determines whether the results are striking or natural-looking. Infection,
scarring
, and unusual hair growth patterns are all potential risks. Requires a long healing period and can be costly.
Comparison with Morus alba
: Morus alba is a non-surgical, less expensive alternative that has no danger of surgical consequences. Ideal for those looking for a natural solution without invasive procedures.
