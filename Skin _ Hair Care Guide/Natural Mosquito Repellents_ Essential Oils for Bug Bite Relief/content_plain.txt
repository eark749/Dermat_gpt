Essential oils can be used as natural insect repellents and to treat bug bites. This blog discusses some commonly used essential oils for this purpose.
Understanding Essential Oils as Mosquito Repellents
Essential oils have natural properties that make them effective mosquito repellents.  Here's an explanation of how they function:
Some essential oils contain compounds that are known to repel mosquitos.  These compounds may interfere with the insect's ability to locate their target using its sense of smell. For example, citronellal in citronella oil and eucalyptus oil can deter mosquitoes by masking their scent or making them unpleasant.
Essential oils are volatile, which means they readily evaporate at room temperature. When applied to the skin or dispersed in the air, the volatile compounds in essential oils form a barrier that mosquitoes may find difficult to penetrate, reducing the likelihood of bites.
Mosquitoes are drawn to humans due to the carbon dioxide we exhale, body heat, and body odour. Some essential oils, such as lavender and peppermint, have strong, pleasant scents that can help mask mosquito attractants, making it more difficult for them to find and bite us.
Essential oils can be used in a variety of ways to repel mosquitos. They can be applied topically to the skin (diluted with a carrier oil to prevent irritation), diffused to disperse the scent in indoor spaces, or even mixed into candles or lotions.
While essential oils can provide some protection against mosquitoes, their efficacy varies depending on concentration, frequency of application, and individual sensitivity. They may need to be reapplied more often than synthetic repellents.
It is worth noting that, while essential oils can be a natural and pleasant alternative to chemical mosquito repellents, their effectiveness may be inconsistent or short-lived. Before using any essential oil on a larger area of skin, always test a small amount on a small patch of skin to see if there are any adverse reactions.
The Science Behind Essential Oils in Repelling Mosquitoes
The science behind essential oils' ability to repel mosquitos includes several factors:
Chemical Composition
: Essential oils are made up of a variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) extracted from plants.  Some of these compounds have been shown to have mosquito-repellent properties. Examples of compounds that are known to keep mosquitoes away are citronellal, which is found in citronella oil, and eucalyptol, which is found in eucalyptus oil.
Olfactory Response
: To find hosts for food, mosquitoes rely on their sense of smell.  The presence of humans or animals can be difficult for mosquitoes to detect due to certain compounds in essential oils interfering with their olfactory receptors. It may discourage them from landing and biting due to this disturbance in their sensory perception.
Behavioural Response
: In reaction to chemical cues in their surroundings, mosquitoes display particular behaviours.  Essential oils have the potential to repel these behaviours. For example, the strong scent of essential oils such as lavender or peppermint may deter mosquitos from approaching areas where these scents are present.
Environmental Factors
: Temperature, humidity, and air movement can all have an impact on essential oils' effectiveness as mosquito repellents.  These factors can influence the volatility and dispersal of essential oil compounds, affecting their ability to repel mosquitos.
Individual Variability
: Different mosquito species may react differently to essential oils, as may individual mosquitos within a species. Furthermore, the repellent effect can be modified by factors such as essential oil content, exposure length, and mosquito sensitivity.
While scientific studies have shown that certain essential oils repel mosquitos, it is important to note that their efficacy varies depending on a variety of factors. More research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of action and optimise their effectiveness as mosquito repellents.
Essential Oils vs. Chemical Insect Repellents: A Comparison
Essential oils and chemical insect repellents have different properties and benefits. Here is a comparison.
Essential Oils
:
Essential oils are derived from plants and thus offer a natural alternative to synthetic chemical repellents.  Many people prefer essential oils because of their perceived safety and environmental friendliness.
Essential oils degrade naturally in the environment, reducing their impact on ecosystems as opposed to synthetic chemicals, which can remain in the environment for longer periods of time.
Essential oils frequently have pleasant scents, making them more appealing to use, particularly for people who are sensitive to the strong odour of chemical repellents.
Essential oils typically offer shorter-duration protection than chemical repellents. They may need to be reapplied more frequently to remain effective.
The effectiveness of essential oils as repellents varies depending on concentration, formulation, individual sensitivity, and environmental conditions. Some essential oils may be more effective against certain types of mosquitos than others.
Chemical Insect Repellents
:
Chemical insect repellents, such as DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) or picaridin, can provide longer-lasting protection with a single application than essential oils.
Synthetic chemical repellents have been extensively researched and proven effective against a wide variety of insects, including mosquitos, ticks, and flies.  Health authorities frequently recommend them in areas where the disease is prevalent.
Chemical insect repellents are widely available in a variety of forms, including sprays, lotions, and wearable devices. They are also commonly found in commercial insect-repellent products.
Some people may develop skin irritation or allergic reactions to chemical insect repellents, particularly if they are used for an extended period of time. Certain chemical repellents should not be used on children under a certain age or while pregnant.
Some chemical insect repellents, such as DEET, have raised environmental concerns because they remain in waterways and may be toxic to aquatic organisms.  Proper disposal and use according to label instructions can help to reduce these risks.
How Different Essential Oils Deter Mosquitoes
Different essential oils deter mosquitos through a variety of mechanisms, the most common of which is their chemical composition and scent. Here's how some commonly used essential oils repel mosquitos:
Citronella Oil
: Citronella oil is a popular natural mosquito repellent. It contains citronellal and geraniol, which inhibit the mosquito's ability to detect human hosts by masking the scent of carbon dioxide and other attractants emitted by humans.
Lavender Oil
: The beautiful flowery scent of lavender oil repels mosquitoes. It has substances with insect-repelling qualities, such as linalyl acetate and linalool.  Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory qualities of lavender oil can help reduce mosquito bite pain.
Peppermint Oil
: Mosquitoes are repelled by the potent, revitalising aroma of peppermint oil. It contains menthol and menthone, which mosquitoes dislike. The cooling sensation of peppermint oil also helps to relieve itching from bug bites.
Eucalyptus Oil
: Eucalyptus oil has the ability to repel mosquitoes due to the presence of cineole, also known as eucalyptol. The strong, fresh scent of eucalyptus oil masks the scent of humans, making it difficult for mosquitos to find their victims.
Tea Tree Oil
: Tea tree oil has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties that can help relieve insect bites.  Its strong scent repels mosquitoes, discouraging them from landing and biting.
Cinnamon Oil
: Cinnamon oil contains cinnamaldehyde, an insecticide.  The scent of cinnamon oil is strong and can deter mosquitos from approaching areas where it is applied.
Lemon Eucalyptus Oil
: Citronellal and citronellol, two compounds with mosquito-repelling qualities, are present in lemon eucalyptus oil. In certain studies, it has proven to be just as successful at keeping mosquitoes away as DEET.
Soothing Bug Bites with Essential Oils
Essential oils have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and cooling properties that can help with bug bites. Essential oils that can help soothe bug bites include lavender oil, tea tree oil, peppermint oil, chamomile oil, eucalyptus oil, and calendula oil. To avoid skin irritation, dilute essential oils with a carrier oil such as coconut oil or sweet almond oil before applying them to bug bites. The general rule is to use 1-2 drops of essential oil per teaspoon of carrier oil. You can apply the diluted essential oil blend to the affected area and gently massage it in. Reapply as needed for ongoing relief.  If you have any adverse reactions, stop using it and seek medical attention.
The Healing Properties of Essential Oils for Bug Bite Relief
