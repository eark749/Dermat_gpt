<h2><b>Korean Approach to Flawless Skin: Key Products and Practices<br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="Korean Approach to Flawless Skin: Key Products and Practices" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_4_42_480x480.jpg?v=1704956932"/></div>
<p><span>Koreans believe in using the products that are made in their homeland for their skincare regimen. They hardly apply any other product on to their skin. The main reason behind it is that they believe in the amalgamation of innovation, science and traditional beauty practices. The </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/korean-skincare"><span>Korean Skincare</span></a><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/korean-skincare"> products </a>before coming to the shelves get researched upon both qualitatively and quantitatively. Only after complete due diligence, the products are made available for the public. </span></p>
<p><span>The benchmark of Korean Skincare is ‘glass skin’. It implies a luminous and glowing skin that appears crystal-clear and translucent with absence of pores, that appears like a clean piece of glass. For this reason, they have certain fundamentals while doing skincare. They are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Start caring for your skin early</b><span>- As opposed to western philosophy, Korean Skincare focuses on pampering and caring for the skin as early as mid- teens. Koreans don’t believe in waiting for the first signs of ageing to appear to start caring for their skin. As a result, they are successful in delaying and combating the process of ageing.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Treat, don’t hide</b><span>- Koreans believe that instead of focusing on using makeup to hide the skin flaws, use the skincare products that treat and correct them. They view makeup as a fun component and not as a necessity.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use natural products</b><span>- Koreans are a strict believer of using the products obtained from nature, instead of harsh chemicals. Various plant extracts, animal secretions and essential oils are the building blocks of the <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/ultra-v">Korean skincare line.</a></span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Pat, not smear</b><span>- To achieve maximal absorption of skincare products, Koreans believe in patting the skincare products into the skin, instead of smearing it. Smearing the skincare products leads to more of wiping away the product, instead of absorption.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Make-up free at night</b><span>- Koreans are very disciplined when it comes to their skincare routine. Removing makeup is a skincare essential before getting the beauty sleep. Clean face makes way for a clear face.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Work out those facial muscles</b><span>- A face that is well contoured is the face that appears young. To achieve natural V-shaped chin and popping cheekbones, exercising them is mandatory. These exercises are explained in detail, further deep in the blog.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consistency is the key</b><span>- Koreans are firm believers of being consistent while indulging in skincare. No matter how good the product is, it will not work if one is not constant, diligent and consistent in his routine.To avail maximum benefits of skincare products, a person needs to be regular while using them.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Exploring Favourite Korean Beauty Products</b></h3>
<p><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/cosrx">Korean skincare products</a> are a rage right now. They are indeed selling like hot pancakes. The reason behind that is they are natural products, devoid of any harsh chemicals and aid in achieving desired results. The most loved ingredients of korean skincare are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4><strong> Centella Asiatica<br/> </strong></h4>

</li>
<li>
<h4><strong> Propolis<br/> </strong></h4>
<p><span>Though not a vegan product, yet it is natural. It is a product obtained from the beehive that is basically used to strengthen it. It offers anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, antiviral, anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory benefits to the skin. It proves great for healing skin wounds as it not only soothes the skin but also enhances the production of collagen. It aids in keeping the skin smooth, supple and devoid of redness. </span><span>Shangpree Rich Moist Modeling Mask </span><span>combines the benefits of Propolis with other ingredients.</span></p>

It is a storehouse of antioxidants and has a vast amount of </span><span>phytochemicals such as carotenoids,  anthocyanins, and flavonoids.

As a result, anti-ageing benefits are provided to the skin.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<h4><strong> Ginseng<br/> </strong></h4>

</li>
<li>
<h4><strong> Sea Buckthorn<br/> </strong></h4>

<h3><b>Hydration and Nourishment: BTS's Skincare Essentials</b></h3>
<p><span>The above list duly informs us that the mainstay of all these ingredients is to ensure hydration and to provide essential nutrients to the skin. A well hydrated and nourished skin not only looks great, but also is healthy from within. The result is a radiant, glowy, glass skin!!</span></p>
<h3><b>Adopting BTS's Skincare Regimen for Radiant Skin</b></h3>
<p><span>BTS is a sensation worldwide. Not only for their singing and music, but also for their glowing skin, and they swear it on the extensive beauty rituals that they follow in morning and night that they follow diligently.</span></p>
<p><b>10-Step Night Time Skin Care Routine</b> <br/><span>Night time skin ritual is a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/klairs">must in Korean Skincare</a>. This ensures removal of makeup, pollutants, dirt and debris accumulated throughout the hustle of the day, and provides the essential nutrients to it at night to help restore the skin. Below is the comprehensive guide for the 10 step night ritual of Korean Skin Care</span></p>
<h4><strong># Step 1-  Using Oil Based Cleanser <br/></strong></h4>
<p><span>It involves using an oil cleanser to remove makeup and dirt. Waterproof sunscreen, smudge proof lip colours, and other transfer resistant, oil based makeup, gets removed with ease using an oil based cleanser. Apart from cleansing, other benefits that these cleansers offer are increasing blood flow due to circular massage-likemotions being followed.</span></p>
<p><strong># Step 2- Using a pH Balancing Cleanser</strong></p>
<p><span>To remove the accumulated dirt, sweat and oil based impurities, incorporating a gentle, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-foaming-face-wash">pH balancing cleanser is an important</a> step. This ensures double cleansing, while also incorporating essential oils inside the skin. A pH balancing cleanser ensures that the pH of the skin stays between 4.7-5.7. It could be foaming or soap free.</span></p>
<h4><strong> #Step 3- Exfoliating the Skin</strong></h4>
<p><span>Koreans understand the minute details of having clean skin. For this, they ensure that proper exfoliation is done as it removes not only the surface impurities, but also the dead skin cells that clog the pores. This in turn, improves the turnover of the skin significantly, and makes the skin appear firm and devoid of texture.</span></p>
<p><strong>#Step 4- Toning</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong><span>Using a toner that suits the skin and removes any left over dirt and oil, further improves the appearance of the skin. A toner rich in antioxidants not only performs the usual action of cleaning the skin, but also benefits the skin due a plethora of skin soothing and favourable ingredients. However care must be taken to use an alcohol free toner to prevent drying of the skin. </span><span>COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner</span><span> not only exfoliates the skin but also allows for a better absorption of the products.</span></p>
<p><strong>#Step 5- Applying Essence</strong></p>
<p><span>A rage in the Korean skincare routine, an Essence is a concentrated formula that treats skin on the cellular level. It has an ample of active ingredients that hydrate, nourish and boost the skin health as a whole. After toning and deep cleansing, essence aids in restoring the lost hydration. It also paves a pathway for better absorption of further products. </span><span>COSRX Advanced Snail Radiance Dual Essence</span><span> contains snail secretion filtrate that offers a variety of benefits to the skin.</span></p>
<h4><strong>#Step 6- Using Serum/Ampoule</strong></h4>
<p><span>A concentrated and potent form of essence is referred to as a Serum. This targets various specific skin concerns such as dullness, spots, wrinkles and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">pigmentation.</a> Incorporating this step into the skincare regimen ensures that the skin looks visibly radiant and spot free.</span></p>
<h4><strong>#Step 7- Using a Sheet Mask</strong></h4>
<p><span>Sheet Masks have made a lasting impact on the beauty industry. These are soaked with serum and provide a huge boost of hydration and rich ingredients to the skin, that leaves the skin feeling soft and supple. </span><span>Ultra-V Aqua Shine Mask </span><span>instantly reduces fatigue, tiredness and makes the skin appear radiant and glowy.</span></p>
<p><br/><strong>#Step 8- An Eye Cream</strong></p>
<p><span>The skin around the skin is extremely delicate. As a result, it is the first area that shows the signs of ageing.. <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-ultra-heal-under-eye-cream">An under eye cream </a>addresses these concerns and minimises the appearance of crow’s feet and dark circles.</span></p>
<p><strong>#Step 9- Moisturize</strong></p>
<p><span>Using an occlusive moisturiser, that aids in locking the previous layers of skin care is a crucial step in Korean Beauty Regimen. However, care must be taken to use a moisturiser according to one’s skin type. In case of oily skin, a light gel or lotion based moisturiser is recommended, whereas for oily skin, a heavy cream based moisturiser should be made your best friend. </span></p>
<h4>
<strong>#Step 10- Hydrate Lips</strong><strong><br/></strong>
</h4>
<p><span>Lastly, don’t forget to soak your lips in a hydrating lip balm for those moisturised and plumped lips.</span></p>

<h4>
<span> </span><b>7-Step Day Time Skin Care Routine</b>
</h4>
<p><span>While the night skincare routine is essential, indulging in the morning skincare ritual is also vital as it prepares the skin for the day. The routine is as follows:</span></p>
<h4><strong>#Step 1- Clean the Skin</strong></h4>
<p><strong><br/></strong><span>Cleaning the skin with just plain water is a Korean morning ritual that they follow. Koreans don’t believe in using cleansers in the morning so as to preserve natural oils of the skin. Washing the face with plain water to wake up the skin is a norm there.</span></p>
<h4><strong>#Step 2- Dab the Toner</strong></h4>
<h4><span>Dabbing a mild, pH balancing toner on the skin is essential as it ensures maximum absorption of further products onto the skin. </span></h4>
<h4><strong>#Step 3- Use an Essence</strong></h4>
<p><span>Rich in antioxidants, an essence hydrates, nourishes and boosts the skin's vitality. It provides a boost of nutrition to the skin and prepares it for the day. </span><span>Shangpree CC Silky Essence</span><span> is a great choice for brightening the skin.</span></p>
<p><strong>#Step 4- Apply Serum/ Ampoules</strong></p>
<p><span>Ultra Rich in nutrients and active ingredients, Serum functions as a food for the skin. It targets a specific concern and aids in treating the same.</span></p>
<h4><strong>#Step 5- Use a moisturiser</strong></h4>
<p><span>Apply an occlusive moisturiser to lock all the previous skincare layers in for a consistent supply of antioxidants. However, care must be taken while choosing the consistency of the moisturiser according to one’s skin type.</span></p>
<p><strong>#Step 6- Moisturise the Lips</strong></p>
<p><span>Lastly, don’t forget to apply a hydrating lip balm for attaining those moisturised and plumped lips.</span></p>
<h4><strong>#Step 7- Protect from Sun</strong></h4>
<p><span>While warm sun rays hitting the cold body is a whole level of pure bliss, it often takes a toll on the skin of face and neck, as it is quite delicate. To prevent the harmful effect of sun rays on the skin, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-sunprotect-sunscreen-spf-50">a broad spectrum sunscreen </a>that prevents damaging action of both, UVA and UVB rays, is a staple. It needs to be reapplied after every 2-3 hours to ensure maximal benefit.</span></p>

<h2><b>Korean Beauty Secrets Inspired by BTS<br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="Korean Beauty Secrets Inspired by BTS" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_4_44_480x480.jpg?v=1704957224"/></div>
<p><span>Thanks to social media, BTS has become Gen-X’s favourite. Not only girls, but also guys are gushing over the flawless skin of the singers. This has resulted in exploring and diving deep into the skincare routine followed by them. We, at </span><span>Clinikally</span><span>, present to you certain secrets of much talked about Korean skincare below.</span></p>
<h3><b>Korean Beauty Routines That Keep Korean Looking Fresh </b></h3>
<p><span>As mentioned above, the cult favourite Korean 10-Step Nighttime Skincare Routine and 7-Step Morning Skincare Ritual accomplishes the promised results of hydrated, supple and smooth skin. It provides much sought after glass skin. The skin not only looks dewy, but also is dew-drop fresh from inside.</span></p>
<h3><b>Natural Ingredients in BTS's Skincare Selections</b></h3>
<p><span>Selecting the ingredient from a wide range of options can be a task. While choosing the ingredient, always focus on your skin type.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>If the skin is dry, choose the ingredient that is hydrating and moisturising.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>For the skin that is oily, use the ingredient that though hydrating, does not clog the pores.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>For an acne prone skin, use the ingredient that exhibits antimicrobial and anti-bacterial properties.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>For sensitive skin, use the ingredients that are mild. A patch test is always recommended prior to indulging in a certain ingredient.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>For broken and cracked skin, use the ingredients that do not cause any skin irritation and exhibit skin repairing and wound healing properties.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>For ageing skin, choose the ingredients that enhance collagen production so as to attain a firmer looking skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>The Trend of Men's Skincare in Korea</b></h3>
<p><span>Earlier, skincare was looked upon as a feminine thing. However, Korea, particularly K-Dramas and BTS have challenged this approach and have made skincare a gender-neutral practice. As a result, even boys and men have started caring for their skin. This definitely had a positive impact on society.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Impact of Koreans on Global Skincare Trends</b></h3>
<p><span>Koreans have made a huge impact on global skincare trends. Various brands have made their product line in such a way that all the 7 and 10 steps get incorporated. A positive shift has been made wherein natural products are favoured more than artificial, lab synthesised products. People of all races, genders and countries are going gaga over Korean skincare products as the promised results are being attained.</span></p>
<h2><b>Integrating Korean Beauty Techniques into Your Routine<br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="Integrating Korean Beauty Techniques into Your Routine" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_4_47_480x480.jpg?v=1704957379"/></div>
<p><span>To sum up, incorporating Korean Beauty techniques into the busy routines may be hard at first, but eventually the results will make one do those practices diligently. It demands consistency and regularity to achieve a healthy skin that looks bright, radiant and firm.</span></p>
