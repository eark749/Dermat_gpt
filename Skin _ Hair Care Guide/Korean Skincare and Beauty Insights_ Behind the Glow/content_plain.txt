Korean Approach to Flawless Skin: Key Products and Practices
Koreans believe in using the products that are made in their homeland for their skincare regimen. They hardly apply any other product on to their skin. The main reason behind it is that they believe in the amalgamation of innovation, science and traditional beauty practices. The
Korean Skincare
products
before coming to the shelves get researched upon both qualitatively and quantitatively. Only after complete due diligence, the products are made available for the public.
The benchmark of Korean Skincare is ‘glass skin’. It implies a luminous and glowing skin that appears crystal-clear and translucent with absence of pores, that appears like a clean piece of glass. For this reason, they have certain fundamentals while doing skincare. They are:
Start caring for your skin early
- As opposed to western philosophy, Korean Skincare focuses on pampering and caring for the skin as early as mid- teens. Koreans don’t believe in waiting for the first signs of ageing to appear to start caring for their skin. As a result, they are successful in delaying and combating the process of ageing.
Treat, don’t hide
- Koreans believe that instead of focusing on using makeup to hide the skin flaws, use the skincare products that treat and correct them. They view makeup as a fun component and not as a necessity.
Use natural products
- Koreans are a strict believer of using the products obtained from nature, instead of harsh chemicals. Various plant extracts, animal secretions and essential oils are the building blocks of the
Korean skincare line.
Pat, not smear
- To achieve maximal absorption of skincare products, Koreans believe in patting the skincare products into the skin, instead of smearing it. Smearing the skincare products leads to more of wiping away the product, instead of absorption.
Make-up free at night
- Koreans are very disciplined when it comes to their skincare routine. Removing makeup is a skincare essential before getting the beauty sleep. Clean face makes way for a clear face.
Work out those facial muscles
- A face that is well contoured is the face that appears young. To achieve natural V-shaped chin and popping cheekbones, exercising them is mandatory. These exercises are explained in detail, further deep in the blog.
Consistency is the key
- Koreans are firm believers of being consistent while indulging in skincare. No matter how good the product is, it will not work if one is not constant, diligent and consistent in his routine.To avail maximum benefits of skincare products, a person needs to be regular while using them.

BTS is a sensation worldwide. Not only for their singing and music, but also for their glowing skin, and they swear it on the extensive beauty rituals that they follow in morning and night that they follow diligently.
10-Step Night Time Skin Care Routine
Night time skin ritual is a
must in Korean Skincare
. This ensures removal of makeup, pollutants, dirt and debris accumulated throughout the hustle of the day, and provides the essential nutrients to it at night to help restore the skin. Below is the comprehensive guide for the 10 step night ritual of Korean Skin Care
# Step 1-  Using Oil Based Cleanser
It involves using an oil cleanser to remove makeup and dirt. Waterproof sunscreen, smudge proof lip colours, and other transfer resistant, oil based makeup, gets removed with ease using an oil based cleanser. Apart from cleansing, other benefits that these cleansers offer are increasing blood flow due to circular massage-likemotions being followed.
# Step 2- Using a pH Balancing Cleanser
To remove the accumulated dirt, sweat and oil based impurities, incorporating a gentle,
pH balancing cleanser is an important
step. This ensures double cleansing, while also incorporating essential oils inside the skin. A pH balancing cleanser ensures that the pH of the skin stays between 4.7-5.7. It could be foaming or soap free.
#Step 3- Exfoliating the Skin
Koreans understand the minute details of having clean skin. For this, they ensure that proper exfoliation is done as it removes not only the surface impurities, but also the dead skin cells that clog the pores. This in turn, improves the turnover of the skin significantly, and makes the skin appear firm and devoid of texture.
#Step 4- Toning
Using a toner that suits the skin and removes any left over dirt and oil, further improves the appearance of the skin. A toner rich in antioxidants not only performs the usual action of cleaning the skin, but also benefits the skin due a plethora of skin soothing and favourable ingredients. However care must be taken to use an alcohol free toner to prevent drying of the skin.
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner
not only exfoliates the skin but also allows for a better absorption of the products.
#Step 5- Applying Essence
A rage in the Korean skincare routine, an Essence is a concentrated formula that treats skin on the cellular level. It has an ample of active ingredients that hydrate, nourish and boost the skin health as a whole. After toning and deep cleansing, essence aids in restoring the lost hydration. It also paves a pathway for better absorption of further products.
COSRX Advanced Snail Radiance Dual Essence
contains snail secretion filtrate that offers a variety of benefits to the skin.
#Step 6- Using Serum/Ampoule
A concentrated and potent form of essence is referred to as a Serum. This targets various specific skin concerns such as dullness, spots, wrinkles and
pigmentation.
Incorporating this step into the skincare regimen ensures that the skin looks visibly radiant and spot free.
#Step 7- Using a Sheet Mask
Sheet Masks have made a lasting impact on the beauty industry. These are soaked with serum and provide a huge boost of hydration and rich ingredients to the skin, that leaves the skin feeling soft and supple.
Ultra-V Aqua Shine Mask
instantly reduces fatigue, tiredness and makes the skin appear radiant and glowy.
#Step 8- An Eye Cream
The skin around the skin is extremely delicate. As a result, it is the first area that shows the signs of ageing..
An under eye cream
addresses these concerns and minimises the appearance of crow’s feet and dark circles.
#Step 9- Moisturize
Using an occlusive moisturiser, that aids in locking the previous layers of skin care is a crucial step in Korean Beauty Regimen. However, care must be taken to use a moisturiser according to one’s skin type. In case of oily skin, a light gel or lotion based moisturiser is recommended, whereas for oily skin, a heavy cream based moisturiser should be made your best friend.
#Step 10- Hydrate Lips
Lastly, don’t forget to soak your lips in a hydrating lip balm for those moisturised and plumped lips.
