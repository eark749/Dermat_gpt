Triethanolamine Formulations: Choosing Products with Care
When choosing skincare products containing triethanolamine (TEA), it is important to understand the formulations and the potential effects on your skin. Here is a guide to help you carefully select TEA-containing products:
Emulsifier
: Adding triethanolamine to an ingredient causes chemical bonds to change, allowing fluids that are difficult to mix to be thoroughly processed into a single product. Consider an oil and water salad dressing. Adding triethanolamine causes the immiscible ingredients to mix thoroughly and homogeneously, eliminating the need to shake the container before each use.
pH adjuster
: Triethanolamine has been shown to work effectively with acidic compounds, lowering their pH to a level suitable for sensitive skin. However, it also works in the opposite direction, stabilizing higher pH levels to make them more suitable for skin care.
Stabilizer
: Creating a creamy texture for shaving cream or gel that lasts every time it is used is difficult unless triethanolamine is added to stabilize the mixture and extend its shelf life.
Surfactant
: Triethanolamine reduces a liquid's surface tension, allowing it to blend more easily with another liquid, solid, or gas.
Thickener
: When viscous triethanolamine is added to a product, it gives the formula more body and density. This factor reinforces triethanolamine's use in hand sanitizer, sunscreen, lotions, and ear drops to improve consistency.
