<p><span>When choosing skincare products containing triethanolamine (TEA), it is important to understand the formulations and the potential effects on your skin. Here is a guide to help you carefully select TEA-containing products:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Emulsifier</b><span>: Adding triethanolamine to an ingredient causes chemical bonds to change, allowing fluids that are difficult to mix to be thoroughly processed into a single product. Consider an oil and water salad dressing. Adding triethanolamine causes the immiscible ingredients to mix thoroughly and homogeneously, eliminating the need to shake the container before each use.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>pH adjuster</b><span>: Triethanolamine has been shown to work effectively with acidic compounds, lowering their pH to a level suitable for sensitive skin. However, it also works in the opposite direction, stabilizing higher pH levels to make them more suitable for skin care. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Stabilizer</b><span>: Creating a creamy texture for shaving cream or gel that lasts every time it is used is difficult unless triethanolamine is added to stabilize the mixture and extend its shelf life. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Surfactant</b><span>: Triethanolamine reduces a liquid's surface tension, allowing it to blend more easily with another liquid, solid, or gas. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Thickener</b><span>: When viscous triethanolamine is added to a product, it gives the formula more body and density. This factor reinforces triethanolamine's use in hand sanitizer, sunscreen, lotions, and ear drops to improve consistency.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
