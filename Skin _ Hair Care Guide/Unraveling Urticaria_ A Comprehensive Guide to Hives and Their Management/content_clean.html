<p><span>Urticaria, often known as hives, is a skin disorder that causes swollen, itchy, and frequently red welts on the skin. Hives can form anywhere on the body, vary in size and shape, and are frequently present in clusters. If you have urticaria symptoms, it is critical that you seek medical assistance to discover the cause and obtain appropriate treatment. Most cases of urticaria can be adequately treated and controlled with the proper therapy.</span></p>
<h2><b>Understanding Urticaria and Its Symptoms</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="treatment of urticaria" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/hives_on_skin_1_480x480.png?v=1684412353"/></b></p>
<p><span>Urticaria, also known as hives, is a skin disorder characterized by the formation of red, itchy, and swollen lumps on the skin. These lumps can vary in size and shape and can appear anywhere on the body. Depending on how long it lasts, urticaria can be acute or chronic. Acute urticaria, which typically results from an allergic reaction to food, medication, or insect stings, lasts less than six weeks. The cause of chronic urticaria, which lasts longer than six weeks, may be an autoimmune disease, a thyroid condition, or another medical condition.</span></p>
<p><span>Urticaria signs and symptoms include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Bumpy skin that is red or pink in color</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Itching</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Swelling</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Stinging or burning to feel</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Blistering</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The appearance of redness around the eyes, lips, or tongue (angioedema).</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Other symptoms such as fever, fatigue, joint pain, or difficulty breathing may accompany urticaria in some cases, indicating a more severe allergic reaction.</span></p>
<h3><b>Acute vs. Chronic Urticaria</b></h3>
<p><span>Urticaria is characterized as acute or chronic based on how long the symptoms last. Hives that last less than six weeks are referred to as "acute urticaria." There are numerous potential causes, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>(Viral or bacterial) infections</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are examples of medications.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Insect stings or bites</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Allergies to certain foods (such as nuts, shellfish, eggs, or milk)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Pressure, cold, or heat are examples of physical stimuli.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Stress</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>In contrast, chronic urticaria is described as hives that linger for more than six weeks. Chronic urticaria can be difficult to diagnose, but it may be associated with an underlying autoimmune illness. Other potential causes of persistent urticaria include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Physical cues (like pressure, cold, or heat)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Infections (including hepatitis and HIV)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Thyroid problems</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Chronic idiopathic urticaria (cause unknown)</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Chronic urticaria, which can be persistent and difficult to manage, can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life.</span></p>
<h3><b>Common Triggers and Allergens</b></h3>
<p><span>The following are some of the most common allergens and triggers:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Food allergies</b><span>: Typical food allergens include shellfish, milk, eggs, and peanuts.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Medication</b><span>: A number of drugs, including aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and antibiotics, can cause hives.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Insect bites or stings</b><span>: Mosquitoes, bees, and other insects can cause hives in some people.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Latex</b><span>: Latex-allergic people may experience hives when using latex products such as gloves and condoms.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Heat and cold</b><span>: For some people, extreme temperatures can cause hives.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Stress</b><span>: For some people, emotional stress can cause hives.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Exercise</b><span>: A type of hive called exercise-induced urticaria appears during or after physical activity.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Infections</b><span>: Hives may occasionally result from bacterial or viral infections.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It is significant to note that hives frequently have no known cause. This is known as idiopathic urticaria.</span></p>
<h2><b>Diagnosis and Treatment Options</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="treatment of urticaria" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/hives_on_skin_3_480x480.png?v=1684412383"/></b></p>
<p><span>A physical examination and a review of medical history are used to identify triggers and probable underlying causes of urticaria. To discover the cause of the hives, allergy testing or blood tests may be recommended in some circumstances. Urticaria is often treated by recognizing and avoiding triggers, as well as taking antihistamines to relieve symptoms. Over-the-counter antihistamines such as diphenhydramine or loratadine may be adequate to relieve the symptoms of acute urticaria. Higher doses of antihistamines or other drugs, such as omalizumab, cyclosporine, or corticosteroids, may be recommended for chronic urticaria.</span></p>
<p><span>Other measures to relieve symptoms and prevent flare-ups, in addition to medication, include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Avoiding triggers</b><span>: Make a list of all potential triggers and allergens, and stay away from them.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cool compresses</b><span>: Cool compresses can be used to soothe the skin and stop itching, as can cool baths.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Loose clothing</b><span>: Wear loose, breathable clothing to prevent further irritation of the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Stress management</b><span>: Because stress can aggravate hives, stress management techniques or therapy may help reduce symptoms.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>If your urticaria symptoms are severe or persistent, you should see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and course of treatment. Rarely, hives may be a symptom of a more serious underlying condition that needs additional testing and care.</span></p>
<h3><b>Dermatological Evaluation</b></h3>
<p><span>A dermatological evaluation involves a thorough examination of the skin, hair, and nails. A dermatologist, a medical specialist who specializes in detecting and treating skin disorders, is usually the one who does it. A physical examination of the skin, a review of the patient's medical history, and a discussion of any symptoms or concerns the patient may have are all part of the evaluation.</span></p>
<p><span>The dermatologist will inspect the skin for any anomalies, such as rashes, growths, or discoloration, during the physical examination. They may also employ dermatoscopy, a unique piece of equipment that magnifies the surface of the skin, to better see any anomalies. In addition, the dermatologist may inspect the hair and nails for signs of infection or other problems. Following the physical examination, the dermatologist will usually ask the patient about their medical history, including any prior skin diseases or treatments. They may also inquire about any current medications the patient is on, as some medications might trigger skin problems.</span></p>
<p><span>The dermatologist may propose additional tests or procedures to help diagnose the problem based on the examination and medical history. Blood tests, skin biopsies, and allergy testing may be included. Following a diagnosis, the dermatologist will collaborate with the patient to design a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">treatment plan</a>. Depending on the illness being treated, this may include topical or oral drugs, lifestyle changes, or other therapy. The dermatologist will also usually advise you on how to avoid future skin problems and how to properly care for your skin, hair, and nails.</span></p>
<h3><b>Antihistamines and Allergen Avoidance</b></h3>
<p><span>Antihistamines are the primary treatment for urticaria because they prevent the release of histamine and other substances that cause hives. Antihistamines are available in both prescription and non-prescription forms. and over-the-counter versions, with loratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine being common examples. A doctor may prescribe a stronger antihistamine or a combination of antihistamines in cases of severe or persistent urticaria. Avoiding allergens and triggers is also an important element of urticaria management. Certain meals, drugs, insect bites or stings, and exposure to heat or cold are all common causes. Identifying and avoiding certain triggers can lower the frequency and severity of hives in some individuals.</span></p>
<p><span>Topical or oral corticosteroids, which help reduce inflammation and itching, may also be used to treat urticaria. Omalizumab, an injectable medicine that targets an antibody involved in allergic reactions, may also be used in cases of chronic urticaria. It may also be necessary to treat the underlying illness in rare instances where hives are brought on by a medical condition, such as an autoimmune disorder, in order to control urticaria.</span></p>
