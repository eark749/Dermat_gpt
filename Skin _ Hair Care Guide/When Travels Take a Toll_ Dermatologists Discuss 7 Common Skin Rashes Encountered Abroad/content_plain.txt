Sunburn and Sun Protection
Sunburn is a common skin issue, especially in hot and sunny destinations. To prevent sunburn, apply sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all exposed skin, including your face, neck, and hands. Reapply every two hours or after swimming or sweating. Wear protective clothing, such as hats and long-sleeved shirts, and try to avoid being in the sun during peak hours, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.
If you do get sunburned, take cool showers or baths, use aloe vera or other soothing lotions, and drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help alleviate discomfort.
Insect Bites and Bug Repellent Strategies
To prevent insect bites, use a bug repellent containing DEET, picaridin, or IR3535. Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, tuck pants into socks, and avoid wearing perfumes or scented lotions. Check your skin for ticks and other insects after spending time outdoors.
If you do get bitten, wash the affected area with soap and water, apply a cold compress, and take an antihistamine to relieve itching. If you develop a fever or other symptoms, seek medical attention as soon as possible.
Contact Dermatitis: Causes and Prevention
Contact dermatitis can be caused by exposure to various irritants and allergens, such as certain plants, metals, and chemicals. To prevent contact dermatitis, avoid touching known irritants and allergens, wear protective gloves when necessary, and use mild soaps and detergents.
