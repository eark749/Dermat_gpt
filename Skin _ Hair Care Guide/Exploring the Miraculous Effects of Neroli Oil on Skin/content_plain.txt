Neroli oil, derived from the blooms of bitter orange trees (Citrus aurantium), has been used in aromatherapy and skincare for centuries due to its extraordinary skin effects. The oil is high in antioxidants, vitamins, and other nutrients that promote healthy, bright skin. Before introducing new essential oils into your skincare routine, always
consult with a  skin dermatologist
or skincare specialist, especially if you have sensitive or troubled skin. Including neroli oil in your skincare routine alongside other skin-friendly products will help to maximise its benefits and contribute to a healthier complexion.
Getting to Know Neroli Oil
Neroli oil is a rare and aromatic essential oil extracted from the fragrant blossoms of the bitter orange (Citrus aurantium) tree. Anna Maria de la Tremoille, Princess of Neroli, popularised the use of oil in the 17th century. The bitter orange tree is native to Southeast Asia, but it is currently grown in a variety of climes, including the Mediterranean, North Africa, and Florida. Hand-picking the fragile blossoms, generally in the early morning when their aroma is at its optimum, is required in the manufacturing of neroli oil. The aromatic oil is then extracted from the blooms by steam distillation. Because of the large number of blossoms required to produce a small amount of oil, neroli is one of the more expensive essential oils. Neroli oil is well-known for its soothing and calming floral, sweet, and slightly lemony aroma. Because of its distinct aroma, it is a popular ingredient in perfumes, cosmetics, and aromatherapy products.
What is Neroli Oil?
Anna Maria de la Tremoille, Princess of Nerola, gave this oil the name "neroli." The oil is extracted from the exquisite white blooms of the bitter orange tree using steam distillation. Because it takes a large number of flowers to generate a small amount of oil, neroli is one of the more expensive essential oils. Neroli oil is well-known for its wonderful flowery, sweet, and lemony aroma. Its alluring fragrance makes it a popular ingredient in perfumes, cosmetics, and aromatherapy goods. It is critical to utilise neroli oil carefully and ethically, as with any essential oil. Before applying it to a larger region of skin, perform a patch test, especially if you have sensitive skin or allergies. Before consuming neroli oil, pregnant women and those with certain medical conditions should visit a doctor.
Chemical Composition of Neroli Oil
Neroli oil, derived from the bitter orange tree's blooms (Citrus aurantium var. amara), includes a complex blend of chemical components that contribute to its distinct smell and medicinal effects. Neroli oil's chemical makeup might vary depending on factors such as geographical location, climate, and extraction process. The following are some of the key chemical ingredients in neroli oil:
Linalool

Skin Advantages of Using Neroli Oil
Because of its rich chemical composition, neroli oil provides various skin benefits, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and moisturising characteristics. Moisturising and hydrating, anti-aging, skin regeneration, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, astringent effect, emotional benefits, antioxidant protection, and balancing sebum production are all benefits of neroli oil when used properly and in appropriate concentrations. It's vital to remember that essential oils, like neroli oil, are highly potent and should never be applied to the skin undiluted. Before applying neroli oil to the skin, always dilute it in a carrier oil (such as jojoba or almond oil). Before using neroli oil, perform a patch test to rule out any allergic reactions or sensitivities. Individual outcomes may differ, and some people may be more sensitive to essential oils than others. If you have specific skin concerns or medical conditions, it is best to consult a dermatologist or skincare professional before incorporating neroli oil into your skincare routine.
Anti-Aging and Skin Rejuvenation

Neroli Oil for Skin Elasticity and Brightness
Neroli oil's special chemical makeup and a variety of skin-nourishing properties can help to improve the elasticity and brightness of the skin. Here is how neroli oil can aid in addressing these particular skin issues:
Skin Elasticity
:
Skin elasticity refers to the skin's ability to stretch and return to its original shape. Collagen and elastin production in the skin naturally decreases as we age, resulting in a loss of suppleness and the creation of wrinkles. By promoting collagen formation and offering antioxidant protection, neroli oil can help enhance skin elasticity in the following ways.
Skin Brightness:
A vibrant and glowing complexion is referred to as skin brightness. Pollution, sun exposure, and dead skin cell buildup can all contribute to a dull and lifeless appearance. Neroli oil can increase skin brightness through exfoliating effects, better circulation, and skin regeneration.
How to Use Neroli Oil
Before applying neroli oil for skin elasticity and brightness, dilute it with a carrier oil. Popular carrier oils include jojoba oil, sweet almond oil, or coconut oil. A general rule of thumb is to add 2-3 drops of neroli oil to 1 tablespoon of carrier oil. You can apply the diluted neroli oil to the face and neck, gently massaging it into the skin using upward circular motions. For best results, consider using neroli oil as part of your evening skincare routine, as this allows the oil to work overnight, promoting skin regeneration and improved elasticity.
Neroli Oil in Your Skincare Regime
Because of its multiple skin advantages and lovely smell, neroli oil can be an excellent addition to your skincare regimen. It is, nevertheless, critical to utilise it safely and properly. Here are some ideas for using neroli oil in your skincare routine:
Dilute Before Use:
Neroli oil is potent and should never be applied directly to the skin. Always dilute it with a carrier oil, such as jojoba or sweet almond oil, before applying it to your face or body. A safe dilution ratio is 2-3 drops of neroli oil per 1 tablespoon of carrier oil.
Patch Test
: Perform a patch test before applying neroli oil to a larger area of your skin. Apply a small amount of the diluted oil to the inside of your wrist or elbow, and wait 24 hours to see if you have any allergic reactions or sensitivities.
Nighttime Application
: Include neroli oil in your evening skincare routine. This allows the oil to work overnight to promote skin regeneration and deliver its benefits.
Cleansing
: Add a few drops of neroli oil to your favorite gentle cleanser to boost its soothing and hydrating properties. Before applying it to your face, combine it with the cleanser in your palm.
Moisturiser Booster
: Before applying your moisturiser, add a drop or two of neroli oil to it. This can aid in moisture retention and promote a soft, supple complexion.
Facial Massage
: Massage your face with diluted neroli oil to improve circulation, reduce tension, and promote a radiant complexion.
Face Mask
: For added soothing and skin-nourishing benefits, add a few drops of neroli oil to your homemade face masks.
Aromatherapy
: In addition to topical application, you can enjoy neroli oil's aromatherapeutic benefits by using it in a diffuser or inhaling its aroma directly from the bottle. This can aid in the reduction of stress and the promotion of relaxation.
Avoid Sun Exposure
: Because of its citrus content, neroli oil can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. It is best to use sunscreen or avoid being in the sun altogether when applying neroli oil during the day.
Store Your Neroli Oil Properly
: To maintain the potency and lengthen the shelf life of your neroli oil, store it in a cool, dark location away from direct sunlight.
Selecting Neroli Oil Infused Skincare Products
To reap the full benefits of this valuable essential oil, it is critical to purchase high-quality and reputable neroli oil-infused skincare products. Here are some guidelines to help you make the best choices:
Examine the Ingredients
: Look for products that include neroli oil or Citrus aurantium var. amara oil near the top of the ingredients list. The higher it is, the more concentrated the neroli oil in the product.
Consider the Concentration
: Some products may only contain a trace of neroli oil for the sake of fragrance rather than for its skincare benefits. Look for products that state the percentage or concentration of neroli oil that was used.
Look for Pure Neroli Oil
: To fully experience the benefits of neroli oil, use pure neroli oil or products containing a high percentage of pure neroli oil. This avoids dilution with other ingredients that may or may not provide the same benefits.
Opt for Natural and Organic Products
: Choose skincare products made from natural and organic ingredients because they are less likely to contain harmful additives or synthetic fragrances that may irritate the skin.
Avoid Synthetic Fragrances
: While some products may be labeled "neroli-scented," they may contain synthetic fragrances rather than real neroli oil. Choose products that contain natural neroli oil for a genuine and beneficial experience.
Consider Product Type
: Neroli oil can be found in a variety of skincare products, including serums, moisturisers, facial oils, toners, and masks. Consider your skin type and needs when selecting the best product type for your skincare routine.
Read Reviews
: Look for customer reviews and ratings on the products you are thinking about purchasing. Real-world experiences from other users can provide valuable insights into the product's efficacy and performance.
Test Sensitivity
: Before incorporating a new neroli oil-infused product into your routine, perform a patch test on a small area of your skin to check for any adverse reactions or sensitivities.
Avoid Sunscreen Combos
: Avoid products that combine neroli oil and sunscreen because the citrus content in neroli oil can make your skin more sensitive to the sun and potentially increase your risk of sunburn.
Look for Additional Beneficial Ingredients
: To maximise skincare benefits, look for products that combine neroli oil with other beneficial ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, antioxidants, and natural plant extracts.
Applying Neroli Oil for Maximum Benefits
To get the most out of neroli oil, make sure to apply it correctly and strategically incorporate it into your skincare routine. Here are some pointers to help you get the most out of your neroli oil:
Dilute with a Carrier Oil

Patch Test
: Before applying neroli oil to a larger area of your skin, perform a patch test on a small area, such as your wrist or elbow. This will assist you in determining any allergic reactions or skin sensitivities.
Use in Your Evening Routine
: Consider incorporating neroli oil into your evening skincare routine. Applying it before going to bed allows the oil to work overnight, promoting skin regeneration and providing a soothing and calming effect.
Cleanse Your Face First
: Begin by cleansing your face to remove any makeup, dirt, or impurities. Cleaning your skin prepares it to absorb the benefits of neroli oil more effectively.
Apply to Damp Skin
: Apply neroli oil to slightly damp skin to help lock in moisture and improve absorption. You can apply it after cleansing or before applying a hydrating toner to your face.
Facial Massage
: Massage your face gently while applying neroli oil. The relaxing effects of massage also help with circulation and absorption.
Focus on Specific Areas:
Target areas of concern, such as fine lines or dry patches, when applying neroli oil. You can use your fingertips to apply the oil to specific problem areas.
Combine with Moisturiser or Serum
: Before applying, combine a few drops of neroli oil with your preferred moisturiser or serum for additional advantages. This makes the hydrating and nourishing effects stronger.
Use in DIY Face Masks
: Add neroli oil to your DIY face mask recipes. It can be combined with oatmeal, yoghurt, honey, or other ingredients to make a calming and revitalising mask.
Avoid Direct Sun Exposure
: After using neroli oil on your skin, it is best to stay out of the sun because of the oil's citrus content. If you use neroli oil during the day, follow it up with sunscreen.
Consistency is Essential
: In order to reap the full benefits of neroli oil, you must be consistent. For best results, incorporate it into your skincare routine on a regular basis.
Proper Storage
: To preserve its potency and extend its shelf life, store neroli oil in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight.
