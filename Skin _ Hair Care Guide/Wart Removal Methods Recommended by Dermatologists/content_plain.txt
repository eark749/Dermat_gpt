The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the virus that causes warts, which are benign skin growths. They may be uncomfortable, obtrusive, and contagious. While many warts will eventually disappear on their own, some may need to be treated. For the elimination of warts, dermatologists advise using a number of treatments, including cryotherapy, cantharidin, salicylic acid, curettage, laser therapy, and immunotherapy. It is important to remember that not all warts require treatment; some may eventually disappear on their own. It is advised to speak with a dermatologist if you are unsure whether a wart needs to be treated. Furthermore, it's critical to maintain good hygiene if you want to stop the spread of warts to other people.
Understanding the Stubbornness of Warts
The human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common skin infection that can result in warts. They can appear anywhere on the body and can be identified by small, raised, rough growths on the skin. Warts can be obstinate and challenging to remove, but they are mostly harmless and can go away on their own without treatment. This is because the virus that causes warts can persist dormant in the body for extended periods of time and be challenging to remove entirely. Additionally, some wart varieties can penetrate the skin deeply, making removal more challenging. Therefore, when dealing with persistent warts, it's important to get professional medical advice.
Causes of Warts
A viral infection of the skin cells results in warts. The highly contagious human papillomavirus (HPV), which can spread through close contact with an infected person or object, is specifically responsible for their development. There are more than 100 different HPV strains, and they can all result in warts on various body areas. Additionally linked to the emergence of cancer, including cervical cancer, are specific HPV strains.
Types of Warts
There are various
skin wart
types that can appear, including:
Common warts
: These warts are raised, scaly bumps that commonly develop on the hands, elbows, and fingers. They may be grey or brown in colour and typically resemble cauliflower.
Plantar warts
: These warts, which grow on the bottoms of the feet, can be uncomfortable to walk or stand on. These growths can take the form of small, granular bumps or larger, flat growths with a rough surface.
Flat warts
: These warts have a flat top and are small and smooth. They can be pink, brown, or yellow in colour and frequently affect the face, neck, or hands.
Filiform warts
: These warts are long and thin and frequently develop on the face, neck, or eyelids. They can be flesh-coloured or brown and may resemble threads.
Periungual warts
: These painful warts grow around the nails. They might make the nail bend or even fall off as a result.
Genital warts
: The human papillomavirus (HPV) causes these warts, which are spread through sexual contact. They might be flat or elevated, tiny or huge, single or many, and they can show up on the genitalia, anus, or mouth.
Risks Associated with Warts
The majority of warts are benign and do not pose any serious health problems. However, some wart varieties can hurt, itch, or even bleed, particularly if they are found in sensitive or frequently rubbed areas. Furthermore, warts can be unsightly and lower someone's confidence or self-esteem, especially if they are on the face or other prominent parts of the body. Rarely, warts may be a symptom of a serious medical condition that needs to be treated, such as an infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) or a weakened immune system.
Dermatologist-Recommended Treatments for Warts
Depending on the form and intensity of the wart, dermatologists may suggest a variety of treatments. Here are a few of the treatments that are frequently suggested:
Salicylic acid
: This over-the-counter remedy comes in liquid, gel, pads, and ointments. It can be used at home and aids in the breakdown of the protein that makes up the wart.
Cryotherapy
: This involves using liquid nitrogen to freeze the wart. The wart falls off within a week or two as the liquid nitrogen kills the wart's cells. The usual setting for this treatment is a dermatologist's office.
Cantharidin
: To make a blister, this chemical is applied to the wart. The blister lifts the wart from the skin, allowing the dermatologist to remove it.
Curettage and electrodesiccation
: This procedure involves scraping the wart with a curette and then burning the base with an electric needle. The procedure is carried out under local anaesthesia.
Laser therapy
: A laser is used to destroy the blood vessels that feed the wart. The wart eventually dies and falls off.
Immunotherapy
: This treatment stimulates the immune system to attack the wart. It may entail injecting an antigen into the wart, causing the immune system to attack it.
It's important to note that these treatments may have side effects like pain, scarring, or skin discoloration. As a result, before undergoing any treatment, it is critical to discuss the risks and benefits of each treatment option with a dermatologist.
Cryotherapy for Warts
In cryotherapy, which is a popular wart treatment, the wart tissue is frozen to kill the cells and encourage the wart to fall off. The dermatologist applies liquid nitrogen or another type of cryogen to the wart during the procedure using a cotton swab, spray, or probe. Although the freezing procedure can be uncomfortable and take a few minutes, once the area has thawed, the discomfort should subside. To totally eradicate the wart, several treatments could be necessary. Although blisters, scarring, and color changes to the skin can occur from cryotherapy, it is generally safe and effective. It may not be appropriate for people with certain medical conditions or those who are pregnant. A trained healthcare professional must perform the procedure.
Salicylic Acid Treatment for Warts
Warts are frequently treated with salicylic acid, a keratolytic drug. It functions by dissolving the protein (keratin) that makes up the wart, which aids in the wart's progressive removal from the skin. For the treatment of warts, salicylic acid is available in a variety of forms, including gels, ointments, pads, and solutions. To increase their potency, some products may additionally include additional chemicals like lactic acid or urea.
The affected area is often bathed in warm water for several minutes to soften the skin prior to using salicylic acid to remove warts. Following the direct application of the salicylic acid product to the wart, it is wrapped up with tape or a bandage. Depending on the product and directions, the product may be left on the skin for many hours or overnight. To aid in the removal of any dead skin cells and improve the penetration of the salicylic acid, the region is gently scrubbed with an emery board or pumice stone after the substance has been removed. Depending on the size and location of the wart, this procedure is continued daily or every other day until the wart is entirely gone, which could take a few weeks to several months.
As misuse or excessive use of the salicylic acid product can result in skin irritation, burning, or other side effects, it is crucial to carefully follow the instructions that come with it. Without previously visiting a dermatologist, salicylic acid should also not be applied to some forms of warts, such as genital warts or warts on the face.
Laser Treatment for Warts
Another method for removing warts is laser treatment, which uses a concentrated beam of light to harm the wart tissue. A dermatologist or other healthcare professional with specialized training in using lasers often administers laser therapy. The wart is targeted with the laser throughout the process, and the intense light warms the blood vessels supplying the wart tissue. The wart tissue is destroyed as a result, and it eventually falls off or is simple to remove.
Warts that are difficult to treat with other methods of treatment may respond well to laser treatment. It is frequently suggested when other treatments have failed for warts on the hands, feet, and face. However, laser therapy does carry some risks, and possible side effects include discomfort, redness, swelling, scarring, and variations in skin pigment. Additionally, it might not be appropriate for people with specific medical conditions or for people with particular types of warts. Before receiving laser therapy, it's crucial to talk with a medical practitioner about its advantages and disadvantages.
Topical Medications for Warts
Warts are commonly treated with topical medications. The following are some dermatologist-recommended topical medications for warts:
Imiquimod
: This cream is available only by prescription and works to strengthen the immune system's defences against the wart-causing virus.
Bleomycin
: This antibiotic is injected directly into the wart. The wart shrinks and eventually falls off as a result of the blood vessels that supply it with nutrients being destroyed.
Podophyllin
: This topical medication is rubbed right on the wart. It eliminates the skin cells that are responsible for the wart.
Cantharidin
: This topical treatment is rubbed right on the wart. It results in blistering of the skin just below the wart, which eventually results in the wart peeling off.
Retinoids
: These creams are prescribed medications used to treat a range of skin issues, including warts. They function by lowering the production of skin cells, which can aid in the wart's reduction.
It's important to remember that some of these medications have the potential to irritate the skin, so follow your dermatologist's instructions exactly.
Immunotherapy for Warts
A type of treatment called immunotherapy works to strengthen the body's defences against warts. Candida antigen immunotherapy, which includes injecting a tiny amount of Candida antigen directly into the wart, is one of the most popular types of immunotherapy for warts. The Candida antigen aids in boosting the immune system, which in turn aids in warding off the wart-causing virus. Contact immunotherapy is another type of immunotherapy that includes putting a sensitising substance on the skin surrounding the wart. An allergic reaction brought on by the sensitising substance prompts the body's defence mechanisms to attack the wart-causing virus. Usually, contact immunotherapy is used to treat more persistent or resistant warts.
Immunotherapy is typically regarded as safe, but the injection site may experience some discomfort or suffering. Around the treated area, it may also result in redness, swelling, or itching. It is crucial to explore the potential advantages and disadvantages of immunotherapy with a dermatologist before deciding if it is the best course of action for a particular wart situation.
Surgical Removal of Warts
When various therapies fail to work or the warts are too large or deep to be treated effectively, surgical removal of the wart is a possibility. Dermatologists may employ a variety of surgical removal procedures, including:
Excision
: Using a scalpel or other surgical instrument, the wart is cut out of the skin during this procedure. The area can then either be stitched or allowed to heal naturally.
Curettage
: This procedure involves using a sharp, spoon-shaped tool called a curette to scrape the wart tissue away. To eliminate any remaining virus, the area may be treated with an electric needle.
Electrosurgery
: This procedure involves burning the wart tissue with an electric current, which destroys the tissue and cauterise the wound to prevent bleeding.
Laser surgery
: A laser is used to burn off the wart tissue. Laser surgery is typically reserved for warts that have failed to respond to other treatments.
Following surgical removal, the area will be dressed, and the patient will be required to follow post-operative instructions to ensure proper healing. Scarring may occur, depending on the size and location of the wart.
Electrocautery and Chemical Peels for Wart Removal
Electrocautery and chemical peels are two other methods for removing warts that dermatologists may recommend.
Electrocautery is the use of an electric current to burn and destroy wart tissue. The area is numbed with a local anaesthetic, and the procedure usually takes only a few minutes. Following treatment, the treated area may be sore and scab over for a few days, but healing usually takes two weeks.
Chemical peels dissolve the top layer of skin and destroy wart tissue by using a solution containing trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or other similar chemicals. Multiple applications may be required, and the skin may appear red, blistered, or scabbed for several days after treatment. It may take several weeks for the skin to completely heal.
Both of these procedures have a chance of working, but they also come with a greater chance of leaving scars or discoloring the skin than some of the other earlier-mentioned procedures. As with any wart removal procedure, it's crucial to
consult a dermatologist
to determine which strategy will work best for you.
Over-the-Counter Wart Removal Treatments
For those who would rather cure their warts at home, over-the-counter (OTC) wart removal remedies are readily available. Others operate by boosting the immune system to combat the virus that is causing the wart. Some over-the-counter therapies are intended to freeze, burn, or chemically peel the wart off. It is crucial to remember that over-the-counter medications may not be as effective as prescription medications and may take weeks or months to take effect. The following are typical OTC remedies for wart removal:
Salicylic acid
: Salicylic acid is a popular over-the-counter wart treatment. It is available in gels, pads, drops, and plasters. Salicylic acid softens the skin cells surrounding the wart, allowing it to peel away. It may take several weeks of daily application for the wart to completely disappear.
Cryotherapy
: Some over-the-counter products use liquid nitrogen to freeze warts. These products are typically available in spray or applicator form. Cryotherapy works by freezing the wart and causing it to fall off over time. Multiple treatments may be required for complete removal.
Duct tape
: For wart removal, some people swear by the duct tape method. This entails covering the wart with duct tape for several days, removing it, and then filing the wart down with a pumice stone. The procedure is repeated until the wart is gone.
Homoeopathic remedies
: Some people use homoeopathic remedies to remove warts, such as tea tree oil, apple cider vinegar, or garlic. The effectiveness of these remedies is supported by limited scientific evidence, and they may cause skin irritation.
It is important to follow the instructions on OTC wart removal products carefully and to avoid using them on sensitive areas of the skin or on moles or birthmarks. If the wart does not respond to OTC treatments or if it is causing discomfort, it is best to consult a dermatologist for professional treatment.
Preventing the Occurrence of Warts
Preventing the occurrence of warts can be challenging because the human papillomavirus (HPV) is highly contagious and can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact or sharing personal items like towels and shoes. However, here are some tips that can help reduce the risk of getting warts:
Keep your hands clean
: Proper hand washing can aid in the prevention of HPV transmission. Wash your hands with soap and water on a regular basis, especially after touching warts.
Avoid biting your nails
: Biting your nails can cause small skin openings that allow the virus to enter.
Wear shoes in public places
: Avoid walking barefoot in public areas such as swimming pools, locker rooms, and communal showers.
Don't share personal items
: Items like towels, socks, and shoes should never be shared.
Use protection during sexual activity
: Because the HPV virus can be transmitted through sexual contact, using condoms or dental dams can help reduce the risk of developing genital warts.
Boost your immune system
: A healthy diet, enough sleep, regular exercise, and stress management can all help to fortify your immune system and lower your risk of contracting warts.
Treat warts as soon as possible
: If you notice a wart on your skin, seek treatment as soon as possible to prevent the virus from spreading to other parts of your body or to others.
