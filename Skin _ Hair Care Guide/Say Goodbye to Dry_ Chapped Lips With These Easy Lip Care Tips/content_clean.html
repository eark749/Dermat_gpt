<p><span>The skin on your lips is much thinner and more delicate than the skin on the rest of your body. This is why lips are more susceptible to drying out and becoming chapped. In fact, the lips are one of the first places on the body to show signs of dehydration.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the main reasons for this susceptibility is the lack of sebaceous glands on the lips. Sebaceous glands produce oil that helps to keep the skin moisturized and protected. Since the lips don't have these glands, they are not able to produce their own moisture, making them more vulnerable to drying out.</span></p>
<p><span>Another reason why lips are more susceptible to drying out is because they are constantly exposed to the elements. The lips are always exposed to the air, whether you are outside or inside, and this can cause them to lose moisture quickly. In addition, the lips are also exposed to wind, sun, and cold weather, all of which can contribute to drying out and chapping. In this article we will discuss easy lip care tips to keep your lips soft and supple.</span></p>

Here are a few tips to help you prevent dry, chapped lips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Drink plenty of water</b><span>: Dehydration is one of the main causes of dry, chapped lips. To prevent this, make sure you are getting <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/benefits-of-drinking-water-skin-hydration">enough water</a> throughout the day. Aim for at least 8-10 cups of water per day.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use lip balm</b><span>: <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/lip-balm">Lip balm</a> is a great way to keep your lips moisturized and protected. Look for a balm that contains natural ingredients, such as shea butter or beeswax, which will help to soothe and moisturize the lips.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid licking your lips</b><span>: Licking your lips might feel good in the moment, but it can actually make them drier in the long run. When you lick your lips, you are removing the natural oils that help to keep them moisturized. Instead, use a lip balm to keep your lips hydrated.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Use lip balm with SPF</b><span>: The sun can be damaging to your lips, just as it is to the rest of your skin. To protect your lips from the sun's harmful UV rays, look for a <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/blistex-medicated-lip-balm-spf-15">lip balm that contains SPF</a>. This will help to prevent sunburn and keep your lips healthy and hydrated.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid drying ingredients</b><span>: Some ingredients, such as alcohol and menthol, can be drying to the lips. Avoid using products that contain these ingredients, as they can exacerbate dryness and chapping.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>By following these tips, you can help to prevent dry, chapped lips and keep your lips healthy and hydrated. Don't let dry, chapped lips ruin your day – take care of them and enjoy soft, smooth lips all year round.</span></p>
<h3><b>Identifying the causes of dry lips</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Identifying the causes of dry lips" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/X_480x480_411329d0-e518-47d5-b9ac-b1b3fa18392a_480x480.webp?v=1702974557"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Dry lips, also known as chapped lips, can be caused by a variety of factors, and understanding the underlying causes can help you treat and prevent the problem. The following are some of the most common causes of dry lips:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Lack of Moisture</b><span>: Lip dehydration can occur when there is insufficient moisture in the air, particularly in dry or cold climates. Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air in your home. Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Licking Lips</b><span>: Excessive licking of the lips can remove natural oils, causing dryness. Lip licking should be avoided because saliva evaporates quickly, leaving the lips even drier. Instead, apply a hydrating lip balm to your lips.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sun Exposure</b><span>: Prolonged sun exposure can cause sunburn on the lips, resulting in dryness. Use a broad-brimmed hat, apply SPF-containing lip balm, and stay out of the sun for as long as possible.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Wind Exposure</b><span>: Dry lips can be caused by wind removing moisture from the lips. To protect your lips from the wind, wrap a scarf around yourself or use a protective lip balm.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Extreme Weather Conditions</b><span>: Cold, dry weather can aggravate lip dryness and chapping. In cold weather, apply a moisturising lip balm and cover your lips.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Dehydration</b><span>: In general, dehydration can affect the moisture levels in the body, including the lips. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Breathing with the Mouth</b><span>:</span> <span>Breathing through the mouth, especially while sleeping, can contribute to dry lips. Stay hydrated, and think about using a humidifier in your bedroom.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Allergic Reactions</b><span>:</span> <span>Allergies to specific lip care products, toothpaste, or foods can cause irritation and dryness. Allergens should be identified and avoided. Lip care products that are hypoallergenic should be used.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Medications</b><span>:</span> <span>Some medications may cause dry lips as a side effect. If you suspect that a medication is causing dry lips, talk to your doctor about possible alternatives or solutions.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Nutrient Deficiency</b><span>: A lack of essential nutrients such as vitamins B and C can contribute to dry, chapped lips. Maintain a healthy diet that is high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Smoking</b><span>: Smoking can irritate and dry out the lips. Quitting smoking can improve the overall health of your skin and lips.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Overuse of Matte Lipsticks</b><span>:</span> <span>Some lipsticks, particularly matte formulations, can be drying. Choose hydrating lip products and avoid wearing heavy lipsticks.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Harsh Lip Scrubs</b><span>: Excessive or harsh lip scrubs can strip away natural oils. Apply gentle lip exfoliants sparingly, and then apply a moisturising lip balm.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>If you have persistent or severe dry lips despite home remedies, you should see a doctor because there could be an underlying medical condition that needs to be addressed.</span></p>
<h3><b>Natural ingredients for lip hydration</b></h3>

<h2><b>3-step lip care routine for soft supple lips</b></h2>
<div><img alt="3-step lip care routine for soft supple lips" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/60_b1fd315e-3a32-4a72-b01e-d3bcfe84446f_480x480.png?v=1702980390"/></div>
<p><span>Just like your skin, your lips too require a routine to keep them healthy and fresh. If you don't wish to get into an elaborate plan, you can follow a simple 3-step lip care routine that includes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Exfoliate</b><span>: First and most importantly, use a lip exfoliator or make a DIY lip scrub and give your lips a nice rinse. Let this lip care routine step help you get rid of dead skin cells and other impurities off your lips. Remember to not be too harsh with your exfoliation as it can go horribly wrong if you over-exfoliate the sensitive skin on your lips.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Moisturise</b><span>: Once you're done with exfoliation, treat your lips to moisturizing therapy. For this, you can use a super moisturizing lip mask. Here's a recipe for a DIY lip mask - Mix five to six drops of coconut oil with 2-3 drops of any essential oil that you like. Apply this lip mask all over your lips and let it sit for 20 minutes before you gently wipe off the extra bits.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydrate</b><span>: The last step of this lip care routine is to use a lip balm that soothes your skin and locks in moisture. Make sure you invest in a hydrating lip balm that you can use daily to get soft and hydrated lips. While you're at it, make sure to drink enough water throughout the day to keep your body hydrated from the inside.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>To make your lips pink in five minutes, you can rub a slice of cucumber on your lips every single day for five minutes. You can also mix equal amounts of almond oil and coconut oil and apply them all over your lips before bedtime. This will hydrate your lips and give them a rosy sheen too.</span></p>
<p><span>You can <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/lip-wash-in-your-skincare-regimen">brush your lips</a> with a toothbrush to get rid of dry skin and make them softer and smoother. Make sure you're very gentle with the brushing as over-exfoliation can irritate the delicate skin on your lips. It's better to limit brushing your lips to just once a week otherwise it could lead to irritation.</span></p>
<p><span>The colour of lips can differ from person to person. The range lies between very light pink to brown. This is because your lips are made up of three to five cellular layers unlike the rest of your skin which is made of multiple layers.</span></p>
<h3><b>The importance of exfoliation in lip care</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="The importance of exfoliation in lip care" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/61_a653eec4-4a16-40dc-8976-0804d4cb7f64_480x480.png?v=1702980415"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Exfoliation is important in lip care because it removes dead skin cells, increases cell turnover, and improves the general health and appearance of the lips. Exfoliation is beneficial in lip care for various reasons, including:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Removes Dead Skin Cells</b><span>: <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/the-ultimate-guide-to-removing-dead-skin-cells">Dead skin cells</a> can build on the lips over time, causing dryness, flakiness, and a dull appearance. Exfoliating the lips gently removes dead skin cells, revealing smoother and softer skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Improves Lip Texture</b><span>: Regular exfoliation helps improve the texture of the lips, making them feel smoother and more supple. The removal of rough and uneven skin improves the overall feel of the lips.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Enhances Lip Color</b><span>: Exfoliation can increase blood flow to the lips, giving them a natural rosy tint. By promoting circulation, exfoliation contributes to healthier-looking, more vibrant lips.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Prevents Lip Dryness and Chapping</b><span>: Dry and chapped lips are commonly caused by an accumulation of dead skin cells and a lack of moisture. Exfoliation regularly helps to prevent and relieve dry skin by sloughing off dead skin and allowing moisturising products to enter more effectively.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Aids in Lip Product Absorption</b><span>: Lip balms, oils, and other moisturising treatments absorb better on exfoliated lips. Exfoliation improves the absorption of lip care products by providing a smoother surface, maximising their effectiveness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Prepares Lips for Makeup Application</b><span>: Lips that are smooth and exfoliated create a better canvas for applying lipstick, lip gloss, or other lip makeup products. Exfoliated lips allow makeup to adhere more evenly and remain longer, resulting in a more polished image.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reduces the Appearance of Fine Lines</b><span>: Fine lines and wrinkles can be more visible on dry, uneven lips. Exfoliation regularly helps to reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles by creating smoother, more youthful-looking lips.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Addresses Discoloration</b><span>: The collection of dead skin cells can produce discoloration or uneven pigmentation. Exfoliation, by removing the outer layer of skin, can help achieve a more equal skin tone on the lips.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Promotes Lip Health</b><span>: Regular exfoliation is part of a full lip care routine, and healthy lips are crucial for general well-being. It promotes overall lip health by keeping the surface balanced and moisturised.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Encourages Collagen Production</b><span>: Lip firmness and suppleness can be maintained by stimulating collagen synthesis. Exfoliation regularly may stimulate collagen formation, resulting in plumper, more youthful-looking lips.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>While exfoliation is good, it is critical to exfoliate the lips gently due to their sensitive skin. Exfoliating the lips with a lip scrub or a soft toothbrush in circular motions, or applying a homemade sugar scrub, are both good methods. It's best to follow up with a moisturising lip balm to seal in the moisture. Individual needs determine exfoliation frequency; however, it is generally recommended to exfoliate the lips 1-3 times weekly.</span></p>
<h3><b>Nourishing lip balms and treatments</b></h3>

<p><span><img alt="Nourishing lip balms and treatments" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/62_70891715-19a4-47d5-b8c1-f18e93d7a73d_480x480.png?v=1702980463"/></span></p>
