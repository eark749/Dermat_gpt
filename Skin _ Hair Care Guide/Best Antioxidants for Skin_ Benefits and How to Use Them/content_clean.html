<p><span>Antioxidants work by donating one of their own electrons to the free radicals, making them stable and less harmful. Natural antioxidants for skin are found in many natural sources such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, herbs, and other antioxidant-rich foods - as well as in some skincare products and supplements for skin.</span></p>
<p><span>Some examples of antioxidants include vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and various plant-based compounds such as flavonoids, polyphenols, and carotenoids. These antioxidants have different chemical properties and can target specific types of free radicals, providing a range of health benefits.</span></p>
<h3><b>Antioxidants and anti-aging: How they work</b></h3>
<p><span>In the context of anti-aging, antioxidants are important because they counteract the effects of oxidative stress, a major factor in the ageing process. The following is how antioxidants function in anti-aging:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Neutralizing Free Radicals</b><span>: Free radicals are defined as unstable molecules that are created either as a byproduct of biological processes or as a reaction to external stimuli such as smoke, pollution, and UV rays. By giving up their electrons, antioxidants counteract free radicals and stop them from damaging cellular structures.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Preventing Oxidative Stress</b><span>: Damage to cells results from oxidative stress, which happens when the equilibrium between antioxidants and free radicals is upset. By assisting in the maintenance of this equilibrium, antioxidants shield skin cells from the damaging effects of oxidative stress.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Collagen Synthesis and Maintenance</b><span>: The structural protein collagen gives skin its elasticity and firmness. This makes collagen important. Certain antioxidants, like vitamin C, prevent matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) from breaking down pre-existing collagen and promote its synthesis.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reducing Fine Lines and Wrinkles</b><span>: Free radicals can damage DNA, which accelerates the ageing process and causes fine lines and wrinkles to appear. By preventing DNA damage, antioxidants help to minimise the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Brightening and Even Skin Tone</b><span>: Free radicals can trigger excessive melanin production, which can lead to hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. Antioxidants, particularly vitamin C, prevent the production of melanin, which results in skin that is more even and brighter in tone.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Anti-Inflammatory Effects</b><span>: Prolonged inflammation is linked to a faster ageing process. Due to their anti-inflammatory qualities, antioxidants can help to lessen redness and inflammation brought on by ageing and skin disorders.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Enhancing Sun Protection</b><span>: Sunlight exposure causes wrinkles, sunspots, and a reduction in the elasticity of the skin, all of which are major causes of premature ageing. When paired with sunscreen, antioxidants improve defences against UV-induced oxidative stress and lessen its effects.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Supporting Skin Barrier Function</b><span>: Moisture retention and defence against environmental stressors depend on a healthy skin barrier.  Antioxidants help to keep the skin barrier intact, avoiding dehydration and enhancing general skin health.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Preventing Glycation</b><span>: Glycation is the process by which sugars attach themselves to proteins, resulting in the production of AGEs (advanced glycation end products), which are linked to ageing. Alpha-lipoic acid is one antioxidant that may be able to prevent glycation and therefore slow down the ageing process.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Protecting Against Environmental Aggressors</b><span>: Antioxidants serve as a barrier to shield the skin from oxidative stressors found in the environment.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Promoting Wound Healing</b><span>:</span> <span>Antioxidants promote quicker wound healing and less scarring by helping to repair damaged skin cells and tissues.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Overall Skin Wellness</b><span>: Antioxidants offer complete protection against multiple ageing factors, which contributes to the overall wellness of the skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Antioxidants work by neutralizing free radicals, preventing oxidative stress, supporting collagen synthesis, reducing inflammation, and addressing various factors associated with aging. Incorporating a variety of antioxidants into your skincare routine can provide comprehensive protection and promote a more youthful and radiant complexion.</span></p>
<h3><b>Antioxidants in sun protection and repair</b></h3>
<p><span>Antioxidants play an important role in sun protection and repair by providing additional defence against the damaging effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and aiding in the mitigation of sun exposure's repercussions. Here are some ways antioxidants help with UV protection and repair:</span></p>
<p><b>Sun Protection</b><span>:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Increasing UV Protection</b><span>: UV light produces free radicals, which cause oxidative stress and cellular damage in the skin. Antioxidants neutralise free radicals, adding another layer of protection against UV-induced damage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Improving Sunscreen Efficacy</b><span>: Antioxidants improve sunscreens' ability to shield the skin from UV rays when used together. Sunscreen and antioxidants combine to provide combined UVA and UVB protection.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Neutralizing Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)</b><span>: UV radiation can cause the creation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which contributes to oxidative stress. Antioxidants reduce the risk of UV-induced damage and premature ageing by neutralising ROS.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Preventing Photoaging</b><span>: UV rays are a key cause of photoaging, which is characterised by wrinkles, sunspots, and loss of skin flexibility. By counteracting the effects of UV exposure, antioxidants assist to prevent and minimise photoaging.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Protecting Collagen and Elastin</b><span>:</span> <span>UV rays can cause collagen and elastin fibres to break down, resulting in sagging and wrinkles. Antioxidants prevent the breakdown of collagen and elastin, enhancing skin firmness and suppleness.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reducing Sunburn</b><span>: Skin irritation and sunburn can result from UV exposure. Antioxidants contain anti-inflammatory qualities, which aid in the reduction of redness and inflammation caused by sunburn.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Repair and Recovery</b><span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Addressing DNA Damage</span><span>: UV rays can damage DNA in skin cells, raising the risk of skin cancer. Antioxidants may aid in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage, lowering the risk of skin cancer.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Cellular Repair and Regeneration</span><span>: Antioxidants contribute to cellular repair processes, helping damaged skin cells recover. Certain antioxidants aid in the production of fresh, healthy skin cells.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Minimizing Hyperpigmentation</span><span>: Hyperpigmentation and the appearance of dark spots can result from UV exposure. Some antioxidants prevent the synthesis of melanin, which lessens the appearance of hyperpigmentation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Calming Inflammation</span><span>: The skin becomes inflamed when exposed to UV radiation. Antioxidants lessen redness and discomfort by calming inflammation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Enhancing Wound Healing</span><span>: UV ray damage can prevent wounds from healing normally. Antioxidants help wounds heal and may speed up the healing process for sun-damaged skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Moisture and Barrier Restoration</span><span>: Skin dehydration and damage to the skin barrier can result from prolonged sun exposure. Certain antioxidants support the repair of the skin barrier and help to hydrate the skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Incorporating antioxidants into your skincare routine, both topically and through a high-antioxidant diet, can help to prevent UV damage and heal sun-damaged skin. While antioxidants are beneficial, they should be used in conjunction with, rather than in instead of, sunscreen for comprehensive UV protection.</span></p>
