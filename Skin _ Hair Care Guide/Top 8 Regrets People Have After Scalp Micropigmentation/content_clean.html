<p><span>Scalp micropigmentation is a cosmetic procedure for thinning or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-fall-hair-loss">hair loss</a>. It is sometimes referred to as a hair tattoo. A provider uses thin, little needles to apply tiny dots of <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">pigment</a> (color) to the scalp. These dots create the appearance of fuller hair. Scalp micropigmentation pigments are permanent inks made for cosmetic use.</span></p>

<p><span>During scalp micropigmentation, a practitioner uses a fine needle to deposit tiny dots of color onto the scalp. The dots vary in size and depth, giving the appearance of fuller hair. Scalp micropigmentation can conceal thinning parts of your scalp, birthmarks, and scars. It can also be used to give the appearance of a buzz cut to someone <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/bald-patches">bald</a>.</span></p>
<h3><b>How SMP Works for Hair Loss</b></h3>

<p><span>Scalp micropigmentation is a technique for permanently concealing weak hair and bare patches. The process does not require surgery or anesthesia, so you may rapidly resume your daily lifestyle. There are seldom negative effects from tattooing, but slight redness can persist for many hours.   Hair loss is typically progressive, which means it worsens with time. Millions of people suffer from conditions that cause hair loss, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/alopecia-areata">Alopecia areata</a> is an autoimmune disorder that leads to hair loss. Autoimmune illnesses cause the body to attack itself. In the case of alopecia areata, the body assaults the hair follicles, causing unpredictable hair loss. For some people, the follicles mend and hair regrows, while for others, hair loss is permanent.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Chemotherapy targets quickly-growing cancer cells in the body. It also targets other types of quickly growing cells, such as the ones in your hair roots. Chemotherapy does not always cause hair loss, and it is typically only temporary.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>While most people associate hair loss with men, more than half of women also suffer from it. Female pattern hair loss can affect any woman, although it is most common in women over the age of 40, those going through menopause, and those who have a family history of the condition.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Male pattern hair loss is the most common reason for hair loss in men. More than half of white males exhibit indicators of male pattern hair loss, such as thinning hair, baldness, or a receding hairline.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">Scars</a> or birthmarks on the scalp may show through the hair. Scalp micropigmentation can conceal these markings.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Common Regrets After Scalp Micropigmentation</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Common Regrets After Scalp Micropigmentation" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Common_Regrets_After_Scalp_Micropigmentation_480x480.jpg?v=1723188414"/></div>
<p><span>Scalp micropigmentation is becoming a more common alternative to hair transplants. Rather than enhancing true hair density by transplanting hair into thinning areas of your head, scalp micropigmentation (SMP) produces the illusion of density by tattooing tiny dots throughout the scalp. SMP is a good option for many patients. Unfortunately, some people report regretting their scalp micropigmentation operation. This could be due to a lack of study, questionable clinics providing deceptive information or selecting the incorrect surgery. Some of the most common scalp micropigmentation mistakes, and how to avoid them.</span></p>
<h3><b>Regret #1: Unrealistic Expectations</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Regret #1: Unrealistic Expectations" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Regret_1_Unrealistic_Expectations_480x480.jpg?v=1723188413"/></div>
<p><span>Scalp micropigmentation might look like denser hair or shaven hair. However, just as it would be strange to shave only a portion of one's head, SMP appears strange when there is a mix of haired (long hair) and non-haired (closely shaven) parts on the scalp.</span></p>
<h3><span><strong>Regret</strong> <strong>#2: Choosing an Inexperienced Technician</strong></span></h3>
<div><img alt="Regret #2: Choosing an Inexperienced Technician" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Regret_2_Choosing_an_Inexperienced_Technician_480x480.jpg?v=1723188413"/></div>
<p><span>As with any kind of cosmetic procedure, your technician should use the appropriate technique for SMP. If your technician has poor SMP technique, you could end up with unnatural-looking hair. This patient’s SMP has quite a few problems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The needle was inserted too far beneath the skin, resulting in large, blotchy droplets.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The tattoos have a blue tint due to incorrect pigment color.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The design seems unduly structured and nearly grid-like.</span></p>
</li>
<li><span>An extremely unnatural-looking hairline that is crooked and uneven.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Regret #3: Improper Aftercare</b></h3>

<p><span>Following treatment, do not touch, scratch, shave, or comb the scalp. You do not want to introduce any bacteria or germs that may cause an infection. If your scalp is itchy, gently pat it, but do not use your fingernails. Otherwise, you could scratch away the pigment.</span></p>
<h2><b>Addressing SMP Regrets</b></h2>

<p><span>During SMP operations, dyes are injected into several layers beneath the skin. They do not go as deep as traditional tattooing methods. Unqualified technicians can perform erroneous applications that go too deep, resulting in ink migration. This may also cause the ink's hue to change.</span></p>
<h3><b>Fixing SMP Mistakes</b></h3>

<p><span>SMP repair sessions are also required if the initial treatment was conducted incorrectly or by an untrained practitioner. Here are several general factors that need SMP repair: Poor technique or an inexperienced practitioner The ability and expertise of the SMP practitioner are important.</span></p>
<h3><b>SMP Removal Options</b></h3>
<div><img alt="SMP Removal Options" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/SMP_Removal_Options_480x480.jpg?v=1723188413"/></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Laser Tattoo Removal</b><span>: Uses laser technology to break down pigment particles in the scalp. The immune system then eliminates the particles. Multiple sessions are usually required, depending on the depth and density of the pigment. SMP is a highly effective and widely used method of tattoo removal.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Saline Removal</b><span>: A saline solution is injected into the affected area to remove the pigment from the skin. Multiple treatments are required, just like for laser removal. It is less painful than laser removal and may be beneficial for specific types of pigment.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Dermabrasion</b><span>: A surgical procedure that involves sanding down the skin's top layers to remove pigment. It usually only takes one or a few sessions. Rapidly removes large areas of pigmentation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Chemical Removal</b><span>: Chemical solutions are used to dissolve the pigment. It takes more than one session. Dermabrasion is a more invasive procedure.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Microneedling with Pigment Fading Solutions</b><span>: Similar to the SMP process, but with solutions that fade the pigment. Multiple sessions are required. Less invasive, and the pigment can fade over time.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Natural Fading</b><span>: Allowing the pigment to fade naturally with time. There is no expense or pain involved.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>SMP Touch-ups and Maintenance</b></h3>

<p><b>SMP Touch-Ups</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>It is often necessary 1-3 months after the initial operation to fine-tune the results and ensure uniform pigmentation. Typically every 2-5 years, depending on skin type, lifestyle, and environmental exposure.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The pigment has noticeably lightened, making the treatment appear less distinct. Areas in which the pigment has faded more than others, resulting in an uneven appearance. If you want a denser look or to cover up thinning spots.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Typically shorter than the first session, it concentrates on specific areas that require improvement.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>SMP Maintenance: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Apply a high-SPF <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-sunprotect-sunscreen-spf-50">sunscreen</a> to your scalp to protect the pigment from UV damage, which can cause fading. When spending long periods in the sun, wearing a hat can provide additional protection.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Keep the scalp hydrated to promote healthy skin and extend the life of the pigment. Use gentle, sulfate-free <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/shampoos">shampoos</a> and avoid alcohol-containing products, which can dry out the scalp and impair color.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Excessive perspiration, particularly shortly after the surgery, can cause the color to fade faster. Try to avoid excessive perspiration for at least a week after therapy.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Consult with your SMP artist regularly to check the treatment's progress and schedule touch-ups as needed.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>A balanced diet and lifestyle can improve skin health, which can help preserve the appearance of your SMP. Smoking can harm skin health and cause pigment to fade faster.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
