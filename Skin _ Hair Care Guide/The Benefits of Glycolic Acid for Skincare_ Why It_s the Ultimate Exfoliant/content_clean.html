<p><span>Glycolic acid, a common component in skin care products, is regarded as the best exfoliator for a variety of reasons. Some advantages of glycolic acid for skin care include effective exfoliation, skin renewal, improved skin texture and tone, improved product absorption, a brightening effect, and collagen stimulation. To prevent any skin sensitivity or irritation when using glycolic acid, it's necessary to start with a lower concentration and raise it gradually. When using glycolic acid as part of your skincare regimen, it's also important to use sunscreen every day because it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is Glycolic Acid?</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="Glycolic Acid " src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Home_remedies_for_dry_dull_skin_1_45ea9d9e-777f-4f87-8786-5960aded9b8b_480x480.png?v=1685092122"/></b></p>
<p><span>A form of <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/aha-bha-range">alpha hydroxy acid (AHA)</a> generated from sugar cane is glycolic acid. It can easily permeate the skin because it is a tiny molecule with great water solubility. The exfoliating and rejuvenating effects of glycolic acid make it a common ingredient in cosmetic products. Glycolic acid promotes gentle and efficient exfoliation by reducing the bonds that hold together dead skin cells. By dissolving the intercellular glue holding dead skin cells together, it functions as a chemical exfoliator. By removing the top layer of dull, dead skin cells, a smoother, more radiant complexion may be seen underneath. In addition to its exfoliating abilities, glycolic acid has other advantages for the skin. It increases collagen synthesis, which enhances skin suppleness and lessens the visibility of <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/fine-line-and-wrinkles">fine lines and wrinkles</a>. Encouraging the creation of fresh, healthier skin cells and the removal of old, unhealthy skin cells, can also aid in the fading of dark spots, hyperpigmentation, and acne scars. Glycolic acid can balance out skin tone, enhance skin texture, and minimize the appearance of enlarged pores.</span></p>
<p><span>It's important to know that different skincare products may include different amounts of glycolic acid. At-home use is acceptable for lower concentrations, which are commonly found in over-the-counter products. A skincare expert should give higher quantities, such as those used in professional chemical peels. If you're new to using glycolic acid, as with any active component, it's advised to patch test and begin with lower dosages. Continually monitor your skin's tolerance level as you gradually increase frequency and concentration. Additionally, glycolic acid might enhance UV sensitivity; therefore, it's crucial to use sunscreen every day when using it.</span></p>
<h3><b>How Does Glycolic Acid Exfoliate the Skin?</b></h3>
<p><span>Through its distinct chemical characteristics and modes of action, glycolic acid exfoliates the skin. How glycolic acid exfoliates skin is as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Skin penetration</b><span>: Due to its small molecular size, glycolic acid is able to penetrate the skin with ease. It has access to the stratum corneum, the top layer of skin where dead skin cells gather. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Intercellular adhesion disruption</b><span>: Glycolic acid works by severing the bonds connecting dead skin cells after being applied to the skin. It targets the desmosomes, which are the connective tissues in the stratum corneum that hold the skin cells together. Glycolic acid breaks down these intercellular adhesions, which loosens the bonds between the dead skin cells.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Increased desquamation</b><span>: Glycolic acid has the ability to hasten the <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/glycolic-acid-for-clear-bright-and-smooth-skin">natural exfoliation</a> process known as desquamation by reducing the bonds between dead skin cells. This makes it easier for dead skin cells to separate from the skin's surface.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cellular turnover</b><span>: Glycolic acid encourages cellular turnover by promoting the growth of new, healthy skin cells as the dead skin cells are shed from the skin's surface. This procedure promotes skin renewal, giving the complexion a smoother, younger appearance.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Enhanced moisture retention</b><span>: Glycolic acid can also make the skin more adept at retaining moisture. It is beneficial to exfoliate the skin's top layer, which is frequently dry and brittle. Glycolic acid helps moisturizers and other skincare products penetrate the skin more easily and hydrate the skin more effectively by removing dead skin cells.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It's vital to remember that the efficacy and outcomes of glycolic acid exfoliation might change based on the product's concentration and formulation, as well as the features of each person's skin. It is best to begin with lower concentrations and progressively increase usage if the skin is not adversely affected. Also advised are patch testing and heeding product directions. Use broad-spectrum sunscreen every day and restrict your exposure to the sun if you use glycolic acid in your skincare regimen because it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Benefits of Glycolic Acid for Skin</b></h3>
<p><span>Glycolic acid has a number of advantageous effects because of its capacity to exfoliate and rejuvenate the skin. Some of the main benefits of applying glycolic acid to the skin include the following:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Exfoliation</b><span>: Glycolic acid, a powerful exfoliant, aids in removing dead skin cells from the skin's surface. It reveals smoother, brighter, and younger-looking skin by encouraging controlled, gentle exfoliation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skin Texture Improvement</b><span>: Using glycolic acid on a regular basis can help to smooth roughness, minimize the look of fine lines and wrinkles, and hide acne scars or other surface irregularities.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Increased Collagen Production</b><span>: It has been discovered that glycolic acid stimulates the synthesis of collagen in the skin. The protein collagen gives the skin its structural support and elasticity. The signs of aging can be lessened and the skin can become firmer and more supple with increased collagen production. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reduction of Hyperpigmentation</b><span>: Melasma, sunspots, and other forms of hyperpigmentation, such as dark spots, can be faded with the aid of glycolic acid. It functions by removing the top layers of the skin, which helps to lighten pigmentation irregularities and encourage a more even skin tone.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Improved Product Absorption</b><span>: Glycolic acid exfoliates the skin, helping to get rid of the accumulation of dead skin cells, dirt, and oils on the skin's surface. This improves other skincare products' absorption, enabling them to penetrate the skin more effectively and benefit the deeper layers of the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Radiant and Youthful Complexion</b><span>: Glycolic acid's exfoliating and rejuvenating properties can give skin a more radiant and youthful appearance. It supports an appearance that is more youthful and restores a healthy glow.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Glycolic acid can make skin sensitive, especially when taken at higher concentrations or by people with sensitive skin. It is best to begin with lower concentrations and progressively increase usage if the skin is not adversely affected. Additionally, glycolic acid might make the skin more sensitive to the sun, so it's important to use sunscreen every day when taking it. As with any element in skincare, it is advised to seek the advice of a dermatologist or other skin care specialist to establish how glycolic acid should be used for your individual skin needs and concerns.</span></p>

<h2><b>Glycolic Acid vs. Other Alpha Hydroxy Acids: What's the Difference?</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="Glycolic Acid " src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Introduction_1_98e9b283-b310-4211-a588-7f0aea647ab8_480x480.png?v=1685094967"/></b></p>
<p><span>Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), are all used in skin care products, and each has unique properties and advantages, including glycolic acid. The following table contrasts glycolic acid with other popular AHAs:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Glycolic Acid</b><span>: Glycolic acid is derived from sugar cane and has the smallest molecular size of any AHA. It can easily and deeply penetrate the skin due to its small size. It has a reputation for having great exfoliating qualities that encourage the removal of dead skin cells and increase cell turnover. In order to improve skin texture, minimize the look of fine lines and wrinkles, and treat hyperpigmentation, glycolic acid is frequently used.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Lactic Acid</b><span>: Lactic acid, which is derived from milk, has slightly bigger molecules than glycolic acid. It is also a good exfoliant, but it is gentler and more hydrating than glycolic acid. Lactic acid is beneficial for those with dry or sensitive skin because it exfoliates while maintaining skin moisture levels. It has the ability to improve skin texture, brighten the complexion, and increase hydration.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Mandelic Acid</b><span>: Compared to glycolic and lactic acids, mandelic acid has a larger molecular size and is derived from bitter almonds. Sensitive skin can use it because of its gentle exfoliating qualities. <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/mandelic-acid-for-darker-skin-tones-benefits-and-usage-tips">Mandelic acid</a> also has antibacterial qualities, which can be beneficial for people with skin that is prone to acne. It can smooth out skin tone, enhance skin texture, and lessen the visibility of acne scars. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Citric Acid</b><span>: Citrus fruits are the source of this acid, which is larger in molecules than glycolic, lactic, and mandelic acids. It is a milder exfoliant and is frequently used in skin care products in lower concentrations. Citric acid is an antioxidant that can help to promote a more even skin tone, improve skin texture, and brighten the complexion.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Although all AHAs have exfoliating abilities, the main variations are in their molecular sizes, potencies, and particular advantages. Individual skin issues, sensitivity levels, and intended results all play a role in determining which AHA to use. It's important to keep in mind that AHAs might make skin more sensitive to the sun, therefore, it's imperative to use sunscreen every day when using them in your skincare regimen. To choose the best AHA for your skin type, issues, and tolerance, it is essential to speak with a physician or skincare expert. They may offer you individualized advice and direction on how to safely and efficiently include AHAs into your beauty routine.</span></p>
<h3><b>Lactic Acid vs. Glycolic Acid</b></h3>
<p><span>Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), which are frequently used in skincare, include glycolic acid and lactic acid. They differ from one another, even though they have some things in common. The comparison of lactic acid and glycolic acid is as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Molecular Size</b><span>: Glycolic acid has a smaller molecular size than lactic acid. Glycolic acid can reach the lower layers of the epidermis thanks to its smaller size, which also allows for deeper skin penetration. Lactic acid has a larger molecular size than glycolic acid, so it does not penetrate the skin as deeply.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Exfoliant Properties</b><span>: Lactic acid and glycolic acid are both effective exfoliants. They work by releasing the bonds that hold dead skin cells together, allowing them to shed and revealing a smoother, brighter complexion. However, because of its smaller molecular size, glycolic acid is often thought to be a more effective exfoliant than lactic acid.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sensitivity</b><span>: When compared to glycolic acid, lactic acid is generally thought to be kinder to the skin. It has a slower rate of penetration and less potential for irritation due to its larger molecular size. For people with sensitive skin or those who are new to using AHAs, lactic acid is frequently advised.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydration</b><span>: Lactic acid hydrates the skin. It is a good option for people with dry or dehydrated skin because it helps to draw in and hold moisture. On the other hand, glycolic acid, especially at higher concentrations, may have a slight drying effect. After using glycolic acid, it's crucial to apply moisturizers to keep the skin hydrated.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Benefits for the Skin</b><span>: Both lactic acid and glycolic acid have advantages for the skin, such as enhancing skin texture, minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and promoting a more radiant appearance. However, because of its smaller molecular size and potential for deeper penetration, glycolic acid is frequently preferred for its potential to produce more noticeable results. </span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>When choosing between lactic acid and glycolic acid, it's important to take your skin type, degree of sensitivity and desired results into consideration. If you have sensitive skin or are not familiar with AHAs, you might want to start with lactic acid. Glycolic acid might be appropriate if you need a more powerful exfoliation and have less sensitive skin. When adding AHAs to your skincare regimen, it's wise to patch test first and start with lower doses. A dermatologist or other skincare expert can help you choose the right AHA for your unique needs and advise you on how to use it safely and efficiently in your skincare routine.</span></p>
<h3><b>Mandelic Acid vs. Glycolic Acid</b></h3>
<p><span>Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) like glycolic acid and malonic acid are both applied to the skin, although their characteristics and advantages vary. Mandelic acid and glycolic acid are contrasted here:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Mandelic acid's molecules are larger than glycolic acid's, in terms of size. It penetrates the skin more slowly and shallowly than glycolic acid due to its larger size. Because of this, mandelic acid is frequently regarded as a kinder and gentler exfoliation option.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Mandelic acid and glycolic acid both have exfoliating properties that aid in removing dead skin cells and encouraging skin renewal. In contrast to glycolic acid, mandelic acid offers a more mild exfoliation because of its larger molecular size. It is suitable for people with sensitive skin or those who might itch from other AHAs.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Mandelic acid has antibacterial properties, which is one of its special advantages. It is a good option for people with acne-prone skin because it can help control the growth of bacteria that cause acne on the skin. The antibacterial properties of glycolic acid are different.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Mandelic acid and glycolic acid both work to lessen the appearance of hyperpigmentation, including melasma and dark spots. However, people with darker skin tones or those who are prone to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation frequently prefer mandelic acid. It is thought to be less likely than glycolic acid to result in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>People with sensitive skin typically tolerate mandelic acid well because of how mild it is.  It is less likely to irritate the skin or cause it to become red when compared to glycolic acid. However, sensitivity differs from person to person, so conduct a patch test and start with lesser concentrations when adding any new product to your skincare routine.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Mandelic acid and glycolic acid both have side effects that can make skin more sensitive to the sun, so it's important to use sunscreen every day when using these AHAs. However, compared to glycolic acid, mandelic acid generally has a lower risk of causing photosensitivity.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Think about your skin type, sensitivity level, and specific concerns when deciding between glycolic acid and mandelic acid. If you have sensitive skin or are prone to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, mandelic acid might be a better option. Glycolic acid may be a better choice if you want greater exfoliation or have less sensitive skin. To find the ideal AHA for your skin and get individualized guidance on how to incorporate it successfully and safely into your skincare routine, it is always advised to speak with a dermatologist or skincare expert.</span></p>
<h3><b>Which One Is Best for Your Skin Type?</b></h3>

<h3><b>Tips for Using Glycolic Acid on Sensitive Skin</b></h3>
<p><span>To reduce the risk of irritation, special care and precautions must be taken while using glycolic acid on sensitive skin. If you have sensitive skin, use the following advice to incorporate glycolic acid into your skincare regimen:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Begin with a low concentration of glycolic acid, such as 5% or less. This allows your skin to gradually adjust to the acid, lowering the risk of sensitivity or irritation. If your skin tolerates it well, you can gradually increase the concentration over time.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Before using glycolic acid on your entire face, perform a patch test on a small area of the skin. Apply a small amount of the product to the inner arm or behind the ear and wait 24 to 48 hours to see if there are any adverse reactions or irritation. If you have a lot of redness, itching, or discomfort, it could be because your skin is allergic to glycolic acid.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid usage should be moderate; avoid using it frequently, especially at first. Start with once or twice a week and track the results on your skin. If your skin becomes irritated, reduce the frequency or concentration of glycolic acid or temporarily discontinue use. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Consider using glycolic acid as a treatment with a short contact time. Apply it to your skin and leave it on for a short period of time, such as 5-10 minutes, before rinsing it off with water. This can help reduce the possibility of irritation while still reaping the benefits of exfoliation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Apply a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer immediately after using glycolic acid. Moisturizing replenishes hydration and soothes the skin, lowering the risk of dryness or irritation. Look for moisturizers designed especially for sensitive skin.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid shouldn't be combined with other exfoliants like physical scrubbing or other chemical exfoliants. The danger of over-exfoliation and increased sensitivity can increase when using various exfoliants at once.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Pay attention to how glycolic acid affects your skin. Reduce the frequency or concentration of glycolic acid or temporarily stop using it if you suffer extreme redness, irritation, burning, or discomfort. Everybody has different skin, therefore it's crucial to modify your regimen to meet your skin's individual demands.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>It's always a good idea to speak with a dermatologist if you have any worries about using glycolic acid on your delicate skin or if you're unclear about the best course of action. They can assess your skin, offer you individualized advice, and help you safely incorporate glycolic acid into your skincare regimen.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>When using glycolic acid, keep in mind to wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher because it can make the skin more sensitive to the sun. To keep your skin healthy and resilient, you must protect it from UV radiation.</span></p>
<h2><b>Glycolic Acid and Acne: Can It Help Clear Your Skin?</b></h2>
<p><span>Yes, glycolic acid can be helpful in clearing up acne-prone skin. Here are some ways glycolic acid can help with acne:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid is a chemical exfoliant that aids in the removal of dead skin cells from the skin's surface. Exfoliating the skin aids in the unclogging of pores and the prevention of the formation of acne-causing bacteria, which can lead to breakouts.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid has the ability to penetrate the skin deeply and reach the pores. It aids in the dissolution of excess sebum (oil) and other impurities that can clog pores and contribute to acne formation. Glycolic acid can help prevent new breakouts by keeping the pores clear.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid encourages cell turnover and stimulates the production of collagen, which results in a smoother and more even skin texture. The appearance of acne scars and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation can both be diminished by doing this.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Product absorption is improved because glycolic acid removes the top layer of dead skin cells, allowing other skincare products, such as acne treatments or moisturizers, to penetrate deeper into the skin and be more effective. </span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>When using glycolic acid to treat acne, keep the following things in mind:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Start with a lower amount of glycolic acid (5% or less) and then progressively increase it as long as your skin accepts it. Because of this, the likelihood of irritation is reduced, especially if you have sensitive skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Perform a patch test on a small portion of your face before using glycolic acid all over to check for any negative reactions or sensitivities.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid should be used regularly as part of your skincare regimen for best results. If your skin accepts it well, begin by using it a few times per week and then gradually increase the frequency.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Maintain the skin's hydration and barrier function by using a moisturizer after using glycolic acid because this ingredient can be drying.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, so shield it from the sun. In order to avoid sun damage and safeguard your skin from additional acne-related problems, it's essential to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher when using glycolic acid.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Although many people with skin prone to acne can benefit from glycolic acid, specific outcomes may differ. It is advised to see a dermatologist if your acne is severe or persistent, so they can examine your skin and suggest the best course of action for you.</span></p>
<h3><b>How Does Glycolic Acid Help Treat Acne?</b></h3>
<p><span>Through its exfoliating and anti-inflammatory qualities, glycolic acid aids in the treatment of acne. The following describes how glycolic acid treats acne:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) such as glycolic acid can exfoliate the skin because of their small molecular size, which enables them to do so. It functions by loosening the bonds holding together dead skin cells on the skin's surface, encouraging their shedding. This exfoliating action aids in pore cleaning, preventing the accumulation of dirt, oil, and dead skin cells that can lead to acne.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid aids in <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/demelan-cream">pore unclogging</a> by exfoliating the skin and removing built-up debris. It has the ability to dissolve extra sebum (oil), which when combined with dead skin cells, can block pores. By keeping the pores clear, glycolic acid helps to prevent the formation of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads), which are precursors to acne lesions.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Anti-inflammatory properties: Acne is frequently associated with skin inflammation. Glycolic acid has mild anti-inflammatory properties that can aid in the reduction of redness, swelling, and overall inflammation associated with acne lesions. Glycolic acid can aid in enhancing the appearance of active breakouts by calming the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Acne lesions may occasionally leave behind dark spots or discoloration known as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) after they have healed. By encouraging cellular turnover and skin renewal and resulting in a more even skin tone, glycolic acid can aid in the fading of these marks.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Glycolic acid improves the penetration and effectiveness of other acne-fighting ingredients by exfoliating the skin and removing the outer layer of dead skin cells. It makes it easier for acne treatments like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to penetrate the skin's surface and more effectively treat the affected areas.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Use glycolic acid as instructed while treating acne, introducing it gradually into your skincare routine to give your skin time to adjust. Additionally, it's critical to wear a moisturizer and sunscreen after using glycolic acid because it might make skin more sensitive to the sun and cause dryness or irritation. A dermatologist can offer personalized advice and recommendations based on your unique skin needs if you suffer from severe or persistent acne.</span></p>
<h3><b>Combining Glycolic Acid with Other Acne-Fighting Ingredients</b></h3>
<p><span>Glycolic acid can be used effectively in combination with other acne-fighting substances to treat acne and enhance the general health of your skin. The following substances can be used in conjunction with glycolic acid to help treat acne:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Salicylic Acid</b><span>: Salicylic acid, a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA), aids in pore cleaning and skin exfoliation. It complements glycolic acid well and targets both superficial and deeper impurities that contribute to acne. Salicylic acid can become more effective by helping to increase its penetration with glycolic acid.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Benzoyl peroxide</b><span>: This antibacterial substance aids in the elimination of bacteria that contribute to acne on the skin's surface. It can provide a dual-action approach by exfoliating the skin and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/is-benzoyl-peroxide-good-for-acne">inhibiting bacterial growth</a> when used in conjunction with glycolic acid. It's important to start with a lower concentration and gradually increase it if tolerated because benzoyl peroxide may cause dryness and irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Retinoids</b><span>: Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that can aid in clearing clogged pores, reducing inflammation, and promoting cell turnover. Examples include retinol and prescription-strength tretinoin. A synergistic effect from combining glycolic acid and retinoids can lead to skin that is smoother and clearer. However, retinoids must be introduced gradually to avoid excessive dryness and irritation.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Tea Tree Oil</b><span>: Tea tree oil contains antimicrobial properties that can aid in the fight against acne-causing bacteria. When combined with glycolic acid, it can provide a natural and gentle solution to acne. However, be careful when using tea tree oil because it can irritate the skin in high concentrations.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Niacinamide</b><span>: Niacinamide, a type of vitamin B3, has the ability to control sebum production, lessen inflammation, and enhance skin barrier performance. When used alongside glycolic acid, it can help <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-nia-serum">minimize acne breakouts</a> and promote overall skin health.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hyaluronic Acid</b><span>: A moisturizing substance that can provide skin moisture is <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/hyaluronic-acid-serum-for-face">hyaluronic acid</a>. While keeping the face hydrated, it can help combat the possible drying effects of glycolic acid. After using glycolic acid, it may be advantageous to use a moisturizer or serum containing hyaluronic acid.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Always start cautiously and patch-test new products to see how your skin reacts when combining these substances. Always seek the opinion of a dermatologist for specific recommendations if you have sensitive skin or are unsure about the proper concentrations.</span></p>
