<h3><b>Preparing for Microdermabrasion</b></h3>
<p><span>Preparing for Microdermabrasion starts outside the office. It involves the following:</span></p>
<h4><strong>#1 Understanding your skin needs and type:</strong></h4>
<p><span>If your skin shows signs of ageing such as wrinkles and dark spots, and scars, and you want to minimise it; or if you want to improve the appearance of skin and get rid of dullness, Microdermabrasion can be used to achieve the desired results. However, your skin may not support microdermabrasion if you have various skin conditions like</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Eczema</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Rosacea</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Active </span><span>Acne</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Dermatitis</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Psoriasis</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Warts</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Lupus</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Uncontrolled Diabetes</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Compromised </span><span>Skin Barrier</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h4><strong>#2 Understanding the Financial Factor:</strong></h4>
<p><span>Understand that certain dermatological procedures bear high costs. We, at </span><span>Clinikally</span><span> also provide the mentioned treatment. </span><span>Book an appointment</span><span> with our </span><span>top dermatologists</span><span> to know more.</span><span><br/></span></p>
<h4><strong>#3 Providing a Comprehensive Medical History to the Doctor:</strong></h4>
<p><span>Inform your doctor about all the medicines you are taking/using or have taken/used at any point in the past. Mention about any skin problem that you are going through.</span><span><br/></span></p>
<h4><strong>#4 Following all Instructions Given to You by the Dermatologist:</strong></h4>
<p><span>Doctors may ask you to indulge in special skin care practices so as to prepare your skin for the actual treatment. These products are usually available at the clinic or on prescription from pharmacies. Make sure to follow the instructions.</span><span><br/></span></p>
<h4><strong>#5 Avoiding Salon Treatments:</strong></h4>
<p><span>Avoid indulging in beauty routines at the salon such as threading, waxing, facials etc. It is to be avoided as these may result in an increased sensitivity and dryness, that may lead to further complications.</span></p>
<h4><strong>#6 Avoiding Other Skin Treatments:</strong></h4>
<p><span>Receiving a BOTOX injection or doing chemical peels is contraindicated as it compromises the skin barrier, that may lead to complications during and after the procedure of microdermabrasion. </span></p>
<h4><strong>#7 Minimising Sun Exposure:</strong></h4>
<p><span>Exposure to harsh sun rays causes damage to the sun and an increased sensitivity. Hence, avoid going out in the sun at least a week prior to the scheduled appointment.</span></p>
<h4><strong>#8 Discontinuing Other Topical Actives:</strong></h4>
<p><span>Discontinue using various topical active medications to decrease the skin sensitivity. Avoid using the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Retinoids</span></li>
<li><span>Salicylic Acid Products</span></li>
<li><span>Benzoyl Peroxide</span></li>
<li><span>Alpha Hydroxy Acids</span></li>
<li><span>Beta Hydroxy Acids</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>#9 Discontinuing taking NSAIDs and Minimise Smoking:</strong></h4>
<p><span>Consult a doctor and stop taking Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) as these increase the risk of bleeding and facial rashes. Common NSAIDs include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Aspirin</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Ibuprofen</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Mefenamic Acid</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Diclofenac</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Naproxen</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Ketorolac</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Aceclofenac</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Celecoxib</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Oxaprozin</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Piroxicam</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Etoricoxib etc.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Also, minimise smoking at least a week prior to your appointment, as it inhibits blood circulation in the skin. To achieve a long term result of your treatment, minimise smoking. </span></p>
<h4><strong>#10 Cleaning Face Before the Appointment:</strong></h4>
<p><span>On the day of your appointment, clean the face using a mild, oil free, hydrating cleanser. Also, avoid applying makeup on the scheduled appointment. </span></p>
<p><span>Take a note to reschedule your appointment, if any blister, boil or active acne develops.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Science of Skin Rejuvenation: How Microdermabrasion Works</b></h3>
<p><span>Microdermabrasion is an exfoliation process that involves the following steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Cleaning-</strong> It involves using a<a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-foaming-face-wash"> deep cleansing gel </a>or foam to remove dust, makeup, or natural oils from the skin.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Toning-</strong> A toner is further used to remove any remaining impurities.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Exfoliating-</strong> A special diamond-coated tipped wand is used to thoroughly exfoliate the skin.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Hydrating-</strong> After removing the dead skin cells from the top most layer of the skin, a face mask and serum are used to hydrate and nourish the skin.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Moisturising-</strong> A </span><span>moisturiser</span><span> is used to deeply moisturise and nourish the skin.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Applying Sunscreen-</strong> As the exposed underneath skin layer is weak and extremely soft, using a good sunscreen is an absolute necessity as it protects the fragile skin from any sun damage.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h3><b>Microdermabrasion vs. Chemical Peels: Understanding the Differences</b></h3>
<p><span>Though both these aid in exfoliating, the major difference between these is that microdermabrasion is a physical process and chemical peeling, as the name suggests, is a chemical process. The difference between them is outlined in the table below:</span></p>

<h3><b>Achieving a Youthful Glow: The Visible Benefits of Microdermabrasion</b></h3>
<p><span>Microdermabrasion, a non-invasive skin care technique, offers a spectrum of visible benefits for various skin concerns. It employs fine crystals or a diamond tip to gently exfoliate the skin's surface, removing dead skin cells and promoting a brighter, clearer complexion. This process stimulates blood flow and collagen production, contributing to a more youthful and radiant skin appearance. </span></p>
<p><span>It's particularly effective in reducing the visibility of fine lines, wrinkles, and acne scars, making the skin appear smoother and more even-toned. Regular treatments can also help in minimising enlarged pores and controlling acne breakouts. Microdermabrasion's ability to enhance product absorption further boosts its efficacy, allowing skincare products to penetrate deeper and work more effectively. Suitable for most skin types, it's a favoured choice for those seeking a non-surgical way to rejuvenate and revitalise their skin.</span></p>
<h3><b>Other Benefits Of Microdermabrasion</b></h3>
<p><span>Apart from enhancing the appearance, microdermabrasion is very beneficial as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>it is safe and effective for all skin types. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>exfoliating crystals are extremely fine, hence any damage to the skin is avoided.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>no incisions or anaesthesia is required.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>no risk for scarring or infection.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>painless treatment</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>less on chai time. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>immediate results</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>long lasting results (for months) </span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Beyond Beauty: Health Benefits of Regular Microdermabrasion</b></h3>
<p><span>Regular microdermabrasion sessions offer several benefits such as:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Stimulates collagen production in the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Unclogs the pores thereby lessening acne breakouts.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Increases the efficacy of skincare products by enhancing their penetration.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Increases the delivery of certain transdermal medicines like insulin, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-vitamin-c3-serum">vitamin C </a>etc.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Inculcates confidence due to improved skin aesthetic.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>The Role of Microdermabrasion in Anti-Aging Regimens</b></h3>
<p><span>Due to diminished formation of various proteins like Keratin, Collagen and Elastin, the skin, as we age, loses its firmness and elasticity. As a result, skin starts to sag, along with development and formation of fine lines and wrinkles.</span></p>
<p><span>Microdermabrasion comes to the rescue as it aids in skin exfoliation and increases the turnover of the cells of the top layer of skin. Collagen production is also enhanced significantly. This results in revealing a bright and radiant complexion, with minimised appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Age spots and melasma also get reduced as microdermabrasion rearranges the pigment causing cells in the skin. Microdermabrasion paves the way for better absorption of other anti ageing products leading to a synergistic action of microdermabrasion and </span><span>anti ageing</span><span> regimen products.</span></p>
<h2><b>Professional Insights into Microdermabrasion<br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="Professional Insights into Microdermabrasion" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_4_96_480x480.jpg?v=1705561760"/></div>
<p><span>Microdermabrasion, as viewed by professionals, is a great skin treatment because it effectively enhances the health and appearance of skin. It is a non-invasive procedure, known for its safety and minimal downtime, which uses a mechanical medium to exfoliate the surface of the skin gently. It drastically improves skin texture, reduces signs of ageing like fine lines and sun damage, and aids in acne management. Regular treatments can lead to significant improvements in skin tone and texture, making it a popular choice for those seeking a refreshed and rejuvenated complexion. It's often a part of a holistic skincare regime, combined with other treatments for optimal results. It minimises the need to get fillers and botox drastically. It indeed is a safer alternative for it.</span></p>
<h3><b>Choosing Between Professional and At-Home Microdermabrasion</b></h3>
<p><span>While we strongly advocate going to a dermatological clinic for any skin treatment, Microdermabrasion is one such treatment that can be done at home. Various at-home microdermabrasion kits are trending in the market.</span></p>
<p><span>At-home microdermabrasion kits offer a convenient and cost-effective alternative to professional treatments. These kits typically include a handheld device with an exfoliating tip, along with skincare products formulated for use with the treatment. Designed for ease of use, these kits allow individuals to perform the exfoliating procedure in the comfort of their own homes, providing a practical solution for maintaining skin health and radiance. However, it's crucial to follow instructions carefully and understand that at-home kits may not be as powerful as professional treatments, but they can still effectively support a regular skincare routine.</span></p>
<h3><b>Post-Treatment Care: Maximising the Benefits of Microdermabrasion</b></h3>
<p><span>The risks associated with microdermabrasion, while typically mild, include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Short-Term Discomfort:</strong> Common immediate aftereffects like redness and swelling are temporary and usually resolve within a few hours.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Skin Dryness and Flaking:</strong> It's normal for the skin to experience dryness and flakiness for several days post-treatment as it heals and regenerates.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Bruising:</strong> The suction technique used in microdermabrasion can lead to bruising, which might last for a few days.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Sun Sensitivity:</strong> Post-treatment, the skin becomes more vulnerable to sun damage. Hence, it's crucial to apply sunscreen diligently, particularly right after a session, to protect the newly exposed skin layers. </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-sunprotect-sunscreen-spf-50"><span>Clinikally SunProtect Sunscreen SPF 50/PA+++</span></a><span> is highly recommended.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>These risks highlight the importance of proper aftercare following a microdermabrasion treatment to ensure safe and effective healing.</span></p>
<h3>
<span> </span><b>The After-Care<br/></b><span><br/></span><span>To maintain the benefits of microdermabrasion treatment, follow these essential aftercare tips:</span>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Stay Cool and Calm:</strong> For the first 24 hours, strictly avoid those activities that raise body temperature like hot showers and strenuous exercise. Keep your skin cool with dermatologist recommended creams.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Gentle Skincare Routine:</strong> Use the hydrating and gentle products advised by your dermatologist, such as specific cleansers, moisturisers, and serums.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Hydration is Key:</strong> Drink plenty of water. Also, use a moisturising spray throughout the day to maintain your skin's hydration.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Avoid Picking:</strong> Post-treatment peeling is normal; resist picking or peeling at your skin for optimal healing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Your new skin is sun-sensitive hence, appling a high SPF sunscreen every four hours, especially when outdoors is a necessity.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>

<br/>
<h3><b>Comparing Home Kits: Selecting the Right Tools for Microdermabrasion</b></h3>
<p><span>At-home microdermabrasion kits are available in two innovative types:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Crystal-Based:</strong> These are the classic systems that utilise a crystal tip or a cream with fine crystals, like aluminium oxide, for skin exfoliation. The crystal cream is massaged into the skin, peeling away the surface layer, much like a scrub.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Diamond-Tipped:</strong> It is a more recent development in this field, these kits use a diamond-encrusted tip to polish and exfoliate the skin. It offers enhanced control and consistent results, and are user-friendly and economical as they don't require frequent cream refills.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Each type mimics professional treatments, offering a spa-like experience at home. However, care is to be taken to not do it aggressively. Also, results achieved are not at par with the result of the treatment offered by a dermatologist. Consistent input is required at home, to achieve the results comparable to the ones at the clinic.</span></p>
<p><span>Before choosing the device of your choice for in home microdermabrasion, consider the following points:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Budget</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Preferred suction power</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Desired comfort level</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Number of tips or heads included </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Ease of use</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Portability</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Integrating Microdermabrasion into Your Regular Skincare Routine</b></h3>
<p><span>Microdermabrasion is a great practice that can be incorporated into your skin care regimen as it offers improved texture and appearance of skin, along with its anti-ageing effect. Regular discipline and consistency is the key. It is best to consult a dermatologist as only a dermatologist can accurately inform you about the frequency of derma clinic visits required to treat your concern and can adequately schedule the visits.</span></p>
<p><span>However, if you are doing it at home, generally it is recommended to perform it every 6-8 weeks, up to three sessions, with a break before restarting. Also, closely follow the manual and the instructions of the device for the best results.</span></p>
<h2><b>Personalised Skincare Strategies Post-Microdermabrasion<br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="Personalised Skincare Strategies Post-Microdermabrasion" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_4_97_480x480.jpg?v=1705562530"/></div>
<p><span>Microdermabrasion treatment is a non-invasive, gentle procedure, but it may result in some temporary side effects such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Redness or a pink hue to the face</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Feeling of skin tightness and burning</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Sensitivity</span></p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Immediate Care:</strong> Cleanse your face gently with a wet cloth and a rehydrating toner to remove residual dead skin cells.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Moisturising:</strong> Apply a rich and a heavy </span><span>moisturiser</span><span>. Use it for 4-6 days to avoid excessive peeling. </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hydrasoothe-moisturiser"><span>Clinikally HydraSoothe Moisturiser</span></a><span> is your best bet.</span><span><br/></span></p>
