Iodine is an often-overlooked factor in the quest for attractive hair. Yes, iodine, an essential element primarily connected with thyroid health, plays an important part in preserving the vibrancy and shine of your hair. In this blog, we'll look into Iodine's uses and benefits for overall hair health.
The Role of Iodine in the Body
Iodine is a trace element that naturally occurs in your body and plays a crucial part in normal operation. Iodine is required for optimal cellular activity; your cells use iodine to convert food into energy, and your thyroid requires a steady supply of iodine for proper operation. Iodine can be obtained from pharmaceuticals, but it can also be obtained from iodine-rich foods, which can help you achieve your daily iodine requirements. Some dairy products, iodized salt, and certain fish (think cod, sea bass, haddock, and perch), as well as kelp and land-dwelling plants produced in iodine-rich soil, can provide you with the iodine you need each day. The Food and Nutrition Board states that individuals can have roughly 150 micrograms per day, while nursing or pregnant women can consume up to 290 micrograms safely. Numerous trace elements in your body are essential for normal function; selenium is one that you will frequently hear about. In tiny doses, it is essential for good function. A trace element shortage has repercussions.
What is Iodine?
Iodine is a mineral found in certain diets. The body requires iodine to produce thyroid hormones. These hormones regulate the body's metabolism and other vital activities. The body also requires thyroid hormones for optimal bone and brain development during pregnancy and infancy. Everyone needs iodine, especially newborns and pregnant women.
Importance of Iodine for Thyroid Health
Iodine's primary duty is to maintain optimal thyroid function. It contributes to the regulation of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Getting enough iodine is essential for avoiding low thyroid hormone levels and hypothyroidism.
How Iodine Affects Overall Health
Scientists are investigating iodine to learn how it affects health. Here are some examples of what this research revealed.
Fetal and infant development
: Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding require adequate iodine intake for their babies' normal growth and development. Breastfed babies absorb iodine from breast milk. However, breast milk's iodine content is determined by the mother's iodine intake. To ensure adequate iodine levels for normal fetal and infant development, various national and international organizations recommend that pregnant and breastfeeding women, as well as newborns, take iodine supplements. The American Thyroid Association recommends that pregnant, trying to conceive, or breastfeeding women take a daily supplement containing 150 mcg of iodine in the form of potassium iodide. The American Academy of Pediatrics offers similar guidelines. Only about half of the prenatal multivitamins available in the United States contain iodine.
Cognitive function during childhood
: A severe iodine shortage in childhood impairs brain and nervous system development. The effects of a modest iodine shortage in youth are more difficult to assess, yet they may create minor difficulties with neurological development. Giving iodine supplements to youngsters with modest iodine shortages boosts their reasoning skills and overall cognitive performance. Iodine supplements appear to benefit both physical and mental development in children from iodine-deficient areas. More research is needed to completely understand the impact of mild iodine shortages and iodine supplementation on cognitive function.
Fibrocystic breast disease
: Although not hazardous, fibrocystic breast disease results in lumpy, uncomfortable breasts. It primarily affects women of reproductive age, but it can also develop during menopause. Very high doses of iodine supplements may alleviate the pain and other symptoms of fibrocystic breast disease, but further research is needed to prove this. Consult your doctor or
dermatologists
before taking iodine for this ailment, as large doses might be dangerous.
Radiation-induced thyroid cancer
: Nuclear accidents can emit radioactive iodine into the environment, raising the risk of thyroid cancer in those exposed to it, particularly youngsters. People with iodine shortage who are exposed to radioactive iodine are at an increased risk of acquiring thyroid cancer. The United States Food and Drug Administration has licensed potassium iodide as a thyroid-blocking medication to lower the risk of thyroid cancer during radiation crises.
Low iodine diets for radioactive iodine treatment
: Certain people with thyroid cancer are treated with radioactive iodine. Patients preparing for this treatment are usually advised to eat a low-iodine diet (50 mcg or less per day) for 1 to 2 weeks before beginning treatment.
Iodine and Hair Growth
When looking into the complex relationship between iodine and hair development, the focus shifts. Iodine is essential for thyroid hormone production, which regulates the hair growth cycle. Hair follicles are sensitive to these hormones, and abnormalities can cause disturbances in typical development patterns. Ensuring an adequate intake of iodine for thyroid hormone production appears to be a strategic approach, not just for overall health but also for promoting lush and healthy
hair growth

How Iodine Contributes to Hair Health
The link between iodine and
hair loss
is not due to iodine deficiency; instead, excessive iodine may have a tertiary association with hair loss.  What's the link between the two? Your thyroid gland. Hyperthyroidism is a disorder in which your thyroid overproduces thyroid hormones, creating a variety of complications.  In the most extreme cases of untreated thyroid dysfunction, the illness might eventually cause irreversible damage to the hair structure. So, where does iodine fit into this? Excessive iodine might be one of the leading causes of hyperthyroidism.  Excess iodine from food or pharmaceuticals is one of the most common causes of hyperthyroidism, second only to genetics, age, and gender.
Iodine Deficiency and Hair Loss
Hair loss may occur gradually in hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. You will not necessarily detect missing patches or
bald
places. Instead, your hair may appear thinner overall. Every day, you lose 50 to 100 hairs from your head. If regular hair development is disrupted, hairs are not regenerated, and uniform hair loss may result. The good news is that hair loss due to thyroid issues is usually transitory. Even if you start taking medications to treat your disease, you may lose your hair. Some people are concerned that the medications would cause hair loss, but this could be due to the hair's natural life cycle.
Scientific Studies on Iodine and Hair Growth
Iodine is a trace element required for proper cellular function and thyroid functioning. Iodine shortage can inhibit hair follicles from renewing, resulting in hair loss, thinning, and breakage over time. However, consuming enough iodine can help to reverse hair loss caused by an iodine deficit. Iodine can be found in a variety of foods, including dairy products, iodized salt, some seafood, kelp, and land-based plants growing in iodine-rich soil.
Sources and Supplements of Iodine
Seafood, eggs, milk, and milk products are excellent sources of iodine. People who eat these items infrequently or not at all may not obtain enough iodine. People who live in iodine-deficient soils and eat primarily local foods.
Iodine-Rich Foods
To maintain optimal hair growth, health, and strength, we must meet our daily iodine requirements through our diets. Many foods contain iodine, particularly seaweed, dairy, tuna, shrimp, and eggs.  Iodine is now found in common table salt, known as "iodized salt." Check out the following list for more iodine-rich foods:
Seaweed
Kombu Kelp (2000% DV)
Wakame (44% DV)
Nori (11-29% DV)
Cod (42-66% DV)
Dairy
Milk (59-112% DV)
Yogurt (50% DV)
Cottage Cheese
Cheddar Cheese
Iodized Salt
Shrimp (23% DV)
Tuna (11% DV)
Eggs (16% DV)
Lima Beans (10% DV)
Prunes (9% DV)
Out of all of these options, seaweed, in particular, depending on the type of seaweed, contains the most iodine.
Iodine Supplements: What to Know
Iodine supplements can help persons who are iodine deficient, pregnant or breastfeeding or suffer from certain thyroid problems. However, ingesting too much iodine might be dangerous, therefore follow recommended dosage guidelines:
Children's daily doses should not exceed 200 mcg for children aged 1-3, 300 mcg for children aged 4-8, 600 mcg for children aged 9-13, and 900 mcg for adolescents.
Adults should avoid taking more than 150 mcg per day.
Recommended Dosage for Hair Health
The average recommended iodine dose for most adults is 150 mcg daily. Iodine is most effectively absorbed on an empty stomach. It is best to take it half an hour before or two hours after meals to maximize absorption.
Practical Tips for Using Iodine for Hair Growth
Iodine can improve hair growth and strength while also aiding in the treatment of iodine deficiency-related hair loss. Here are a few ways to use iodine to stimulate hair growth:
Diluted iodine
: Mix 2-3 tablespoons of iodine with 1 tablespoon of water and apply it to your scalp with your fingers. Massage it in for 5-10 minutes, then rinse with lukewarm or cool water. After 15-20 minutes, apply the conditioner.
Table salt with iodine
: Wash and air dry your hair, then apply table salt containing iodine to the areas of your scalp where you are losing hair. Gently massage it in to achieve optimum absorption. If the salt hurts your scalp, dilute it with a few tablespoons of water before use. To achieve the best effects, repeat this practice daily.
Incorporating Iodine into Your Diet
Here are some iodine-rich foods to help you incorporate it into your diet:
Salt-containing iodine
: A pure form of iodine that is appropriate for all diets, especially vegetarians and vegans.
Eggs
: The yolk of a whole egg contains the majority of the iodine, as well as other nutrients like protein and healthy fats.
Seaweed is edible
: A naturally iodine-rich diet can help support a healthy thyroid.
Dairy Products
: Plain, low-fat, and Greek yogurts provide roughly half of your daily iodine needs.
Milk
: A cup of milk contains approximately 56 micrograms of iodine.
Cod
: A serving of cod can contain approximately 158 mcg of iodine.
Tuna
: A portion of tuna weighing 170 grams contains 34 mg of iodine.
Topical Iodine Treatments for Hair
Iodine Tincture
: A diluted iodine tincture can be applied to the scalp with a cotton ball. To avoid irritation, ensure that the concentration is not too high.
Shampoos and Conditioners
: Some
shampoos
and
conditioners
contain iodine as an active ingredient. These can be used as part of your regular hair care routine.
DIY Solutions
: Mix a few drops of iodine with a carrier oil (such as coconut or olive oil) and massage it into the scalp. Leave it on for a set amount of time (typically 20-30 minutes) before washing it off.
Potential Side Effects and Precautions
A substantial amount of iodine (e.g., several grams) can produce burning in the mouth, throat, and stomach, fever, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, a weak pulse, and coma. The daily iodine upper limits, which include intakes from all sources (food, beverages, and supplements), are listed here.
This medication may irritate your eyes, so keep it out of them. If you accidentally get any in your eyes, immediately rinse them with water. Topical iodine should not be used for deep puncture wounds, animal attacks, or severe burns. Doing so may raise the likelihood of side effects.
