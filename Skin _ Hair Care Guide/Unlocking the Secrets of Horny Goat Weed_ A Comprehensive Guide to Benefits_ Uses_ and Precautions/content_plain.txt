Skin and Hair Revitalization: Natural Beauty Enhancements
Several natural beauty ingredients and practices can promote healthier, more radiant skin and hair.  Here are some natural beauty enhancements to revitalise skin and hair:
Skin Revitalization
:
Proper hydration is essential for keeping skin healthy. Drink plenty of water all day to keep your skin hydrated from the inside out.

Apply a
moisturiser
that is appropriate for your skin type to keep it hydrated and supple. Look for
hyaluronic acid
, glycerin, and natural oils like jojoba or argan.
Wearing
sunscreen
every day, even on cloudy days, will protect your skin from the sun's harmful UV rays. Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher and reapply every 2 hours when outdoors.
Incorporate antioxidants into your skincare regimen to protect your skin from environmental damage and signs of ageing. Look for products that include
vitamins C
and E, green tea extract, or
niacinamide
.
To nourish your skin from within, consume a well-balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Foods rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids can help to improve skin health.

Hair Revitalization
:

shampoo
that does not strip away natural oils. Avoid overwashing, as it can cause dryness and damage.

Once a week, apply nourishing hair masks or treatments to restore moisture, repair damage, and increase shine. Look for masks that include ingredients such as
coconut oil

avocado oil
