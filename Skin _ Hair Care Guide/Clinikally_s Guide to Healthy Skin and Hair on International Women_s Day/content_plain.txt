Hair Care Revolution: Clinikally’s Approach
And here comes a bonus on this International Women’s Day!! As a part of Clinikally Women's Day specials, here are some Clinikally tips for lustrous, long locks. Professional hair care tips not only help maintain the health of your hair but can also enhance its appearance and texture. Here are expert recommendations for keeping your hair in top condition:
Trim Regularly: Professionals recommend getting your hair trimmed every 6-8 weeks to prevent split ends and maintain healthy
hair growth
.
Use the Right Shampoo: Choose a shampoo that suits your hair type. If you have dry hair, look for moisturising formulas. For oily hair, opt for clarifying shampoos.
Condition Correctly: Always use a conditioner after shampooing to replenish moisture. Apply conditioner mainly to the ends of your hair and avoid the scalp to prevent oiliness.
Limit Heat Styling: Frequent use of heat styling tools can damage your hair. Use a heat protectant spray and try to limit heat styling to special occasions.
Avoid Tight Hairstyles: Tight ponytails, braids, or buns can pull on your hair and cause breakage. Opt for loose hairstyles to reduce stress on your hair follicles.
Eat a Balanced Diet: Your hair's health is closely linked to your diet. Ensure you're getting enough protein, vitamins, and minerals to support hair growth.
Stay Hydrated: Drinking plenty of water is essential for maintaining the health of your hair, as hydration impacts your overall health and, by extension, your hair's vitality.
Use a Silk Pillowcase: Silk pillowcases can help reduce hair breakage caused by friction during the night compared to cotton pillowcases.
Protect Your Hair from the Sun: Just like your skin, your hair needs protection from harmful UV rays. Wear a hat or use hair products with UV protection when spending extended periods outdoors.
Deep Conditioning Treatments: Regular deep conditioning treatments can help restore moisture and repair damaged hair. Consider a professional treatment every few months for best results.
Following these professional Women's Day hair care Clinikally tips can significantly improve your hair's health, strength, and appearance, leading to a vibrant, healthy mane
