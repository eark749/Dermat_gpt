Glycerin is a commonly used ingredient in many skincare products due to its ability to hydrate and moisturise the skin. It is a colourless, odourless, and sweet-tasting liquid that is derived from plant oils and animal fats. In this blog, we will explore the benefits of using glycerin in your skincare routine, how to use it effectively, and the potential side effects to look out for.
Is glycerin good for your skin?
Glycerin is a
humectant
, which means that it attracts and retains moisture from the air and keeps it locked in the skin. This makes it an effective ingredient for dry skin, as it helps to hydrate and soothe the skin. It is also known to have a smoothing effect on rough and calloused skin.
In addition to its hydration benefits, glycerin has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, making it a good option for those with sensitive skin. It can also help to protect the skin from environmental stressors such as pollutants and
UV rays
.
Benefits of glycerin for different skin types
Glycerin, also known as glycerol, is a versatile and popular ingredient in skincare products due to its moisturising and hydrating properties. It is appropriate for a variety of skin types and provides several benefits:
Glycerin is extremely effective for dry skin because of its ability to attract moisture from the environment and lock it into the skin. It hydrates the skin, increasing its moisture content while decreasing dryness, flakiness, and roughness.
Glycerin is both moisturising and non-comedogenic, which means it will not
clog pores
or contribute to excessive oiliness. It provides light hydration without adding greasiness, making it ideal for oily or
acne
prone skin.
Glycerin is gentle and non-irritating, so it is suitable for sensitive skin. It soothes and calms irritation, redness, and inflammation, bringing relief to sensitive or reactive skin.
Glycerin is ideal for combination skin because it hydrates dry areas without increasing oiliness in the T-zone. It regulates moisture levels throughout the face, keeping the skin hydrated and comfortable.
Glycerin helps to maintain the skin's natural moisture barrier, which is critical in combating ageing signs like
fine lines and wrinkles
, and loss of elasticity. It helps plump and smooth the skin's surface, resulting in a more youthful and radiant complexion.
Glycerin is non-comedogenic and does not clog pores, making it ideal for acne-prone skin. It helps hydrate the skin without exacerbating acne or causing breakouts, making it a safe choice for individuals with acne concerns.
Myths vs. Facts about glycerin in skincare
Let us debunk some common myths and provide the facts about glycerin in skincare.
Myth 1
:
Glycerin is Sticky and Greasy
.
Fact
: Glycerin has a slightly sticky texture when used in high concentrations, but it is not inherently greasy. In skincare products, glycerin is often formulated in a way that absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving a smooth and hydrated feel without a greasy residue.
Myth 2
:
Glycerin is the cause of breakouts
.
Fact
: Glycerin does not clog pores or exacerbate acne because it is non-comedogenic. Glycerin, on the other hand, is good for skin that breaks out easily because it hydrates skin lightly without clogging pores or aggravating breakouts.
Myth 3
:
The skin loses moisture when using glycerin
.
Fact
: Glycerin is a humectant, which means that it draws moisture from the air into the skin and aids in its retention. If the environment is dry, glycerin can also pull moisture from the skin's deeper layers. In normal conditions, glycerin hydrates the skin without dehydrating it.
Myth 4
:
Glycerin Is Only For Dry Skin
.
Fact
: Glycerin works wonders for hydrating dry skin, but it works well for any type of skin. Glycerin is good for oily, sensitive, combination, and acne-prone skin types because it adds light moisture without making the skin appear greasy.
Myth 5
:
Excessive Concentrations of Glycerin Cause Damage
.
Fact
: Even at high concentrations, glycerin is generally safe to use in skincare products. It has a low risk of irritation or negative reactions, and most people tolerate it well. However, as with any ingredient, it is critical to adhere to recommended usage guidelines and avoid excessive use.
Myth 6
:
Glycerin does not provide long-term hydration
.
Fact
: Glycerin attracts and retains moisture in the skin, providing long-term hydration and gradually improving the skin's moisture barrier. While the effects may not last forever, regular use of glycerin-based products can provide long-term hydration and improve skin health.
Myth 7
:
Synthetic Glycerin Is Less Effective Than Natural Glycerin
.
Fact
: Glycerin can be found in skincare products in both natural and synthetic forms, and they work just as well. Synthetic glycerin goes through purification processes to ensure its quality and safety, making it a dependable and cost-effective alternative to natural glycerin.
You can choose wisely when adding glycerin-based products to your skincare routine and benefit from their benefits for hydrated, healthy skin by knowing the facts about glycerin in skincare.

Step-by-step guide to adding glycerin to your routine
Adding glycerin to your skincare routine is simple and can be tailored to your skin type and concerns. Here's a step-by-step guide for adding glycerin to your routine:
Patch Test
: Before applying glycerin to your entire face, perform a patch test to check for allergic reactions or sensitivity. Apply a small amount of diluted glycerin to a small area of your skin (for example, the inner forearm) and wait 24-48 hours to see if there is any redness, itching, or irritation.
Choose the Right Product
: Select a skincare product containing glycerin, such as a moisturizer, serum, toner, or mask. Look for products that include glycerin as one of the main ingredients, and select formulations that are appropriate for your skin type and concerns.
Cleanse Your Skin
: Begin by washing your face with a gentle, pH-balanced
cleanser
to remove dirt, oil, and impurities. Using a clean towel, gently dry your skin, leaving it slightly damp.
Apply Glycerin
: Depending on the product you have chosen, you can apply it directly to your skin or combine it with other skincare products. If using a glycerin-based moisturiser or serum, apply a small amount evenly to your face and neck, avoiding the eyes. If you use pure glycerin, dilute it with water or combine it with your favourite moisturiser or serum before applying it to your skin.
Massage Gently
: To ensure even coverage, massage the glycerin into your skin using gentle, upward motions. Focus on areas that tend to be dry or dull, such as the cheeks, forehead, and neck.
Permit Absorption
: Give your skin a few minutes to absorb the glycerin before using any more makeup or skincare products. Glycerin absorbs fast and should leave your skin feeling smooth and hydrated without leaving an oily afterglow.
Apply Sunscreen After Glycerin (During the Day)
: To shield your skin from UV rays, apply a
broad-spectrum sunscreen
with an SPF of 30 or higher after using glycerin. It is imperative to use sunscreen every day, especially if you are exposed to the sun, as glycerin does not offer sufficient protection against sunburn.
Repeat as Necessary
: Depending on the requirements and tolerance of your skin, you can use glycerin once or twice a day. Some people prefer to use glycerin as part of their morning or evening skincare routine, while others may use it as needed for added hydration throughout the day.
Monitor Your Skin
: Pay attention to how your skin responds to glycerin over time. If you experience irritation, sensitivity, or adverse reactions, stop using the product and
consult a dermatologist
.
By following these steps and incorporating glycerin into your skincare routine, you can benefit from its hydrating and soothing properties for healthy, radiant-looking skin.
Mixing glycerin with other skincare products
Mixing glycerin with other skincare products can improve hydration and overall effectiveness. Here's a guide for mixing glycerin with various types of skincare products:
Moisturiser
: Add a few drops of glycerin to your regular moisturiser to improve its hydrating properties. Mix the two products in your palm before applying them evenly to your face and neck. This can help your skin retain moisture and feel soft and supple.
Serum
: Mix glycerin with your favourite serum to increase its hydrating abilities. After cleansing your face and neck, mix a small amount of glycerin with the serum in your palm and apply to the area. Glycerin allows the serum to penetrate deeper into the skin and provide long-lasting hydration.
Toner
: Make your hydrating toner by combining glycerin and water or a floral hydrosol. Shake a few drops of glycerin into a spray bottle containing a small amount of water or hydrosol. Spray the mixture on your face after cleansing or throughout the day for a refreshing hydration boost.
Face Mask
: To increase hydration, add glycerin to your favourite
face mask
. Before applying the mask to your skin, add a few drops of glycerin. Leave the mask on for the recommended amount of time, then rinse with warm water to reveal hydrated, glowing skin.
Body Lotion
: Mix glycerin with your regular
body lotion
to extend its benefits. After showering, mix a few drops of glycerin and lotion in your hand and apply to damp skin. This will help your skin retain moisture and stay hydrated throughout the day.
Sunscreen
: Add glycerin to your sunscreen for extra hydration and protection. In the palm of your hand, mix a small amount of glycerin with your sunscreen and spread it evenly over your face and body. Glycerin can help prevent moisture loss caused by sun exposure and keep your skin hydrated under harsh UV rays.
When combining glycerin with other skincare products, start with a small amount and adjust the ratio to your skin's needs. Glycerin is extremely moisturising, so using too much may leave your skin feeling sticky or tacky. Experiment with different combinations until you find the ideal balance for your skin type and concerns.
Best time of day to apply glycerin-based products
The best time of day to use glycerin-based products is determined by your skincare routine and preferences. Here are some things to consider:
Morning
: Using glycerin-based products in the morning can help keep your skin hydrated and protected throughout the day. Glycerin helps to lock in moisture, resulting in a smooth, hydrated canvas for makeup application. It can also serve as a lightweight barrier against environmental stressors such as pollution and UV rays.
Evening
: By incorporating glycerin-based products into your evening skincare routine, they can work overnight to hydrate and replenish your skin. Glycerin helps to replenish moisture levels while you sleep, leaving your skin soft and refreshed in the morning. It can also help other skincare ingredients in your nighttime routine, like serums and moisturisers, absorb more effectively.
Both
: Some people prefer to use glycerin-based products in the morning and evening to ensure maximum hydration and healthy skin. This method provides consistent moisture throughout the day and night, preventing dryness and dehydration.
Long-term benefits of using glycerin in skincare
Using glycerin in skincare has several long-term benefits for your skin:
Hydration
: Glycerin is a humectant, which means it draws moisture from the environment and helps keep it in the skin. Regular use of glycerin-based products can help improve skin hydration levels over time, reducing dryness, flakiness, and rough texture.
Barrier Repair
: To shield the skin from environmental stresses and stop moisture loss, glycerin helps to fortify the skin's natural moisture barrier. Glycerin can enhance the general resilience and health of the skin by preserving good
barrier function
.
Anti-Aging Effects
: Proper hydration is essential for maintaining youthful skin. Glycerin plumps and smoothes the skin's surface, reducing the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and dehydration lines with time. It also promotes
collagen
production, which can enhance skin elasticity and firmness.
Soothing Properties
: Glycerin has calming and anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce irritation and redness. Regular use of glycerin-based products can help to soothe sensitive or reactive skin, resulting in a more even and comfortable complexion.
Improved Skin Texture
: Glycerin can help improve skin texture and tone over time by hydrating and exfoliating the skin. It can soften rough spots, reduce the appearance of pores, and improve overall skin smoothness for a more refined appearance.
Enhanced Product Penetration
: Glycerin improves the penetration of other skincare ingredients, allowing them to reach deeper layers of the skin and be more effective. This can improve the effectiveness of your skincare routine and address specific issues like
hyperpigmentation
, acne, or uneven skin tone.
Environmental Protection
: Glycerin forms a protective barrier on the skin's surface, shielding it from pollutants, UV radiation, and harsh weather conditions. Over time, this barrier can help reduce the cumulative effects of environmental damage and maintain skin health.
How to choose the right glycerin product for your skincare needs
Choosing the best glycerin product for your skincare needs requires taking into account a variety of factors, including your skin type, concerns, and personal preferences. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you choose the best glycerin product.
Determine your skin type (dry, oily, combination, sensitive, or normal) to narrow your product options. Glycerin is generally suitable for all skin types, though some formulations may be better suited to specific concerns.
Identify your main skincare issues, such as dryness, dehydration, ageing, sensitivity, acne, or uneven texture. Look for glycerin products that address these concerns and include extra ingredients tailored to your specific requirements.
Glycerin is found in a variety of skincare formulations, including moisturisers, serums, toners, cleansers, masks, and body lotions. Select a formulation based on your preferences and how you like to incorporate products into your skincare routine.
Examine the ingredient list for glycerin products to ensure that they contain high-quality, effective ingredients with few potential irritants or allergens. Look for glycerin listed near the top of the ingredient list for maximum potency.
Consider whether you want glycerin products with additional beneficial ingredients, such as
hyaluronic acid
for extra hydration,
antioxidants
for environmental protection, or soothing botanical extracts to calm sensitive skin.
Pay attention to the packaging of glycerin products to ensure they're hygienic and convenient to use. Opt for air-tight containers or pumps to minimise contamination and preserve the product's efficacy over time.
Research glycerin products online and read reviews from other users to learn about their experiences and results. Look for products with positive reviews and recommendations from individuals with similar skin concerns and preferences.
Determine your skincare budget and compare the value of different glycerin products. While some products may be more expensive, they may contain higher concentrations of glycerin or other beneficial ingredients that make the cost worthwhile.
Before fully committing to a new glycerin product, conduct a patch test to detect any allergic reactions or sensitivity. Apply a small amount of the product to a discreet area of your skin and wait 24-48 hours to see if any side effects occur.
By following these steps and taking into account your skin type, concerns, preferences, and budget, you can select the best glycerin product to effectively address your skincare needs. If you have any specific concerns or questions, consult a dermatologist or skincare professional for personalised recommendations.
Addressing common concerns with glycerin use in skincare
Addressing common concerns about glycerin use in skincare entails identifying potential issues and implementing mitigation measures. Here are some common concerns and how to handle them:
Stickiness or Tackiness
: Glycerin can leave a sticky or tacky residue on the skin, particularly when used in high concentrations or humid environments. To reduce stickiness, use glycerin-based products with lighter textures or dilute pure glycerin with water before application. In addition, layering a lightweight moisturiser or serum on top of glycerin can help reduce tackiness while still providing moisture.
Potential for Irritation
: While most skin types tolerate glycerin well, some people may experience irritation or sensitivity, particularly if they have allergies or sensitivities to specific ingredients. To reduce the risk of irritation, patch-test new glycerin products before applying them to larger areas of the skin. Start by applying a small amount to a discreet area, such as the inner forearm, and monitor for any adverse reactions over 24-48 hours.
Drying Effect in Dry Environments
: Glycerin may cause skin dryness in arid conditions if the surrounding air is devoid of humidity. Consider utilising glycerin-based products in addition to a humidifier to raise the air's moisture content to avoid this. Additionally, by absorbing moisture from the air, glycerin applied to damp skin can intensify its moisturising properties.
Potential for Pore Clogging
: Although glycerin is non-comedogenic and does not typically clog pores, people with acne-prone or oily skin may be concerned that it will exacerbate breakouts. To reduce the risk of pore clogging, use glycerin-based products labelled as non-comedogenic and avoid heavy or occlusive formulations. Also, make sure to thoroughly cleanse your skin to remove any excess product residue.
Product Stability and Shelf Life
: Glycerin-based products are susceptible to spoilage or degradation over time, particularly when exposed to air, light, or high temperatures. To extend the shelf life of glycerin products, keep them in a cool, dark place out of direct sunlight and tightly seal the packaging after each use. Additionally, check the expiration date of glycerin products and discard any that have passed it.
By addressing these common concerns and implementing appropriate strategies, you can get the most out of glycerin in your skincare routine while minimising potential drawbacks or issues. If you have any specific concerns or questions about using glycerin in your skincare routine, contact a dermatologist or skincare professional for personalised advice and recommendations.
