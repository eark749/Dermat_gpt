<p><span>Certain plant extracts may benefit acne-prone skin by reducing inflammation and promoting healing. Here are some natural methods that have been proven effective:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Aloe vera</b><span>: Aloe vera has been tested when used with standard anti-acne medications, and the findings are promising. If you have mild to moderate acne and are seeking for a gentle way to calm your skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Apple cider vinegar:</b><span> Apple cider vinegar aids in acne therapy through two key actions: antibacterial and keratolytic, which cause the skin's outer cells to peel. We'll go through them one by one. One of the primary causes of acne is a bacteria known as Propionibacterium acnes or P. acnes. It can induce inflammation and scarring of skin cells. Apple cider vinegar includes acetic, succinic, and citric acids, all of which can destroy the bacteria P. acnes. Clinical investigations have shown that applying lactic acid to the face reduces acne significantly. ACV can also help eliminate dead skin cells. However, specific evidence for using apple cider vinegar in acne is limited.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Green tea</b><span>: Green tea contains chemicals known as catechins. These plant-based molecules, known as polyphenols, have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial effects. They also target free radicals. Green tea is particularly high in epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a polyphenol that has been demonstrated to reduce acne and greasy face. In addition to anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial effects, EGCG decreases lipid levels and is anti-androgenic, making it beneficial in lowering sebum (oil) secretion in the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Honey</b><span>: Honey can also be used as a spot treatment for acne by putting a small quantity to a pimple and letting it sit on the skin to work its magic. Alternatively, honey can be used as a soothing and gentle daily <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-foaming-face-wash">cleanser</a> for acne-prone skin by massaging a tiny bit into the face and immediately rinsing with warm water.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Tea tree oil</b><span>: The benefits of utilizing tea tree oil for acne. Tea tree oil contains anti-inflammatory and antibacterial characteristics, making it an excellent choice for treating acne-prone skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Turmeric</b><span>: Both fresh and powdered turmeric are great acne treatment options. If you have a lot of time, grind fresh turmeric and apply it straight to acne-prone skin so that the turmeric essence is easily absorbed and efficiently treats dark spots.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Zinc</b><span>: Zinc is a vital mineral that improves immune function. It can lessen the inflammatory response associated with acne. Zinc influences cell synthesis and turnover, which can aid in reducing the quantity of natural oil your skin produces. This minimizes congestion, which keeps pores from clogging.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sulfur</b><span>: Sulphur is an antiseptic that also has antibacterial and antifungal effects. This means that when applied to the skin, it fights the acne-causing bacterium, P acnes. This activity is comparable to that of benzoyl peroxide, which is bactericidal or kills germs on the surface.</span></p>
