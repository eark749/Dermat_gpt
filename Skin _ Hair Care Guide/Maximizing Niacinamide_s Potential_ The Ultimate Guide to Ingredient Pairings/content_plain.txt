Niacinamide, a type of vitamin B3, has quickly become a key part of skincare routines because it can help with many skin problems. It's able to fit well into lots of different skincare products and make them work better. This guide explains how niacinamide works with other ingredients to make skin look its best.
Niacinamide is great at making the skin's barrier stronger, controlling oil, shrinking pores, and reducing wrinkles. When it's used with hyaluronic acid, which holds moisture in the skin, niacinamide can make skin look plump and hydrated. Mixing it with zinc helps fight acne because zinc calms down red, angry skin.
It's also helpful to pair niacinamide with vitamin C to make skin brighter and fade dark spots. But you have to be careful when using them together so they don't irritate your skin. And if you use niacinamide with retinol, it can reduce the side effects of retinol like redness and peeling, making your skin stronger against aging.
This guide is here to help you understand how to use niacinamide in your skincare routine to get the best results for healthy, glowing skin.

For optimal results, apply vitamin C serum in the morning to take advantage of its antioxidant properties and protect the skin from environmental aggressors. Niacinamide can follow in your evening routine to repair skin and maintain hydration. Alternatively, if your skin tolerates it, layer vitamin C and niacinamide at the same time, starting with the vitamin C serum followed by niacinamide. This combination illuminates the skin from within, promoting a visibly brighter and more uniform complexion.
Rejuvenating Skin with Glycolic Acid and Niacinamide: A Winning Pair
Combining glycolic acid, an AHA known for its exfoliating properties, with niacinamide offers a holistic approach to skin rejuvenation.
