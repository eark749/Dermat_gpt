Healing inflamed and peeling cuticles requires a combination of care, moisture, and careful maintenance. This blog is a detailed guide to revitalising your nails and boosting the condition of your cuticles.
Understanding Cuticle Health
Understanding cuticle health is critical for overall nail health and preventing problems such as dryness, peeling, irritation, and infections. This blog provides an in-depth look at cuticle health.
Causes of Swollen and Peeling Cuticles
External irritants, a lack of moisture, infections, or underlying health concerns can all contribute to swollen and peeling cuticles. Dryness and dehydration,
intensive nail care practises
, allergic reactions or irritants, infections, health issues, nutritional deficiencies, trauma or injury, environmental variables, hormonal shifts, and underlying medical conditions are some of the most common reasons. If swollen and peeling cuticles persist or become painful,
consult a dermatologist
or healthcare professional, especially if an infection or underlying health issue is suspected.
The Importance of Nail Hydration
Hydrating your nails is essential for their health, strength, and look. Here are some of the benefits of nail hydration: preventing dryness and brittle nails, increasing nail flexibility, improving nail health, preserving cuticle health, protecting against external causes, minimising nail issues, and promoting nail paint adherence. Hydration not only prevents nail disorders, but it also increases strength, flexibility, and resilience, all of which contribute to healthier and more beautiful nails. Maintaining the strength and appearance of your nails requires including hydration in your nail care routine.
Nutrition and Vitamins for Cuticle Strength
The importance of nutrition in maintaining healthy cuticles and overall nail health cannot be overstated.  Including specific vitamins and nutrients in your diet can help you have stronger, healthier cuticles. The following nutrients and vitamins are important for cuticle strength:
Biotin (Vitamin B7):
Biotin is well-known for its ability to promote healthy hair, skin, and nails, including cuticles. Eggs, nuts (almonds, peanuts), seeds (sunflower seeds), whole grains, bananas, and leafy green vegetables are all good sources.

:
Vitamin C is required for collagen synthesis
, which is necessary for healthy nail growth and cuticle strength. Citrus fruits (oranges, lemons), strawberries, bell peppers, kiwi, and leafy greens are good sources.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
: Omega-3 fatty acids aid in the retention of moisture in the nails and cuticles, preventing dryness and brittleness. Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel), flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, and soybeans are good sources.
Iron
: Iron promotes healthy blood flow, ensuring proper nutrient delivery to the nails and cuticles. Red meat, poultry, lentils, beans, tofu, spinach, and fortified cereals are all good sources.
Zinc
: Zinc promotes healthy nail growth and repair by supporting the immune system. Oysters, beef, poultry, pumpkin seeds, lentils, and chickpeas.
Protein
:
Protein is crucial for keratin production, the main structural protein in nails and cuticles. Lean meats, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy products, legumes, nuts, and seeds.
