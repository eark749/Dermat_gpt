<h3><b>Causes of Swollen and Peeling Cuticles</b></h3>

<h3><b>The Importance of Nail Hydration</b></h3>
<p><span>Hydrating your nails is essential for their health, strength, and look. Here are some of the benefits of nail hydration: preventing dryness and brittle nails, increasing nail flexibility, improving nail health, preserving cuticle health, protecting against external causes, minimising nail issues, and promoting nail paint adherence.
