<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Curd is high in natural fats, proteins, and vitamins, making it an excellent <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hydrasoothe-moisturiser">moisturiser</a> for facial skin. Its emollient properties help to retain moisture, leaving your skin hydrated, soft, and supple.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The lactic acid in curd acts as a gentle exfoliant, removing dead skin cells and unclogging pores. This process increases cell turnover, resulting in fresher, smoother skin and a more radiant complexion.</span></p>

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Mild Exfoliation</b><span>: The lactic acid in curd acts as a mild exfoliant, encouraging the replacement of dead skin cells and removing them from the skin. This exfoliating process improves the texture and appearance of the skin by exposing healthy, new skin underneath.</span></p>
