<div></div>
<p><span>Onychomycosis, or nail fungus, is a common condition caused by fungal infections. Here's an overview of its causes and symptoms:</span></p>
<h4>
<b>Causes</b><span>:</span>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Dermatophytes are a type of fungi that are responsible for the majority of nail fungus. These fungi thrive in warm, moist environments and can infect nails via small cuts or gaps between the nail and the nail bed.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Other fungi, including yeasts and moulds, can cause nail infections. These microorganisms can enter the nail through skin cracks and breaks.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Poor hygiene, trauma, warm and humid environments, wearing tight-fitting shoes, and a weakened immune system all increase the risk of developing nail fungus.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<b>Symptoms</b><span>:</span>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Infected nails can become discoloured, usually yellow, brown, or white. In some cases, the nail can develop black spots or streaks.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>As the infection progresses, the nail may thicken and change shape. It may also become brittle and susceptible to crumbling or splitting.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The affected nail may acquire a rough or crumbly texture, and debris may accumulate beneath it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>In some cases, nail fungus can cause pain or discomfort, particularly when pressure is applied to the affected nail.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Infected nails can emit a foul odour, especially if debris or infection accumulates beneath the nail.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Without treatment, nail fungus can spread to other nails or the surrounding skin, resulting in more infections.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Identifying the Signs of Nail Fungus<br/></b></h3>
<p><span>Early detection of nail fungus symptoms can help with prompt treatment. Here are some common signs to watch out for:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Discoloration</b><span>: Changes in nail colour are one of the first signs of nail fungus.The nail may become yellow, brown, white, or even black.  The discoloration may begin at the tip of the nail and spread to the base.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Thickening</b><span>: Infected nails frequently thicken and may become distorted. They may lose their smooth appearance and acquire a rough texture.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Brittleness</b><span>: Fungal infections can make nails brittle and susceptible to breaking, splitting, or crumbling. This brittleness can affect both the surface and the edges of the nail. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Distorted shape:</b><span> Nails affected by fungus may change shape, becoming curved, ridged, or uneven. In severe cases, the nail may separate from the nail bed, a condition known as onycholysis.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Debris buildup</b><span>: Skin cells, nail fragments, and fungal material can accumulate beneath the affected nail. This buildup can cause discoloration and a foul odour.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Foul odour</b><span>: Nail fungus can emit a strong, unpleasant odour, especially if debris or infection accumulates beneath the nail. The odour may be detectable even without a close inspection.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Pain or discomfort</b><span>: In some cases, nail fungus can cause pain or discomfort, particularly when pressure is applied to the affected nail. This can make it uncomfortable to wear shoes or walk.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Spread to other nails</b><span>: If left untreated, nail fungus can spread to other nails on the same foot or hand, as well as to the surrounding skin. It's essential to monitor all nails for signs of infection if one nail is affected.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>How Hydrogen Peroxide Fights Fungal Infections</b></h3>
<p><span>Hydrogen peroxide is a common household disinfectant that effectively combats fungal infections. This is how it works.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Antiseptic properties</b><span>: Hydrogen peroxide has strong antiseptic properties, which means it can kill or prevent the growth of microorganisms like bacteria, viruses, and fungi. When applied to the affected area, hydrogen peroxide kills the fungus causing the infection.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Release of oxygen</b><span>: Hydrogen peroxide reacts with organic materials, like fungi, to produce water and oxygen.  By interfering with the fungus's cellular functions and preventing its growth, the oxygen release makes the environment unfriendly to it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Antifungal activity</b><span>: Research has shown that hydrogen peroxide has antifungal properties, making it effective against a wide range of fungal species, including those that cause nail fungus. It can penetrate the nail and reach the site of infection, thereby aiding in the fungus's removal.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Ease of use</b><span>: Hydrogen peroxide is simple to use and readily available in most pharmacies and grocery stores. It can be used directly on the affected nail or diluted with water for a milder solution. Soaking the affected nail in hydrogen peroxide solution can help to ensure full coverage and penetration.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Safe and inexpensive</b><span>: When used as directed, hydrogen peroxide is generally considered safe for topical application. It is an inexpensive treatment option for fungal infections, especially in mild to moderate cases.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>While hydrogen peroxide can be an effective treatment for nail fungus, it is critical to use it correctly and seek guidance from a healthcare professional, especially if the infection is severe or persists even after treatment. Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide may not be appropriate for everyone, so it is critical to consider personal factors such as allergies or sensitivities before using it. </span></p>
