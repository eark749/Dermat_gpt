Choosing the best sunscreen requires taking into account several elements, including UV protection and the impact on the environment, particularly coral reefs. Based on their active constituents, sunscreens are classified as either physical (mineral) or chemical (organic). This blog will go over both categories, with a focus on reef safety.
Understanding Physical and Chemical Sunscreens
The active components in physical and chemical sunscreens differ, as does how they protect the skin from the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This blog compares physical and chemical sunscreens. Physical sunscreens create a physical barrier between the skin and the sun. They sit on the surface of the skin and reflect or scatter UV light away from it. These sunscreens are commonly known as "mineral" sunscreens. Organic molecules in chemical sunscreens absorb UV light. These molecules go through a chemical reaction that turns UV radiation into heat, which is subsequently expelled from the skin. Consider your skin type, any sensitivities you may have, and your environmental concerns before selecting a sunscreen. If reef safety is a consideration, choose a "reef-safe" sunscreen or a physical sunscreen. Always read product labels and remain up to date on the latest research on sunscreen ingredients and their effects on skin health and the environment.
Composition and Benefits of Physical Sunscreens
Physical sunscreens, often known as mineral sunscreens, include active mineral components that lie on the skin's surface and provide a physical barrier against ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are the two most common minerals found in physical sunscreens. Here's a closer look at their makeup and the advantages of physical sunscreens:
Composition
:
Zinc Oxide
: Zinc oxide is a white, powdery mineral. UV Protection: It provides broad-spectrum UVA and UVB ray protection. Known for being gentle on the skin, making it suitable for those with sensitive skin. These ingredients are less irritating than some chemical sunscreen ingredients. A reef-safe and environmentally friendly product.
Titanium Dioxide
: Titanium dioxide is yet another white, powdery mineral. Protects from both UVA and UVB rays. Most people with sensitive skin tolerate it well. Titanium dioxide, like zinc oxide, is considered reef safe.
Benefits
:
Broad-Spectrum Protection
: Physical sunscreens provide all-around sun protection by blocking both UVA and UVB rays.
Immediate Effectiveness
: Physical sunscreens begin to protect the skin as soon as they are applied because they form a physical barrier.
Gentle on Sensitive Skin
: Physical sunscreens are suitable for delicate skin because zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are mild and less likely to irritate.
Reef Safe
: Physical sunscreen minerals like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, unlike other chemical sunscreen components, are considered reef-safe, making them a preferable choice for environmentally conscious consumers.
Stability
:
Physical sunscreens are more stable in sunlight than chemical filters, which can degrade over time.
Reduced Risk of Irritation
:
Physical sunscreens may be less irritating to those with skin problems such as rosacea or eczema than chemical sunscreens.
No Absorption into the Skin
:
Physical sunscreens sit on the skin's surface and are not absorbed into the bloodstream, which is important for those concerned about sunscreen ingredient systemic absorption.
Consider your skin type, preferences, and any special skin concerns before choosing a physical sunscreen. To maximise sun protection, always follow the product's application and reapplication directions.
How Chemical Sunscreens Work
Chemical sunscreens, also known as organic sunscreens, absorb UV light and convert it to heat, which is then discharged from the skin. These sunscreens' active components are organic (carbon-based) molecules, each with unique capabilities for absorbing distinct wavelengths of UV light. This blog will look at how chemical sunscreens work.
Comparing SPF and UV Protection Levels
UV (Ultraviolet) and SPF (Sun Protection Factor) protection levels are related yet represent separate features of sunscreens. Understanding both can assist you in selecting the best sunscreen for your needs.
SPF (Sun Protection Factor)
:
The SPF of a sunscreen indicates how well it protects the skin from UVB (shortwave ultraviolet B) rays. It denotes the degree of protection against sunburn induced by UVB radiation.  SPF is computed by comparing the time it takes for skin to burn with and without sunscreen. For example, if your skin burns in 10 minutes without sunscreen, then SPF 30 should provide 30 times that protection (300 minutes). SPF primarily measures UVB light protection, which causes sunburn and contributes to the development of skin cancer. SPF does not provide information regarding UVA ray protection, which is linked to accelerated ageing and can also contribute to skin cancer.
UV Protection Levels
: A "broad-spectrum" sunscreen protects against both UVA and UVB rays. Look for this designation to assure full protection. Some countries have implemented a UVA protection rating system. In Asia, for example, the PA system (Protection Grade of UVA) is widely used, with rising plus signs signifying greater UVA protection. While SPF primarily refers to UVB protection, higher SPF values frequently correlate with better overall UV protection, including some UVA protection. In some areas, UVA protection is measured using the Persistent
Pigment Darkening
(PPD) grade. The better the UVA protection, the higher the PPD number.
Remember that no sunscreen offers complete protection and that proper application and reapplication are essential for effective sun protection. Furthermore, choosing sunscreens with high SPF values does not imply that you can spend indefinite amounts of time in the sun; it is always important to be mindful of sun exposure.
The Environmental Impact of Sunscreen Ingredients
The environmental impact of sunscreen ingredients has become a growing concern, particularly about their effects on coral reefs and marine ecosystems. Some sunscreen ingredients have been identified as potentially harmful to aquatic environments. Here are some key considerations regarding the environmental impact of sunscreen ingredients:
Reef-Safe Labeling
: Look for sunscreens that are labelled "reef-safe" or "reef-friendly." These formulations typically do not contain any potentially harmful ingredients.
Mineral Sunscreens
:
Choose mineral (physical) sunscreens with active ingredients such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. These are generally thought to be environmentally friendly.
Check Ingredient Lists
:
Sunscreens containing oxybenzone, octinoxate, and other potentially harmful chemicals should be avoided.
Water-Resistant Formulas
:

Effective sun protection requires proper sunscreen application. Some best practices to ensure you get the most out of your sunscreen are choosing the right sunscreen, applying it every day, applying sunscreen to all exposed skin, applying sunscreen 15-30 minutes before sun exposure, using enough sunscreen, reapplying every two hours, reapply after swimming or sweating, be mindful of sunscreen expiration dates, use sunscreen with different forms of sun exposure, apply sunscreen to children, don't forget often-missed areas, protect lips, consider your skin type, combine sunscreen with other sun protection measures, be mindful of medications, pay attention to sunscreen application techniques, consider different formulations, educate yourself about sunscreen ingredients, sunscreen in makeup, and reapply during prolonged sun exposure. By adhering to these best practices, you can increase the effectiveness of your sunscreen while decreasing your risk of sunburn,
premature ageing
, and skin cancer. Always read and follow the product label directions for the sunscreen you are using.
Understanding Biodegradable and Water-Resistant Options
Understanding the ideas of biodegradable and water-resistant sunscreen solutions is critical for making environmentally conscious decisions. Here's an explanation for each:
Biodegradable Sunscreens
:
Definition
: Biodegradable sunscreens contain chemicals that degrade and break down naturally in the environment. This decreases the sunscreen's influence on ecosystems.
Key Points
: Biodegradable sunscreens are intended to reduce the persistence of sunscreen chemicals in water and soil, hence minimising the risk of harm to aquatic life. While biodegradable sunscreens are frequently regarded as reef-safe, not all reef-safe sunscreens are biodegradable. Reef-safe sunscreens may not contain dangerous ingredients, but they may not degrade as quickly in the ecosystem.
Ingredients
: Natural and plant-based chemicals that disintegrate naturally are frequently used in biodegradable sunscreens. Look for products that contain zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and herbal extracts.
Certifications
: Some biodegradable sunscreens may come with certifications or labels showing that they meet particular environmental criteria. It is critical to read product labels and grasp the manufacturer's specific claims.
Water-Resistant Sunscreens
:
Definition
: Water-resistant sunscreens are designed to remain effective even when exposed to water, such as during swimming or sweating. They offer some protection even when the skin is wet.
Key Points
: Water-resistant sunscreens can withstand the effects of water for a set period. Water resistance is frequently specified on the product label (for example, 40 minutes or 80 minutes). Regardless of water resistance, water-resistant sunscreen must be reapplied after the indicated period or shortly after swimming, sweating, or towel drying.
Testing Standards
: Sunscreens' water resistance is tested using standardised procedures, and the results are displayed on the product package. Water resistance levels that are commonly used are 40 minutes and 80 minutes.
Application Instructions
: Apply the sunscreen liberally and evenly to all exposed skin areas to ensure water resistance, and make sure to adhere to the suggested reapplication schedule.
It is crucial to remember that, while biodegradable and water-resistant solutions address certain needs, preferences, and environmental concerns, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. To make an informed decision, consider several criteria such as skin type, outdoor activity, and environmental impact, while selecting the correct sunscreen.
Conclusion: Balancing Skin Protection and Environmental Responsibility
When choosing and applying sunscreen, it is critical to strike a balance between skin protection and environmental responsibility. Consider prioritising skin protection, environmental responsibility, balancing acts, education, and activism, alternate sun protection, and consulting with professionals as key takeaways. Individuals have a critical role in making educated decisions in the continuous quest for a balance between skin protection and environmental responsibility. We can benefit ourselves and the globe by prioritising both skin health and environmental sustainability.
