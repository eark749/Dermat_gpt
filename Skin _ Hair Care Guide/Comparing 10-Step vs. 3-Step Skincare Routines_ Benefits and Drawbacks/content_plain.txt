The decision between the 10-step and 3-step skincare routines frequently comes down to personal preferences, skin type, and lifestyle. Each has advantages and disadvantages of its own. In this blog, let's examine each in detail.
Understanding the 10-Step Skincare Routine
The 10-step skincare routine is a thorough method of skincare that is designed to achieve healthy, glowing skin. It originated from Korean beauty techniques. Here's a breakdown of each stage in the skincare routine: exfoliation, toner, essence, serum or ampoule, sheet mask,
eye cream
, moisturiser,
sunscreen
, and water- or oil-based
cleanser
. It's important to remember that not every step may be required for every person, and the regimen can be altered to suit each person's skin type and concerns.
Origins and Philosophy of the 10-Step Routine
The 10-step skincare regimen was developed in South Korea, where people value skincare highly and see it as an integral component of beauty and self-care. Its guiding principle is the conviction that regular, focused skincare regimens can lead to healthy, glowing skin. The beginnings of the 10-step regimen and its guiding principles are attributed to multiple factors:
The quest for healthy, bright skin and natural beauty is frequently valued more highly in Korean beauty culture than extensive makeup. A holistic approach to wellbeing and self-care is reflected in this emphasis on skincare as the cornerstone of beauty.
The layering technique used in the 10-step regimen allows many lightweight products to be applied in thin layers, providing optimum efficacy by allowing each product to penetrate deeply into the skin. It is thought that this method addresses a variety of skin issues more thoroughly.
The 10-step approach emphasizes prevention and maintenance rather than waiting for skin problems to surface. It uses procedures including double washing, exfoliation, hydration, and UV protection to keep skin healthy and take care of possible issues before they become serious.
Customization is one of the fundamental tenets of the 10-step routine. It acknowledges that every person has a varied type of skin with distinct demands and concerns. As a result, people are urged to customise their skincare regimen by choosing products that specifically target their skin type, concerns, and preferences.
The 10-step programme prioritises long-term outcomes above temporary solutions. It recognises that maintaining good skincare is a journey that calls for perseverance, commitment, and consistency. Through consistent use of premium skincare products and a regimen, people can eventually attain and preserve glowing, healthy skin.
Detailed Breakdown of Each Step
The 10-step skincare programme is broken down into the following steps in detail:
Oil-Based Cleanser
:
Eliminates excess sebum, sunscreen, makeup, and other oil-based pollutants without depleting the skin of its natural oils. On dry skin, apply the cleanser and gently massage in circular strokes. Use warm water to rinse.
Water-Based Cleanser
: Cleanses the skin of water-based impurities like sweat and dirt, ensuring a thorough cleansing. Apply to damp skin and lather into a foam. Massage gently and rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water.
Exfoliation
:
Removes dead skin cells, unclogs pores, and promotes skin renewal, leading to smoother and brighter skin. 1-3 times per week, depending on skin sensitivity. Physical exfoliants (scrubs) or chemical exfoliants (products containing AHAs, BHAs, or enzymes).
Toner
:
Balances the skin's pH levels, hydrates, and preps the skin to better absorb subsequent skincare products. Pour onto a cotton pad or pat directly onto the skin with clean hands.
Essence
:
Lightweight, hydrating formulations that penetrate deeply to deliver active ingredients, promoting skin hydration and vitality. Pat onto the skin using fingertips or dispense onto a cotton pad and gently swipe across the face.
Serum or Ampoule
: Highly concentrated formulations targeting specific skin concerns such as
wrinkles
,
hyperpigmentation
, or
acne
. Apply a few drops onto the fingertips and gently pat or massage onto the skin.
Sheet Mask
: Provides an intense boost of hydration and nourishment, delivering active ingredients to the skin. Apply the mask onto clean skin, leave it on for 10-20 minutes, then remove and pat any excess essence into the skin.
Eye Cream
:
Hydrates, firms, and brightens the delicate skin around the eyes, reducing the appearance of dark circles and fine lines. Gently pat a small amount around the eye area using the ring finger.
Moisturizer
:
Locks in hydration, strengthens the skin barrier, and prevents moisture loss, keeping the skin soft and supple. Apply evenly onto the face and neck, gently massaging until fully absorbed.
Sunscreen
: Protects the skin from harmful UV rays, preventing sun damage, premature aging, and skin cancer. Apply generously as the last step of the morning skincare routine, reapplying throughout the day as needed.
Benefits of a Comprehensive Skincare Routine
All things considered, a thorough skincare regimen enhances people's general health, comfort, and confidence in addition to their appearance. People can develop and maintain beautiful, healthy skin that lasts a lifetime by devoting time and effort to skincare.
Simplifying with the 3-Step Skincare Routine
The three-step skincare programme is easy to follow and effective, yet it still gives the skin the vital care it needs. Below is a summary of each phase and its advantages:
Cleansing
: Its goal is to keep skin clear and fresh by eliminating debris, oil, and pollutants. Benefits include preventing acne, removing makeup, and priming the skin for optimal skincare product absorption. The product is a mild, skin-type-appropriate cleanser with a pH balance.
Moisturizing
: The goal is to keep the skin's natural barrier intact, seal in moisture, and hydrate the skin. Benefits include keeping the skin elastic and moist, preventing dryness, and relieving inflammation. Products include moisturising gels or light moisturisers that are appropriate for your skin type.
Sun Protection
: The goal is to protect the skin from damaging UV radiation, reducing the risk of sunburn, early ageing, and skin cancer. Benefits include preventing sun damage, lowering the chance of wrinkles and sunspots, and preserving the health of the skin. Applying a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher every day, even on overcast days, is the product.
For all skin types, the 3-step programme provides an easy-to-follow, simplified approach to skincare. It focuses on the three key components of a good skincare routine: washing, moisturising, and sun protection. You can easily maintain clean, moisturised, and protected skin by including five easy actions in your daily routine.
Key Steps in a 3-Step Routine
A basic skincare routine that takes care of the three most important needs—cleansing, hydration, and protection—is built around these three processes. Although this regimen might not seem like much, it effectively takes care of the skin and can be tailored with more products or treatments as needed.
Benefits & Drawbacks of a Minimalist Approach
A minimalist approach to skincare is simple and effective, concentrating on fundamental tasks while avoiding extraneous items and complications. Here are some advantages and disadvantages.
Benefits
:
A minimalist skincare routine is simple to follow and takes little time and effort. It makes skin care easier for everyone, particularly those with busy schedules.
A minimalist lifestyle can save money because it requires fewer goods to purchase. You can spend less money on higher-quality products or therapies that provide greater outcomes.
Using fewer products lowers the risk of irritating or sensitising the skin. Minimalist routines often include gentle, non-comedogenic products, making them appropriate for sensitive or reactive skin.
A minimalist approach guarantees that you are meeting your skin's basic needs by prioritising important processes such as washing, moisturising, and sun protection. This foundational care can result in healthier, more balanced skin over time.
A minimalist routine can easily adapt to changes in your skin or lifestyle. Whether you're travelling, experiencing seasonal changes, or simply need to simplify your routine, the core principles remain the same.
Drawbacks
:
A minimalist approach may not meet all of your skin's requirements, particularly if you have specific conditions such as acne, hyperpigmentation, or ageing. Additional goods or treatments may be required to address these difficulties properly.
With fewer products in your routine, there is less room for customisation based on your specific skin type, issues, or preferences. This may result in unsatisfactory outcomes for certain people.
While minimalist routines focus on essentials, they may overlook certain beneficial ingredients or treatments that could enhance skin health or address specific concerns. This could lead to missed opportunities for improving your skin's condition.
For skincare enthusiasts or people who like to experiment with different products and formulations, a minimalist approach may feel limiting. It may not satisfy the need to try new skincare trends, substances, or processes.
In some cases, a minimalist approach may oversimplify skincare, leading to neglect of important aspects like proper cleansing or sun protection. It's important to strike a balance between simplicity and effectiveness in your routine.
Pros and Cons of 10-Step and 3-Step Routines
Let's look at the advantages and disadvantages of both the 10-step and 3-step skincare routines:
10-Step Skincare Routine:
Pros
:
The 10-step programme provides a comprehensive approach to skincare, covering cleaning, exfoliation, hydration, and specialised treatments. This thorough approach can help to enhance skin health and appearance.
With many steps and items to pick from, the 10-step process provides for a great degree of customisation. Individuals can personalise their routine to their skin type, issues, and preferences, choosing items that meet their specific requirements.
The multi-step strategy allows for the use of specialised treatments such as serums, ampoules, and masks that address specific skincare issues such as acne, hyperpigmentation, and ageing. This enables more tailored treatment and improved results over time.
A 10-step skincare programme can be both ceremonial and self-care-oriented. It encourages relaxation, awareness, and pampering, improving general well-being beyond skin care.
Cons
:
The 10-step routine involves a major time investment, particularly for people with hectic schedules. Some people may struggle to invest the time and effort required for each stage, resulting in inconsistency or neglect of the practice.
With many products involved, the expense of a 10-step routine can quickly escalate. High-quality skincare products can be costly, and keeping a comprehensive line of products may not be possible for everyone, especially those on a low budget.
Using too many products in a single routine might overload the skin, especially if they contain strong active ingredients or if the skin is sensitive or reactive. If not managed properly, this can cause irritation, outbreaks, and other undesirable responses.
3-Step Skincare Routine
:
Pros
:
The three-step skincare routine is basic and clear, focusing on the most important steps—cleansing, moisturising, and sunscreen. It's simple to use and ideal for people with busy schedules or those new to skincare.
The three-step process is quick and efficient, making it ideal for those who prefer a minimalist approach or have limited time for skincare.
A three-step programme often requires fewer goods, making it less expensive than a ten-step approach. It enables people to invest in high-quality necessities without overpaying for unnecessary items.
Cons
:
A 3-step programme may not adequately treat specific skincare conditions such as acne, hyperpigmentation, or ageing. Additional goods or treatments may be required to address these difficulties properly.
With fewer goods, there is less room for personalisation based on skin type, problems, or preferences. This may result in inferior outcomes for some people who require more specialised care.
Simplifying skincare to three steps may leave out crucial features such as exfoliation or focused treatments that could improve the skin. In a skincare routine, a balance of simplicity and effectiveness is important
Time and Effort Required
A skincare routine's time and effort requirements vary depending on the goals, lifestyle choices, and personal preferences of the user. The 3-step and 10-step regimens are both potentially beneficial options; the decision between them should be made on which one best suits your skin type and can be easily incorporated into your daily schedule.
Cost Comparison
The number of products used, their price range, and the frequency of replacement all play a role in determining how much a 10-step skincare programme will cost compared to a 3-step routine. To get healthy, glowing skin within your budget, it's critical to prioritise skincare necessities, make high-quality product investments, and modify your routine as necessary.
Choosing the Right Routine for Your Skin
Choosing the best skincare routine for your skin requires careful consideration of various criteria, including your skin type, issues, preferences, lifestyle, and budget. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you choose the most appropriate routine:
Know your skin type
: Determine your skin type: oily, dry, combo, normal, or sensitive. Understanding your skin type will allow you to select products that meet your requirements.
Identify Your Skincare Concerns
: Make a note of any specific issues you want to address, such as acne, ageing, hyperpigmentation, sensitivity, or dehydration. This will influence your product choice and treatment alternatives.
Consider your lifestyle

Evaluate Your Budget
:
Determine your skincare budget and prioritize essential products that deliver the most value for your money. Consider investing in high-quality basics like cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreens while being mindful of any additional treatments or speciality products you may want to incorporate.
Start Simple
: If you're new to skincare or have limited time and money, start with a three-step programme that includes cleansing, moisturising, and sunscreen. Before you add extra products or treatments, make sure you have a good foundation.
Experiment and Adjust
: Skincare is a process of trial and error, so don't be hesitant to try new products and formulations to see what works best for your skin. Pay attention to how your skin reacts to each product, and adapt your routine accordingly.
Seek specialist Advice
: If you're not sure which products or treatments are best for your skin, see a dermatologist or skincare specialist. They may evaluate your skin's needs, prescribe appropriate products, and offer personalised recommendations based on your difficulties.
Listen to your skin
: Pay attention to how your skin appears and feels after applying various products. If you experience discomfort, sensitivity, or other bad effects, stop using the product and switch to a more moderate option.
Be Consistent
:
Consistency is essential for seeing benefits with any skincare practice. To get the best results for your skin, stick to your selected routine and use products on a regular and as-instructed basis.
