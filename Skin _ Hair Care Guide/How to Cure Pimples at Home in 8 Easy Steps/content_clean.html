<p><b></b><span>Managing and treating pimples at home can be an effective approach to improving the state of your skin. In 2019, over 12% of Indians aged 20 to 29 experienced pimples and other acne-related disorders. While anybody can acquire pimples, those with oily skin may be at a higher risk. However, this acne treatment guide will teach you how to treat pimples at home without causing redness or scarring.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is the difference between pimples and acne?<br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="What is the difference between pimples and acne?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_3_-_2023-11-06T125821.793_480x480.png?v=1699255721"/></div>
<p><span>Acne and pimples are two terms that are frequently used interchangeably. However, if you want to treat pimples at home, you must first understand the difference between pimples and acne. Acne is the underlying disorder that causes pimples, in the simplest terms. If you frequently acquire pimples on your face, acne therapy should focus on addressing the underlying cause, whether it's high sebum levels, skin damage, or something else. Pimples and acne are both skin   however, there are some important distinctions between the two:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Isolated lesions, mild to moderate cases, common triggers, and treatment for pimples</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Acne characteristics include chronic conditions, severity, long duration, underlying causes, and treatment.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>What causes pimples?</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="What causes pimples?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/122_0a054474-12ad-43fc-a959-2f9992075c9a_480x480.png?v=1699967080"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Before you can cure pimples at home, it is vital to understand the reasons behind them! After all, you want to know what you are actually treating. Pimples occur when small pores in the skin get clogged with excess sebum (oil) and dead skin cells. The pores then become infected, resulting in pimples. If you are wondering about the name of the bacteria responsible for causing pimples, it is Propionobacterium acnes. If you have oily skin or are frequently exposed to environmental pollutants, the chances of your skin pores getting clogged might be higher. In such a case, following an anti-pimple skincare routine will help you treat and prevent pimples forever. The following are the primary causes of pimples: </span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Sebum Overproduction</b><span>:</span> <span> The skin's sebaceous (oil) glands create sebum, a natural oil that helps keep the skin moisturised. When the sebaceous glands create an excessive amount of sebum, the hair follicles might become clogged.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hair Follicle Clogging</b><span>: Skin cells, sebum, and hair can combine to form a block in hair follicles, preventing natural sebum flow to the skin's surface. This plug produces an environment conducive to bacterial growth.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Bacterial Growth</b><span>: Clogged hair follicles provide an ideal environment for the growth of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), a type of bacteria that is normally present on the skin. In clogged follicles, P. acnes can multiply quickly.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Inflammation</b><span>: When bacteria multiply, the immune system responds with inflammation, resulting in redness, swelling, and pus formation. This inflammatory response is responsible for pimples' distinctive appearance.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hormonal Changes</b><span>: Hormonal changes, particularly during puberty, can cause an increase in sebum production, making adolescents more prone to pimples. Acne can also be caused by menstrual cycle hormonal changes, pregnancy, or medical problems including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Diet and Lifestyle</b><span>: Certain dietary factors, such as the consumption of high-glycemic-index foods and dairy products, can aggravate pimples in some people. Acne can be aggravated by lifestyle factors such as stress and pollution exposure.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Genetics</b><span>: A family history of acne can increase the likelihood of developing pimples. Genetic factors can affect the structure and function of the skin, as well as the body's inflammatory response.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cosmetics and Hair Products</b><span>: The use of pore-clogging cosmetics or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hair-regrow-serum">hair products</a>, especially if they are not properly removed, can contribute to the development of pimples.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>While these factors all contribute to the development of pimples, acne can vary widely from person to person. Some people are genetically predisposed to acne, while others have acne predominantly as a result of hormone fluctuations or other circumstances. Acne management frequently entails addressing several variables and may necessitate a personalised approach, which may include skincare, lifestyle, changes, and, in some circumstances, medication therapies. If you have acne concerns,<a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist"> consult a dermatologist</a> for expert guidance and treatment choices.</span></p>
<h3><b>Are pimples bad for health?</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Are pimples bad for health?" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/120_1b504e9d-0176-4c12-b6e9-845b74fd23b1_480x480.png?v=1699967121"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Pimples are not commonly seen as a major threat to one's general health. They are a common skin condition characterised by clogged hair follicles, excessive oil production, bacterial growth, and irritation. While pimples are not dangerous to your health, they can have a negative impact on your lifestyle and well-being.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Pimples often leave behind long-lasting scars. Acne-related scarring takes time to heal, so it is best to prevent pimples on the face to avoid marks and scars on the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Acne-prone skin will hold back your confidence and self-worth, whether in your personal life or work life.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The frequent occurrence of pimples can indicate underlying skin conditions such as excess sebum production in the skin. You should look for indicators such as pimples and acne as ways to get skin that is overall healthier, cleaner, and fresher.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>While pimples do not pose a direct threat to health, the influence they have on mental and emotional well-being should not be overlooked. It is critical to handle pimples and acne, especially when they impair a person's quality of life. Acne can be managed and improved with proper skincare, lifestyle changes, and, in some circumstances, medication therapies. Consider obtaining advice and treatment from a dermatologist or healthcare expert if your acne is harming your mental or emotional well-being.</span></p>
<h3><b>Hormonal acne vs regular pimples</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Hormonal acne vs regular pimples" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/121_97534b76-0cba-4b5e-af1d-66ad6e9a948c_480x480.png?v=1699967217"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Acne vulgaris and hormonal acne are both kinds of acne, although they differ in their underlying causes, features, and occurrence patterns. The following are the main differences between hormonal acne and ordinary pimples:</span></p>
<h4><b>Hormonal Acne:</b></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Cause</b><span>: Hormonal acne is mostly caused by changes in the body's hormones, specifically androgen hormones like testosterone. Hormonal imbalances can increase sebum (<a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/skin-oil">skin oil</a>) production and alter its composition, making the skin more susceptible to acne.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Location</b><span>: The lower face (chin and jawline), neck, chest, and back are common places for hormonal acne to show up. It is less common on the brow and cheeks.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Pattern</b><span>: Hormonal acne frequently follows a cyclic pattern, with breakouts occurring at specific times during the menstrual cycle in women. It can also occur during pregnancy, menopause, or as a result of conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Lesions</b><span>: Deep, cystic acne lesions that are painful, larger, and more likely to leave scars are common in hormonal acne.  It can also appear as smaller pimples and blackheads.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Age of onset</b><span>: Adolescence and adulthood are possible times when hormonal acne first appears. It affects adult women more frequently.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reaction to Topical Treatments</b><span>: Hormonal acne often responds less well to over-the-counter topicals, prescription medications, such as hormonal therapies like anti-androgens or oral contraceptives, may be required.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><b>Regular Pimples (Acne Vulgaris):</b></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Cause</b><span>: Acne vulgaris, or recurring pimples, can be caused by an overabundance of sebum production, hair follicle blockage, bacterial development (P. acnes), inflammation, and genetic susceptibility.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Location</b><span>: The face, neck, chest, back, and shoulders are all possible places for regular pimples to appear. They do not just affect particular regions, such as hormonal acne.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Pattern</b><span>: Although flare-ups are possible with regular pimples, they do not always follow a cyclical pattern associated with changes in hormone levels.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Types of Lesions</b><span>: A variety of lesions can be associated with regular pimples, such as whiteheads, blackheads, pustules, papules, and, in certain situations, cysts and nodules. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Age of Onset</b><span>: Hormonal changes associated with adolescence are the usual cause of acne vulgaris, although it can strike people at any age.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reaction to Topical Treatments</b><span>: Benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or alpha hydroxy acids are among the ingredients found in many over-the-counter topical treatments that can be used to treat frequent breakouts. In more severe cases, prescription medications may be required.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3><b>Importance of cleanliness in preventing acne</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Importance of cleanliness in preventing acne" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/123_3dd0128f-316a-40f0-bc24-300a0511dae2_480x480.png?v=1699967288"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>The significance of hygiene in acne prevention and skin health cannot be emphasised. Acne is commonly linked to clogged pores, increased oil production, and the growth of acne-causing bacteria. Here are a few reasons why cleanliness is essential for acne prevention:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Excess Oil and Impurities</b><span>: Regular cleansing aids in the removal of excess sebum (skin oil), dirt, and sweat from the skin's surface. When these substances build up, they can <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/open-pores">clog pores</a> and cause acne breakouts.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Unclogging Pores</b><span>: Clean skin is less likely to develop clogged pores, which are a major contributor to pimple formation. Blackheads and whiteheads can form as a result of clogged pores.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Bacterial Control</b><span>: Proper cleansing can help control the population of acne-causing bacteria on the skin's surface, such as Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes).  Reducing bacterial growth can aid in the prevention of inflammatory acne.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Inflammation Prevention</b><span>: Clean skin is less likely to become inflamed. Acne is characterised by inflammation, which causes the redness and swelling associated with pimples.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skincare Product Absorption</b><span>: Clean skin is more receptive to skincare products, allowing them to penetrate the skin more effectively. This can boost the effectiveness of acne treatments and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hydrasoothe-moisturiser">moisturisers</a>.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Secondary Infection Prevention</b><span>: Keeping the skin clean aids in the prevention of secondary infections, which can occur when pimples are picked, squeezed, or broken open.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation Prevention</b><span>: Clean skin is less likely to develop post-inflammatory <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">hyperpigmentation</a>, which are dark spots caused by acne breakouts. By preventing acne, you reduce the risk of scarring and dark marks.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydration Balance</b><span>: Proper cleansing can help to keep the skin's natural hydration balance, which is important for overall skin health.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>To keep your skin clean and prevent acne, you should:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Cleanse your face twice a day (morning and night) with a gentle, non-comedogenic <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-foaming-face-wash">cleanser</a>.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Hot water might be too harsh on the skin, so when cleansing, use lukewarm water.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Excessive cleansing can strip the skin of its natural oils, leading to increased oil production.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>To avoid the transfer of oil and bacteria to the skin, use a clean towel and pillowcase.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Choose non-comedogenic skincare and makeup to avoid pore clogging.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Cleanliness is a crucial facet of acne prevention, but it should be part of a full skincare programme that includes proper products and a healthy lifestyle. If you have acne concerns, see a dermatologist for personalised advice and treatment choices.</span></p>
<h3><b>Role of diet in acne and pimples</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="Role of diet in acne and pimples" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/124_4a35ee7c-8479-41bb-91b0-459fd3cc40b8_480x480.png?v=1699967326"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Some people's diets can influence the development and control of acne and pimples. Diet and acne have a complicated relationship, and not all persons are equally influenced by dietary factors. Certain dietary choices and behaviors, however, have been linked to acne and may play a role in its development. Here are some essential points about nutrition and acne:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>High-Glycemic Foods</b><span>: High-glycemic-index foods and refined carbs (e.g., white bread, sugary snacks, and sugary beverages) may raise blood sugar levels and activate insulin production. High insulin levels can cause an increase in sebum (skin oil), inflammation, and the growth of acne-causing bacteria, all of which contribute to the formation of pimples.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Dairy Products</b><span>: Some research has suggested that dairy consumption, particularly skim milk, may increase the incidence of acne. Hormones and growth factors included in dairy products are known to have an impact on skin health. The precise mechanisms and effects of dairy on acne can differ from person to person.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Fatty and trans fats</b><span>: A diet high in saturated and trans fats, which are commonly found in fried and fast foods, may promote inflammation in the body, exacerbating acne.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Omega-6 Fatty Acids</b><span>: A high intake of omega-6 fatty acids, which are commonly found in vegetable oils, can aggravate inflammation. It is essential to balance omega-6 fatty acid consumption with omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory characteristics, for overall skin health.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Food Sensitivities and Allergies</b><span>: Some people may experience acne flare-ups as a result of food allergies or sensitivities. Gluten, dairy, and certain additives or preservatives are common culprits.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Antioxidants and Anti-Inflammatory Foods</b><span>: Fruits and vegetables, which are high in <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/antioxidants">antioxidants</a>, may help reduce inflammation and support general skin health. Anti-inflammatory foods, such as fatty fish (high in omega-3 fatty acids), may also aid skin health.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydration</b><span>:</span> <span>Staying hydrated is essential for overall skin health. Dehydrated skin may produce extra oil to compensate, which may result in acne.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It's essential to remember that everyone's reactions to nutrition differ, and not everyone gets acne or pimples as a result of their eating habits. Acne is also influenced by genetics, hormonal factors, and skincare habits. If you feel that your diet is contributing to your acne, make gradual dietary modifications and monitor how your skin reacts. A dermatologist or other healthcare professional can provide personalised advice on how to treat acne and its associated dietary factors. Maintaining a balanced and healthy diet rich in nutrients and antioxidants can also help with general skin health.</span></p>

<h3><b>#1 Apply ice on your pimples</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="#1 Apply ice on your pimples" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/125_3b9cd26d-4ac4-40ae-88df-4142b3b061c9_480x480.png?v=1699967483"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Applying ice to a pimple can be an effective home cure for reducing inflammation, redness, and swelling. Ice cubes are a simple and effective home remedy for acne. If you choose not to use pimple medications, icing your pimples is an efficient method of treating acne. Ice's cooling and moisturising properties will minimise skin irritation surrounding your pimple without leaving any scars.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Wrap some ice cubes in a plastic bag.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Apply it over the acne-affected area and press gently for 3-4 minutes.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Repeat these steps as many times a day as possible. It is the easiest way to cure pimples naturally and safely.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>By lowering the size and redness of a pimple, using ice as a spot treatment can provide temporary relief. While this treatment may be useful in the short term, it may not address the underlying reasons for acne, such as increased oil production, plugged pores, and bacterial growth. Consider combining a full skincare routine with lifestyle changes to properly treat acne. If you have persistent or severe acne, you should see a dermatologist for professional advice and treatment options.</span></p>
<h3><b>#2 Use a paste of crushed aspirin</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="#2 Use a paste of crushed aspirin" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/126_0914f17e-74dd-4aa8-8d18-29e411328475_480x480.png?v=1699967513"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Since salicylic acid, a common ingredient in many over-the-counter acne treatments, is present in aspirin, using a paste of crushed aspirin can be a useful home remedy for pimples.  Aspirin tablets can be found in almost every home or in most over-the-counter pharmacy shops. But not many people know that it contains Salicylic acid, which is a magic acne-fighter that can help you get rid of pimples. Here's how:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Crush a tablet of Aspirin with a spoon.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Add a few drops of water to the powder to form a thick paste.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Apply the paste to the pimples or acne-affected area.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Using Aspirin tablets for their Salicylic acid content is one of the best home remedies for pimples. In fact, many skin creams for acne use Salicylic acid to cure and prevent pimples on the face forever. Sesderma Acnises Young Roll-On Focal is an easy-to-use cosmeceutical in India designed to help you get rid of pimples forever. If you have persistent or severe acne, or if you are unsure about using aspirin as a treatment, you should seek expert advice and treatment alternatives from a dermatologist. Maintaining a comprehensive skincare routine and leading a healthy lifestyle can also help with acne management.</span></p>
<h3><b>#3 Apply apple cider vinegar</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="#3 Apply apple cider vinegar" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/127_ed27d813-dcaa-409b-82f7-2525dc024977_480x480.png?v=1699967543"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a popular home remedy that some people use for a variety of reasons, including acne and pimple treatment. Using apple cider vinegar to cure pimples at home is not a new remedy. It is considered one of the best ways to cure pimples naturally because it is made by fermenting the juice from pressed apples. ACV has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, and it contains organic acids that may help exfoliate the skin. However, it's important to use ACV with caution, as it can be potent and may not be suitable for all skin types. Here's how to use it:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Dilute the ACV</b><span>: Combine one part apple cider vinegar with three parts water. This dilution is necessary to avoid skin irritation because undiluted ACV can be harsh on the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Test a Small Area</b><span>: Perform a patch test on a small, inconspicuous area of your skin before applying the diluted ACV to your face. This helps to ensure that you do not have a negative reaction.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Application</b><span>: Apply the diluted ACV to the pimple or the affected area with a clean cotton ball or pad. Avoid applying it all over your face because it can be drying.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Allow It To Dry</b><span>: Allow the ACV to dry on your skin for 10-20 minutes.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Rinse Off: Use lukewarm water to rinse your skin once it has dried.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Moisturise</b><span>: To prevent over-drying, use a gentle, non-comedogenic moisturiser on your skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Frequency</b><span>: Apply this therapy infrequently. It may cause skin irritation, so try it no more than a couple of times per week.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Despite being a popular home remedy for pimples, it can cause skin irritation and burning in some people. If this happens, it’s best to discontinue using apple cider vinegar on your skin for acne. While some people with acne may find relief with ACV, not everyone will benefit from it, and it should not be used in place of a thorough skincare regimen. It is best to seek professional advice and treatment options from a dermatologist if you have severe or persistent acne, or if you are unsure whether to use ACV as a treatment.</span></p>
<h3><b>#4 Use green tea extracts</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="#4 Use green tea extracts" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/128_157fcc6f-9d60-4395-b063-e7e1e243822d_480x480.png?v=1699967580"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Green tea has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is also rich in epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which has been proven to cure and prevent pimples. Green tea may help reduce inflammation, control oil production, and inhibit the growth of acne-causing bacteria. While drinking green tea regularly will help, many people also apply it topically to get rid of pimples on the face forever. You can use green tea for acne in a few simple steps:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Remove a small amount of green tea leaves from the tea bags.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Soak them in warm water and add honey or aloe vera gel.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Apply the mix to the acne-affected area.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Leave it on for 10 to 20 minutes before peeling off the mask.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>As with any new skincare product or cure, a patch test is required to ensure that you do not have an unpleasant reaction. If you notice any irritation, stop using the product and immediately rinse your skin. If you have persistent or severe acne, you should see a dermatologist for professional advice and treatment options.</span></p>
<h3><b>#5 Use an acne spot treatment cream for pimples</b></h3>

</div>
<p><span>Taking the dermatology route often works when nothing else does!</span></p>
<p><span>Acne spot treatment creams utilise modern formulations that are tried and tested to work against pimples and acne. By combining the healing effects of natural extracts with Salicylic acid, Benzoyl peroxide, and other anti-acne formulas, acne spot reduction creams heal your skin from deep within. And the best part - your pimples aren’t going to leave behind any scars or marks. These creams typically contain active ingredients that aid in the reduction of inflammation, the unclogging of pores, and the killing of acne-causing bacteria.  Here's how to apply a pimple spot treatment cream:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Cleanse Your Face</b><span>: Always begin with a clean face. Wash your face gently with a non-comedogenic cleanser and pat it dry with a clean towel.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Apply the Spot Treatment</b><span>: Apply a small amount of the acne spot treatment cream directly to the pimple with a clean fingertip or cotton swab. Make sure to cover the pimple but avoid applying it to the surrounding skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Follow Product Instructions</b><span>: Different acne spot treatments contain various active ingredients, so it's important to follow the specific product's instructions. Benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulphur, and alpha hydroxy acids are all common active ingredients in spot treatments. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Allow It to Dry</b><span>: Allow the spot treatment cream to dry on your skin. This could take some time.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Moisturise (Optional)</b><span>: If the spot treatment cream causes your skin to feel dry, apply a gentle, non-comedogenic moisturiser to the rest of your face.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Frequency</b><span>: Apply the spot treatment cream as often as possible throughout the day, following the directions on the product label. It is imperative that the cream not be overused, as this may irritate the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Be patient</b><span>: Spot treatments may not work immediately, and noticeable results may take a few days or more. Maintain consistency in your application.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>It is important to note that not all spot treatment creams work the same way for everyone, as reactions can vary. If you have sensitive or allergic skin, it is critical to conduct a patch test before using a new product to ensure that it will not cause an allergic reaction. Furthermore, while spot treatment creams can be effective for treating individual pimples, they may not address the underlying causes of acne, such as excess oil production and clogged pores. If you have persistent or severe acne, you should see a dermatologist for professional advice and treatment options.</span></p>
<h3><b>#6 Hydrate your skin with Hyaluronic acid</b></h3>

<p><span><img alt="#6 Hydrate your skin with Hyaluronic acid" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/129_9ac1d5ec-d48e-43a1-bec1-1a242d353b85_480x480.png?v=1699967613"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hyaluronic-skinbooster-serum">Hyaluronic acid</a> is one of the most powerful hydrating agents for your skin. It locks moisture into the skin to regulate levels of sebum that are responsible for causing acne. Many serums and skin creams for pimples contain Hyaluronic acid. If you frequently get pimples on your skin, Dermatica HA Pure Serum is a popular acne treatment that uses Hyaluronic acid as the active ingredient. Here's how you can use hyaluronic acid to keep your skin hydrated:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Select a Hyaluronic Acid Product</b><span>: Hyaluronic acid can be found in a variety of skincare products, including serums, moisturisers, and creams. Choose a product that is appropriate for your skin type and preferences.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cleanse Your Face</b><span>: Always start with a clean face.  Wash your face gently with a non-comedogenic cleanser, then pat dry with a fresh towel.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Apply Hyaluronic Acid</b><span>: Apply the hyaluronic acid serum or moisturiser on your face according to the product instructions. Typically, a minimal amount should be used and evenly distributed.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Wait for Absorption:</b><span> Allow the hyaluronic acid product to absorb into your skin, which may take a few minutes.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Follow with moisturiser (If Needed): </b><span>Depending on your skin type, you may wish to use a moisturiser afterward. A moisturiser can aid in the retention of hyaluronic acid and provide additional hydration.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sunscreen (Daytime)</b><span>: If you use hyaluronic acid in the morning, follow it up with a broad-spectrum <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-sunprotect-sunscreen-spf-50">sunscreen</a> to protect your skin from UV damage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Frequency</b><span>: Hyaluronic acid can be used as part of your daily skincare routine in the morning and evening.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>You can attain plumper, smoother, and more moisturised skin by including it in your skincare routine. It is especially good for people who have dry or dehydrated skin. While hyaluronic acid can provide the necessary moisture, it may not address other skincare conditions such as acne, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-skin-renewer-retinol-serum">fine wrinkles</a>, or hyperpigmentation. If you have specific skin concerns, consider utilising products designed to address those issues or meeting with a physician for personalised skincare advice.</span></p>
<h3><b>#7 Use a face mask to prevent acne</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="#7 Use a face mask to prevent acne" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/105_134749c4-da0e-4096-9fe1-b762f9b90a6a_480x480.png?v=1699958457"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Because pimples are caused by clogged skin pores, dust and pollution from the outside can cause or aggravate the problem. Face masks come in a variety of styles, and the one you choose should be based on your skin type and specific skincare needs. Face masks for acne exfoliate and wash your face gently, assisting it in removing pollutants that may be obstructing your skin pores. Thus, utilising face masks once every 1 or 2 months can be useful if you want to avoid pimples on your face forever. Here's how to use a face mask to fight acne:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Select the Right Face Mask</b><span>: Select a face mask that is appropriate for your skin type and issues. Consider a mask containing clay, salicylic acid, sulphur, or charcoal for acne prevention. These substances can aid in the regulation of excess oil and the unclogging of pores. To keep your skin hydrated, use hydrating masks containing substances like hyaluronic acid.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cleanse Your Face</b><span>: Begin with a clean face.  To remove makeup, dirt, and excess oil, use a mild cleanser.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Apply the Face Mask</b><span>: Apply the face mask evenly to your face, avoiding the <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-ultra-heal-under-eye-cream">eye area </a>and lips, according to the package recommendations. Use a brush or your fingertips to apply the product as directed.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Leave It On</b><span>:</span> <span>Allow the mask to sit on your skin for the period provided in the product directions. This usually takes between 10 and 20 minutes, but it can vary.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Rinse Off</b><span>: Rinse the face mask with lukewarm water to ensure that all traces of the product are eliminated.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Moisturise (if necessary)</b><span>: Apply a non-comedogenic moisturiser to lock in moisture, depending on your skin type.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Frequency</b><span>: The frequency with which you use face masks will vary depending on the product and the needs of your skin. Using a mask once or twice a week is usually enough.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sunscreen (during the day)</b><span>: If you use a face mask in the morning, make sure to follow it up with a broad-spectrum sunscreen to protect your skin from UV damage.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Furthermore, face masks are only one part of a holistic skincare regimen. You may also want to explore a daily skincare routine that includes washing, moisturising, and the use of specialist acne-fighting products as needed for acne prevention and treatment. If you have persistent or severe acne, you should see a dermatologist for professional advice and treatment options.</span></p>

<h3><b>How to avoid pimple scars</b></h3>
<div>
<p><span><img alt="How to avoid pimple scars" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/131_f9c0cdf6-9108-4ca5-aeb0-98c91f74d70c_480x480.png?v=1699967681"/></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Acne management and gentle skincare practises are the first steps in preventing pimple scars. Here are some pointers to avoid pimple scars:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Early Treatment</b><span>: To reduce the risk of scarring, treat acne as soon as it appears. If you have a tendency to scar easily, seek professional advice and treatment from a dermatologist.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hands Off</b><span>: To prevent scarring and to worsen inflammation, refrain from popping, squeezing, or picking at pimples. Allow pimples to heal naturally.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Gentle Cleansing</b><span>: To avoid further skin irritation, use a mild, non-comedogenic cleanser and wash your face gently.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Sun Protection</b><span>: Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen on a daily basis to protect your skin from UV rays. Sun exposure can darken and make existing scars more visible.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid Harsh Scrubs</b><span>: Harsh exfoliants and abrasive scrubs can aggravate inflammation and potentially harm the skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hydration</b><span>: Use a non-comedogenic moisturiser to keep your skin hydrated. Scarring is less likely in hydrated skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Treatment for Early Hyperpigmentation</b><span>: If you notice dark spots (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation) after a pimple heals, use products containing <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-nia-serum">niacinamide</a> or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-vitamin-c3-serum">vitamin C </a>to help fade these marks.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid Using Harsh Acne Treatments</b><span>: Certain acne treatments, such as strong chemical peels or aggressive extractions, can cause scarring.  Consult a dermatologist about treatment options to ensure the best approach for your skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Limit Sun Exposure</b><span>: Prolonged sun exposure can cause scars to darken. Wear protective clothing and apply sunscreen if you must be outside in the sun.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Professional Care</b><span>: If you have severe or cystic acne, or if you are prone to scarring, see a dermatologist as soon as possible. They can provide customised treatments and advice to help reduce scarring.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Topical Treatments</b><span>: If you have a history of acne scarring, use products containing retinoids, alpha hydroxy acids (<a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/aha-bha-range">AHAs</a>), or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) to promote skin cell turnover and reduce the appearance of scars. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Microneedling and Laser Therapy</b><span>: Dermatological procedures such as microneedling and laser therapy can be used to improve the appearance of acne scars in some cases.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Although not all scars can be completely avoided, early intervention and proper skincare can significantly reduce the risk and improve the appearance of existing scars. If you are concerned about acne scars, see a dermatologist for the best treatment options for your skin.</span></p>
