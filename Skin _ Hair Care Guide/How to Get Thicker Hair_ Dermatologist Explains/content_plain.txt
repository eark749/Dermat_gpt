Several factors can contribute to thinning hair, including genetics, aging, hormonal changes, and poor nutrition. In this blog we will discuss simple steps you can take to help strengthen thickness of hair naturally and some hair thickening treatment including what to look for choosing the best thickening hair shampoo and conditioners.
Causes of hair thinning
Hair thinning can have a variety of causes, including:
Genetics
: The most common cause of hair thinning is genetics, also known as pattern baldness or
androgenetic alopecia
. This is a hereditary condition that affects both men and women.
Hormonal changes
: Hormonal changes can also lead to hair thinning, such as changes that occur during
pregnancy
, menopause, or thyroid disorders.
Nutritional deficiencies
: A lack of nutrients, such as
iron
, zinc, or
biotin
, can lead to hair thinning.
Stress
: High levels of stress can cause hair loss, as stress can interrupt the hair growth cycle.
Medications
: Certain medications, such as chemotherapy drugs, blood thinners, and antidepressants, can cause hair thinning.
Medical conditions
: Certain medical conditions, such as autoimmune diseases, scalp infections, and
alopecia areata
, can cause hair thinning.
Hairstyles and treatments
: Certain hairstyles and hair treatments, such as tight braids, weaves, and chemical treatments, can damage the hair and lead to hair thinning.
If you are experiencing hair thinning, it is important to
see a healthcare professional or a
dermatologist
to determine the underlying cause and the best course of treatment.
Symptoms of hair thinning
Hair thinning can manifest in several ways and may have different symptoms for different people. Here are some common symptoms of hair thinning:
Gradual reduction in hair volume
: One of the most common symptoms of hair thinning is a gradual reduction in hair volume over time. You may notice that your hair appears thinner, with less fullness and body.
More hair shedding
: You may notice increased hair shedding in the shower, on your pillow, or when you brush or comb your hair.
Receding hairline
: Hair thinning may cause your hairline to recede, especially in men.
Bald patches
: Some people with hair thinning may develop
bald patches
on the scalp
.
Thinning of hair on the top of the head
: Women may notice a widening of the part or a reduction in hair volume on the top of the head.
Visible scalp
: Hair thinning may make your scalp more visible, especially when your hair is wet or styled in certain ways.
Change in hair texture
: You may notice a change in your hair texture, such as it becoming more fine or brittle.
If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, you should speak with a healthcare professional or dermatologist to determine the cause and explore treatment options.
Identifying common triggers for hair loss
Hair loss can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic and environmental. Here are some common triggers:
Genetics
: Family history is a significant factor in hair loss. Androgenetic alopecia, also known as male or female pattern baldness, is the most common type of hair loss and is often hereditary.
Hormonal Changes
: Pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, and thyroid disorders can all result in temporary or permanent hair loss.
Stress
: Physical or emotional stress can cause telogen effluvium, a type of hair loss in which hair enters the resting phase of the hair growth cycle before falling out more easily.
Medical Conditions
: Alopecia areata (an autoimmune disease that causes patchy hair loss), scalp infections, and underlying health issues such as lupus or diabetes can all contribute to hair loss.
Medications
: Certain medications, particularly those used to treat cancer, arthritis, depression, heart problems, and high blood pressure, can cause hair loss as a side effect.
Nutritional Deficiencies
: Inadequate intake of essential nutrients like iron, protein, vitamins (particularly vitamin D and B vitamins), and minerals can cause hair thinning and loss.
Poor Hair Care Habits
: Excessive styling, frequent use of heating tools, tight hairstyles (such as ponytails or braids), and harsh chemical treatments can damage the hair shaft, causing breakage and hair loss.
Age
: As people age, the rate of hair growth slows and hair follicles shrink, resulting in thinner and finer hair.
Environmental Factors
: Pollutants, UV radiation, and harsh weather can all harm the hair and scalp, leading to hair loss.
Hair thickening treatment
There are several hair thickening treatments available that can help improve the thickness and overall health of your hair. Here are a few options:
Topical treatments
: There are several topical treatments available that can help
stimulate
hair growth
and improve hair thickness. These include products containing minoxidil, which is a medication that has been approved by the FDA to treat hair loss.
Hair supplements
: There are several supplements available that can help improve
hair thickness
and overall health. Some popular options include biotin, vitamin D, and iron.
Haircare products
: Using hair care products that are designed to add volume and thickness to your hair can also help. Look for shampoos and conditioners that contain ingredients like
keratin
, collagen, and biotin.
Hair transplant
: In some cases, a hair transplant may be an option for people with thinning hair. During a hair transplant, hair follicles are taken from a donor site on the scalp and transplanted to the thinning or balding areas.
Lifestyle changes
: Making certain lifestyle changes can also help improve the health and thickness of your hair. For example, eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and reducing stress can all help improve the overall health of your hair.
Hair thickening shampoo
These six techniques can help you grow hair that is thicker, healthier, and more attractive, with noticeable results in a month or less.
The shampoo and conditioner you use can have a significant impact on the thickness, strength, and overall appearance of your hair.
Shampoo
removes sebum, a type of oil secreted by your skin. Regularly washing your hair with shampoo also lowers your chances of developing
seborrheic dermatitis
, a common scalp condition that causes itchy, inflamed skin. Wash your hair when it feels oily to keep it looking its best. This could mean every day if you have oily hair, or much less frequently if your scalp is dry. After each shampoo, condition your hair thoroughly.
Conditioner
strengthens your hair and improves its appearance, giving it a thicker appearance.
Apply conditioner to the ends of your hair, which are often the first to become dull and thin. Avoiding over-conditioning your scalp can also help keep your hair from looking weighed down. Choose hair care products that prevent hair shedding for the best results. Our Shampoo and Conditioner are specifically designed to reduce shedding and keep your hair looking soft and full.
Latest advancements in topical treatments
Topical treatments for hair loss have advanced significantly, particularly in terms of research and development. While some treatments have been around for a while, ongoing research is helping to improve their efficacy and explore new options. Here are some noteworthy advancements:
Topical Finasteride
: Finasteride is an oral medication used to treat male pattern baldness. Recently, topical finasteride formulations have been developed to reduce systemic side effects while maintaining efficacy. These formulations deliver the medication directly to the scalp, targeting the hair follicles and lowering the risk of systemic absorption.
Topical Minoxidil Enhancements
: Minoxidil is a popular topical treatment for hair loss that can be purchased over the counter. Recent developments include enhanced formulations that improve absorption, efficacy, and user experience. These enhancements could include new delivery systems, such as foam or sprays, as well as the addition of ingredients to improve efficacy or reduce side effects.
Peptide-based Treatments
: Peptides are short amino acid chains with a variety of biological effects, including stimulating hair growth. Researchers are looking into peptide-based topical treatments for hair loss, specifically their ability to promote hair growth and improve hair follicle function.
Stem Cell Therapies
: Stem cell therapy shows promise for regenerating hair follicles and stimulating hair growth. While much of the research focuses on injectable treatments, there is ongoing interest in topical formulations containing stem cell-derived factors or exosomes, which may stimulate hair follicle activity and promote hair growth.
Nutraceuticals and Botanicals
: Some topical treatments contain natural ingredients, such as botanical extracts and nutraceuticals, which are known to promote hair health. These formulations frequently include vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and plant-based compounds to nourish the scalp, improve circulation, and promote healthy hair growth.
Microneedling with Topicals
:
Microneedling
is the process of creating tiny punctures in the scalp to stimulate collagen production and improve topical treatment absorption. Combining microneedling with topical formulations like minoxidil or peptide-based solutions may boost their efficacy by increasing penetration and promoting hair follicle regeneration.
Benefits of minoxidil and other growth serums
Minoxidil and other growth serums can provide several benefits to people who are experiencing hair loss or want to improve their hair density and thickness. Here are some of the key benefits:
Minoxidil, the active ingredient in many growth serums, stimulates the growth phase of hair follicles (anagen), resulting in increased hair density and thickness over time. It can also extend the duration of the anagen phase, resulting in stronger hair growth.
Minoxidil is FDA-approved to treat androgenetic alopecia (male or female pattern baldness), the most common type of hair loss. It works for both men and women, slowing down hair loss and promoting regrowth in affected areas.
Minoxidil and other growth serums are usually applied topically to the scalp, making them simple to use and integrate into a daily hair care regimen. They are available in a variety of formulations, including solutions, foams, and sprays, allowing users to select the best application method for their needs.
Unlike surgical hair restoration procedures such as hair transplantation, minoxidil and growth serums offer a non-invasive solution to hair loss. They do not require surgery or recovery time, and the majority of people tolerate them well.
While minoxidil is primarily used to treat androgenetic alopecia, it may also benefit people with other types of hair loss, such as telogen effluvium or alopecia areata, by stimulating hair regrowth and improving overall hair health.
Minoxidil and growth serums can be combined with other hair loss treatments, such as oral medications (e.g.,
finasteride
), low-level laser therapy, or hair transplant procedures, to improve outcomes and address multiple aspects of hair loss at once.
Minoxidil and certain growth serums may improve hair quality by increasing thickness, strength, and resilience. This can result in a fuller, healthier-looking appearance and may help reduce the visibility of thinning areas.
Many minoxidil-based products and growth serums are available over the counter without a prescription, making them accessible to a wide range of people who want to address hair loss.
It is important to note that individual responses to minoxidil and other growth serums can differ, and results may take several months to appear. Furthermore, the benefits of these treatments are typically maintained only through consistent and long-term use. Consulting with a healthcare professional or dermatologist can provide personalised advice on the best treatment approach based on your specific needs and preferences.
Home remedies for hair thickness
While home remedies may not be as effective as clinically proven treatments, they can still help with hair thickness and overall health. Here are some home remedies that can help promote thicker hair:
Scalp Massage
: Massaging the scalp increases blood flow to the hair follicles, which promotes hair growth and thickness. Use your fingertips to gently massage your scalp in circular motions for a few minutes every day.
Essential Oils
: Some essential oils, including rosemary oil, peppermint oil, and lavender oil, are thought to promote hair growth and thickness. Massage a few drops of essential oil into the scalp after diluting it with a carrier oil (such as coconut oil or jojoba oil). Let it sit for at least 30 minutes before shampooing.
Aloe Vera
:
Aloe vera
has calming and moisturising qualities that can strengthen the scalp and encourage hair growth. After directly applying pure aloe vera gel to the scalp and hair and letting it sit for approximately half an hour, wash it off with warm water.
Egg Mask
: Protein, which is abundant in eggs, is necessary for strong hair development. Beat a single or double egg, then smear the mixture onto damp hair. After leaving it on for about twenty minutes, rinse it off using cool water and your regular shampoo.
Onion Juice
:
Onion juice
contains sulfur, which is known to improve hair thickness and stimulate hair growth. Process the onion, extract the juice, and dab the scalp. Before shampooing, leave it on for fifteen to thirty minutes.
Green Tea Rinse
: Packed with antioxidants, green tea helps fortify hair follicles and encourage the growth of new hair. Make a pot of green tea, allow it to cool, and use it as a last rinse after shampooing.
Healthy Diet
: For healthy hair growth, a diet high in protein, vitamins, and minerals should be balanced. To promote hair thickness from the inside out, include foods like eggs, fish, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in your diet.
Avert Heat Styling
: Overuse of heat styling can cause thinning hair by damaging the hair shaft. Reduce the amount of time you spend using hot styling tools like curling irons, straighteners, and hair dryers. Instead, try using heat-free styling techniques whenever you can.
Protective Hairstyles
: Steer clear of tight haircuts that strain the hair because they may result in thinning and breakage. Rather, choose less tight hairstyles to reduce stress on the hair follicles.
Although using these at-home treatments can enhance hair health and thickness, it is important to use them gradually and consistently. It is best to speak with a dermatologist or other healthcare provider if you are significantly losing or thinning hair to receive individualised advice and treatment options.
What ingredients should I look for to promote hair thickness?
There are several ingredients that are believed to promote hair thickness, including:
Biotin
: Also known as Vitamin H, biotin is a B vitamin that is essential for hair growth and overall hair health. Biotin helps to strengthen hair and can help promote hair thickness.
Collagen
:
Collagen
is a protein that is essential for healthy hair growth. It helps to strengthen hair, improve hair elasticity, and promote hair thickness.
Niacin
: Niacin, also known as Vitamin B3, is another B vitamin that can help promote hair thickness. It improves blood flow to the scalp, which helps to nourish hair follicles and promote healthy hair growth.
Zinc
:
Zinc
is a mineral that is important for healthy hair growth. It helps to promote cell growth and repair, which can lead to thicker, healthier hair.
Iron
: Iron is essential for healthy hair growth, as it helps to transport oxygen to hair follicles. Iron deficiency can lead to hair loss and thinning, so ensuring you get enough iron in your diet is important.
Vitamin D
: Vitamin D is important for healthy hair growth, as it helps to regulate hair follicle cycling. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to hair loss and thinning, so getting enough Vitamin D is important.
Omega-3 fatty acids
:
Omega-3 fatty acids
are essential for overall hair health, as they help to keep hair strong and hydrated. They can also help to reduce inflammation, which can lead to healthier hair growth.
It's important to note that while these ingredients may help promote hair thickness, they should be used as part of a comprehensive approach to hair care, which includes a healthy diet, proper hair care, and reducing stress. It's also a good idea to talk to a doctor or dermatologist if you're experiencing hair thinning or hair loss, as they can help identify the underlying cause and recommend the best course of treatment.
Effective natural oils for hair strengthening
Several natural oils can strengthen and nourish the hair, improving overall health and reducing breakage. Here are some useful natural oils for hair strengthening:

: Rosemary oil has antibacterial qualities and increases blood flow to the scalp, which strengthens and encourages the growth of hair follicles. It can help improve hair thickness and reduce hair loss if used regularly.
To use these oils for hair strengthening, apply them directly to the scalp and hair, massage gently, and leave them on for at least 30 minutes overnight before shampooing normally. You can also combine them with other ingredients, such as essential oils or natural hair masks, to gain additional benefits.
Innovative treatments and their impact on hair health
Innovative hair health treatments have advanced significantly in recent years, offering promising solutions to a variety of hair concerns. Here are some innovative treatments and how they affect hair health:
Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy involves injecting platelet-rich plasma from the patient's blood into the scalp to promote hair growth. Platelets contain growth factors that stimulate tissue regeneration and hair follicle activity.
PRP therapy
has shown promise in terms of improving hair density, thickness, and overall hair health, particularly in people suffering from androgenetic alopecia and other forms of hair loss.
Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT), also known as red light therapy or cold laser therapy, involves exposing the scalp to low-level laser light to promote hair growth and health. LLLT is thought to improve blood flow to the scalp, reduce inflammation, and extend the hair growth phase (anagen phase). It is effective in promoting hair regrowth and reducing hair loss in people with different types of alopecia.
Microneedling, also known as collagen induction therapy, is the use of a device with fine needles to create micro-injuries in the scalp, which stimulates collagen production and increases topical treatment absorption. Microneedling can improve scalp health, increase hair follicle function, and stimulate hair growth. When combined with topical treatments like minoxidil or growth factors, microneedling can boost their effectiveness in improving hair health.
Stem cell therapy involves injecting stem cells or stem cell-derived factors into the scalp to regenerate hair follicles and stimulate hair growth. Stem cells can differentiate into a variety of cell types, including hair follicle cells, and aid in tissue repair and regeneration. While still in its early stages of development, stem cell therapy shows promise for treating hair loss and improving overall hair health.
Exosomes are extracellular vesicles containing growth factors, cytokines, and other signalling molecules that aid in cell communication and tissue regeneration. Exosome therapy involves injecting exosomes derived from stem cells or other sources into the scalp to promote hair growth and improve hair health. Exosomes have shown potential in stimulating hair follicle activity, reducing inflammation, and enhancing the effectiveness of other hair loss treatments.
With advancements in technology and personalised medicine, there has been an increase in customised hair care products that are tailored to individual needs and concerns. These products may include customised shampoos, conditioners, and topical treatments formulated with specific ingredients to treat hair loss, thinning, or damage. Customised hair care products can help to improve hair health by addressing underlying issues and offering tailored solutions.
How much time does it take to thicken hair?
The time it takes to thicken hair depends on several factors, including the cause of thinning, the severity of the condition, and the treatment being used. It's important to note that hair thickness and growth rate are largely determined by genetics, so while certain treatments can help improve the appearance of thinning hair, they may not necessarily result in significant hair thickening.
In general, it can take several months to see any significant changes in hair thickness, as hair grows at an average rate of about 0.5 inches (1.25 cm) per month. With consistent use of hair-thickening treatments, such as topical minoxidil or dietary supplements like biotin and iron, some people may notice a gradual improvement in hair thickness over the course of six months to a year. However, it's important to talk to a healthcare professional or a dermatologist to determine the underlying cause of thinning hair and the most appropriate treatment plan.
Quick daily hair care tips for thicker strands
Here are some quick daily hair care tips to encourage thicker strands:
Gentle Washing
: Use a mild shampoo and lukewarm water to wash your hair. Avoid using hot water because it can strip the hair of its natural oils, causing dryness and breakage.
Condition regularly
: After shampooing, use a conditioner that is appropriate for your hair type to moisturise and strengthen the hair. To avoid weighing down the roots, apply conditioner to the mid-lengths and ends of your hair rather than the scalp.
