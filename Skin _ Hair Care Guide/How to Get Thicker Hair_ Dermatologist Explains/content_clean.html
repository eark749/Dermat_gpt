<h3><b>Latest advancements in topical treatments</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Latest advancements in topical treatments" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Latest_advancements_in_topical_treatments_480x480.jpg?v=1722258244"/></div>
<p><span>Topical treatments for hair loss have advanced significantly, particularly in terms of research and development. While some treatments have been around for a while, ongoing research is helping to improve their efficacy and explore new options. Here are some noteworthy advancements:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Topical Finasteride</b><span>: Finasteride is an oral medication used to treat male pattern baldness. Recently, topical finasteride formulations have been developed to reduce systemic side effects while maintaining efficacy. These formulations deliver the medication directly to the scalp, targeting the hair follicles and lowering the risk of systemic absorption.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Topical Minoxidil Enhancements</b><span>: Minoxidil is a popular topical treatment for hair loss that can be purchased over the counter. Recent developments include enhanced formulations that improve absorption, efficacy, and user experience. These enhancements could include new delivery systems, such as foam or sprays, as well as the addition of ingredients to improve efficacy or reduce side effects.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Peptide-based Treatments</b><span>: Peptides are short amino acid chains with a variety of biological effects, including stimulating hair growth. Researchers are looking into peptide-based topical treatments for hair loss, specifically their ability to promote hair growth and improve hair follicle function.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Stem Cell Therapies</b><span>: Stem cell therapy shows promise for regenerating hair follicles and stimulating hair growth. While much of the research focuses on injectable treatments, there is ongoing interest in topical formulations containing stem cell-derived factors or exosomes, which may stimulate hair follicle activity and promote hair growth.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Nutraceuticals and Botanicals</b><span>: Some topical treatments contain natural ingredients, such as botanical extracts and nutraceuticals, which are known to promote hair health. These formulations frequently include vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and plant-based compounds to nourish the scalp, improve circulation, and promote healthy hair growth.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Microneedling with Topicals</b><span>: <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/microneedling-treatment-elevate-your-skin-care">Microneedling</a> is the process of creating tiny punctures in the scalp to stimulate collagen production and improve topical treatment absorption. Combining microneedling with topical formulations like minoxidil or peptide-based solutions may boost their efficacy by increasing penetration and promoting hair follicle regeneration.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Benefits of minoxidil and other growth serums</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Benefits of minoxidil and other growth serums" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Benefits_of_minoxidil_and_other_growth_serums_480x480.jpg?v=1722258267"/></div>
<p><span>Minoxidil and other growth serums can provide several benefits to people who are experiencing hair loss or want to improve their hair density and thickness. Here are some of the key benefits:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Minoxidil, the active ingredient in many growth serums, stimulates the growth phase of hair follicles (anagen), resulting in increased hair density and thickness over time. It can also extend the duration of the anagen phase, resulting in stronger hair growth.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Minoxidil is FDA-approved to treat androgenetic alopecia (male or female pattern baldness), the most common type of hair loss. It works for both men and women, slowing down hair loss and promoting regrowth in affected areas.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Minoxidil and other growth serums are usually applied topically to the scalp, making them simple to use and integrate into a daily hair care regimen. They are available in a variety of formulations, including solutions, foams, and sprays, allowing users to select the best application method for their needs.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Unlike surgical hair restoration procedures such as hair transplantation, minoxidil and growth serums offer a non-invasive solution to hair loss. They do not require surgery or recovery time, and the majority of people tolerate them well.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>While minoxidil is primarily used to treat androgenetic alopecia, it may also benefit people with other types of hair loss, such as telogen effluvium or alopecia areata, by stimulating hair regrowth and improving overall hair health.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Minoxidil and growth serums can be combined with other hair loss treatments, such as oral medications (e.g., <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/topical-finasteride-benefits-how-to-use-side-effects">finasteride</a>), low-level laser therapy, or hair transplant procedures, to improve outcomes and address multiple aspects of hair loss at once.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Minoxidil and certain growth serums may improve hair quality by increasing thickness, strength, and resilience. This can result in a fuller, healthier-looking appearance and may help reduce the visibility of thinning areas.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Many minoxidil-based products and growth serums are available over the counter without a prescription, making them accessible to a wide range of people who want to address hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>It is important to note that individual responses to minoxidil and other growth serums can differ, and results may take several months to appear. Furthermore, the benefits of these treatments are typically maintained only through consistent and long-term use. Consulting with a healthcare professional or dermatologist can provide personalised advice on the best treatment approach based on your specific needs and preferences.</span></p>
<h2><b>Home remedies for hair thickness</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Home remedies for hair thickness" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Home_remedies_for_hair_thickness_480x480.jpg?v=1722258317"/></div>
<p><span>While home remedies may not be as effective as clinically proven treatments, they can still help with hair thickness and overall health. Here are some home remedies that can help promote thicker hair:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Scalp Massage</b><span>: Massaging the scalp increases blood flow to the hair follicles, which promotes hair growth and thickness. Use your fingertips to gently massage your scalp in circular motions for a few minutes every day. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Essential Oils</b><span>: Some essential oils, including rosemary oil, peppermint oil, and lavender oil, are thought to promote hair growth and thickness. Massage a few drops of essential oil into the scalp after diluting it with a carrier oil (such as coconut oil or jojoba oil). Let it sit for at least 30 minutes before shampooing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Aloe Vera</b><span>: <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/aloe-vera-benefits-for-skin-and-hair">Aloe vera</a> has calming and moisturising qualities that can strengthen the scalp and encourage hair growth. After directly applying pure aloe vera gel to the scalp and hair and letting it sit for approximately half an hour, wash it off with warm water.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Egg Mask</b><span>: Protein, which is abundant in eggs, is necessary for strong hair development. Beat a single or double egg, then smear the mixture onto damp hair. After leaving it on for about twenty minutes, rinse it off using cool water and your regular shampoo.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Onion Juice</b><span>: <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/exploring-the-benefits-of-onion-juice-for-hair-restoration">Onion juice</a> contains sulfur, which is known to improve hair thickness and stimulate hair growth. Process the onion, extract the juice, and dab the scalp. Before shampooing, leave it on for fifteen to thirty minutes.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Green Tea Rinse</b><span>: Packed with antioxidants, green tea helps fortify hair follicles and encourage the growth of new hair. Make a pot of green tea, allow it to cool, and use it as a last rinse after shampooing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Healthy Diet</b><span>: For healthy hair growth, a diet high in protein, vitamins, and minerals should be balanced. To promote hair thickness from the inside out, include foods like eggs, fish, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in your diet.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avert Heat Styling</b><span>: Overuse of heat styling can cause thinning hair by damaging the hair shaft. Reduce the amount of time you spend using hot styling tools like curling irons, straighteners, and hair dryers. Instead, try using heat-free styling techniques whenever you can.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Protective Hairstyles</b><span>: Steer clear of tight haircuts that strain the hair because they may result in thinning and breakage. Rather, choose less tight hairstyles to reduce stress on the hair follicles.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Although using these at-home treatments can enhance hair health and thickness, it is important to use them gradually and consistently. It is best to speak with a dermatologist or other healthcare provider if you are significantly losing or thinning hair to receive individualised advice and treatment options.</span></p>
<h3><b>What ingredients should I look for to promote hair thickness?</b></h3>

<h2><b>Innovative treatments and their impact on hair health</b></h2>
<div><img alt="Innovative treatments and their impact on hair health" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Innovative_treatments_and_their_impact_on_hair_health_480x480.jpg?v=1722258389"/></div>
<p><span>Innovative hair health treatments have advanced significantly in recent years, offering promising solutions to a variety of hair concerns. Here are some innovative treatments and how they affect hair health:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy involves injecting platelet-rich plasma from the patient's blood into the scalp to promote hair growth. Platelets contain growth factors that stimulate tissue regeneration and hair follicle activity. <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/mesotherapy-versus-prp-guide-for-tackling-hair-loss">PRP therapy</a> has shown promise in terms of improving hair density, thickness, and overall hair health, particularly in people suffering from androgenetic alopecia and other forms of hair loss.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT), also known as red light therapy or cold laser therapy, involves exposing the scalp to low-level laser light to promote hair growth and health. LLLT is thought to improve blood flow to the scalp, reduce inflammation, and extend the hair growth phase (anagen phase). It is effective in promoting hair regrowth and reducing hair loss in people with different types of alopecia.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Microneedling, also known as collagen induction therapy, is the use of a device with fine needles to create micro-injuries in the scalp, which stimulates collagen production and increases topical treatment absorption. Microneedling can improve scalp health, increase hair follicle function, and stimulate hair growth. When combined with topical treatments like minoxidil or growth factors, microneedling can boost their effectiveness in improving hair health.</span></p>
</li>

<p><span>The time it takes to thicken hair depends on several factors, including the cause of thinning, the severity of the condition, and the treatment being used. It's important to note that hair thickness and growth rate are largely determined by genetics, so while certain treatments can help improve the appearance of thinning hair, they may not necessarily result in significant hair thickening.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, it can take several months to see any significant changes in hair thickness, as hair grows at an average rate of about 0.5 inches (1.25 cm) per month. With consistent use of hair-thickening treatments, such as topical minoxidil or dietary supplements like biotin and iron, some people may notice a gradual improvement in hair thickness over the course of six months to a year. However, it's important to talk to a healthcare professional or a dermatologist to determine the underlying cause of thinning hair and the most appropriate treatment plan.</span></p>

<p><span>Here are some quick daily hair care tips to encourage thicker strands:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Gentle Washing</b><span>: Use a mild shampoo and lukewarm water to wash your hair. Avoid using hot water because it can strip the hair of its natural oils, causing dryness and breakage.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Condition regularly</b><span>: After shampooing, use a conditioner that is appropriate for your hair type to moisturise and strengthen the hair. To avoid weighing down the roots, apply conditioner to the mid-lengths and ends of your hair rather than the scalp. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Limit Heat Styling</b><span>: Excessive heat can damage the hair shaft and cause thinning, so use hair dryers, straighteners, and curling irons sparingly. If you must use heat styling tools, apply a heat protectant spray first and use the lowest heat setting possible.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Avoid Tight Hairstyles</b><span>: Tight ponytails, braids, and buns can cause hair breakage and thinning. Choose looser hairstyles that relieve tension on the hair follicles.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Using a Wide-Tooth Comb</b><span>: After washing your hair, gently detangle it with a wide-tooth comb. To prevent breakage and reduce hair loss, start at the ends and work your way up to the roots.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Massage Your Scalp</b><span>: A regular scalp massage can increase blood flow to the hair follicles, promoting hair growth and thickness. Massage your scalp with your fingertips in circular motions for a few minutes every day.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Regular Haircuts</b><span>: Arrange for frequent haircuts to avoid further damaging your hair by trimming split ends. Trim your hair every 6-8 weeks to keep healthy ends and thicker-looking hair.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Protect Your Hair</b><span>: When exposed to the sun, wind, and harsh weather conditions, wear a hat or scarf to protect your hair. To protect your hair from sun damage, consider using UV-protective hair products.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consume a Balanced Diet</b><span>: A nutritious diet high in vitamins, minerals, and protein is essential for healthy hair growth. Include lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats in your diet to promote thicker and stronger hair strands.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Stay Hydrated</b><span>: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your entire body hydrated, including your hair follicles. Proper hydration is essential for maintaining healthy hair and increasing its thickness.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
