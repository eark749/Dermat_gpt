<p>Benzoyl Peroxide is an effective topical treatment for acne. It works by reducing the number of acne-causing bacteria on the skin, as well as by reducing inflammation.

<p>When used correctly, Benzoyl Peroxide can be a highly effective acne treatment, but it can also have side effects, such as dryness, redness, and irritation. It is important to start with a lower strength and gradually increase as needed, and to use it as directed by your dermatologist or the product label.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that Benzoyl Peroxide is not effective for all types of acne, and there are other treatments available, such as topical retinoids, oral antibiotics, and hormonal therapy, which may be more appropriate for certain individuals. Therefore, it is best to consult with a dermatologist to determine the best treatment plan for your specific acne concerns.</p>

<h3><strong>Benzoyl peroxide for acne scars</strong></h3>
<div><p><span><img alt="Benzoyl peroxide for acne scars" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/130_480x480.png?v=1698824556"/></span></p></div>
<p>Benzoyl peroxide is an effective treatment for acne because it helps to kill the bacteria that cause acne and also helps to unclog pores. However, it is not typically used for treating <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/acne-acne-scars">acne scars</a>.</p>
<p>Acne scars are caused by damage to the skin from severe acne. Benzoyl peroxide may help prevent further acne breakouts, which can help reduce the risk of developing new acne scars. However, once a scar has formed, benzoyl peroxide is not likely to be effective in reducing its appearance.</p>
<p>There are other treatments that may be more effective for reducing the appearance of acne scars, such as laser therapy, dermabrasion, <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/chemical-peel-for-dark-spots-and-hyperpigmentation">chemical peels</a>, and micro-needling.

Benzoyl peroxide can be used as a treatment for cystic acne, but it may not be effective on its own. In fact, dermatologists often use a combination of treatments to address cystic acne, including oral antibiotics, topical retinoids, and other medications.</p>
<p>If you have cystic acne, it is important to talk to a dermatologist about your treatment options. Your dermatologist can evaluate your skin and recommend a treatment plan that is tailored to your individual needs. They may recommend benzoyl peroxide as part of your treatment plan, but it is unlikely to be the sole treatment used.</p>

<h3><strong>Face washes and foams</strong></h3>
<div><p><span><img alt="Face washes and foams" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/134_480x480.png?v=1698824680"/></span></p></div>

<p>Face washes and foams can come in various formulations, including gel, cream, and foam. Foaming cleansers are particularly popular as they produce a rich lather that feels refreshing on the skin. However, some people with dry or sensitive skin may find that foaming <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/cleansers">cleansers</a> can be too harsh and drying.</p>
<p>When choosing a face wash or foam, it's essential to consider your skin type and concerns. For example, if you have oily skin, you may want to choose a cleanser that contains salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to help control excess oil and prevent breakouts. If you have dry or sensitive skin, look for a gentle cleanser that won't strip away natural oils.</p>
<p>To use a face wash or foam, wet your face with warm water and apply a small amount of product to your fingertips. Gently massage the cleanser into your skin in circular motions, taking care to avoid the delicate eye area. Rinse thoroughly with warm water and pat your face dry with a clean towel. Follow up with toner, serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen as part of your skincare routine.</p>

<h2><strong>Benzoyl peroxide vs Salicylic acid for acne</strong></h2>
<div><img alt="Benzoyl peroxide vs Salicylic acid for acne" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/111_8eef432b-b820-4b7b-8b1f-2d7644d2f5de_480x480.png?v=1698823009"/></div>
<p>Both benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid are commonly used to treat acne, but they work in different ways and are better suited for different types of acne.</p>
<p>Benzoyl peroxide is a powerful ingredient that can kill the bacteria that cause acne. It also helps to unclog pores and reduce inflammation. Benzoyl peroxide is particularly effective for inflammatory acne, such as papules and pustules, and is available in various strengths ranging from 2.5% to 10%.</p>
<p>Salicylic acid, on the other hand, is a beta-hydroxy acid that exfoliates the skin and helps to unclog pores. It also has anti-inflammatory properties, which can help to reduce redness and swelling associated with acne. Salicylic acid is particularly effective for non-inflammatory acne, such as blackheads and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/how-to-get-rid-of-whiteheads">whiteheads</a>.</p>
<p>In general, benzoyl peroxide is a more potent and effective ingredient for treating inflammatory acne, while salicylic acid is better for non-inflammatory acne. However, it is important to note that both ingredients can be drying and irritating to the skin, especially at higher concentrations. It is always best to start with a lower strength and gradually increase as tolerated, and to use a moisturizer to help minimize dryness and irritation.</p>
