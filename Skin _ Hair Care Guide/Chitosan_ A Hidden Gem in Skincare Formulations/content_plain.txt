Chitosan is undoubtedly a valuable ingredient in skincare formulas. Chitosan, a natural polymer derived from chitin, a substance naturally present in the shells of crustaceans like prawns and crabs, has several advantages when added to skincare products. This blog provides an overview of its roles and properties.
Delving into Chitosan’s Origin and Properties
Chitin, a material present in the exoskeletons of crustaceans including prawns, crabs, and lobsters, is the source of the natural polymer chitosan. Deacetylation is the process of removing acetyl groups from chitin to create chitosan, a more soluble and bioactive molecule.  Crustacean shells, which are often a byproduct of the seafood industry, are the source of chitosan. It is therefore a renewable and sustainable resource. Given that chitosan is derived from crab shells, it is crucial to think about the quality and purity of the ingredients when selecting skincare products that contain it, especially for people who have shellfish allergies. Additionally, when introducing new products to your skincare routine, a patch test and
consultation with a dermatologist
are recommended, especially if you have specific skin concerns or sensitivities.
