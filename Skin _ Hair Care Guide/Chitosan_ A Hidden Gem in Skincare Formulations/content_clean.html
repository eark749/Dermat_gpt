<div><img alt="Delving into Chitosan’s Origin and Properties" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_3_-_2023-10-20T120308.466_480x480.png?v=1697783602"/></div>
<p><span><br/>Chitin, a material present in the exoskeletons of crustaceans including prawns, crabs, and lobsters, is the source of the natural polymer chitosan. Deacetylation is the process of removing acetyl groups from chitin to create chitosan, a more soluble and bioactive molecule.  Crustacean shells, which are often a byproduct of the seafood industry, are the source of chitosan. It is therefore a renewable and sustainable resource. Given that chitosan is derived from crab shells, it is crucial to think about the quality and purity of the ingredients when selecting skincare products that contain it, especially for people who have shellfish allergies. Additionally, when introducing new products to your skincare routine, a patch test and <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">consultation with a dermatologist</a> are recommended, especially if you have specific skin concerns or sensitivities.</span></p>
