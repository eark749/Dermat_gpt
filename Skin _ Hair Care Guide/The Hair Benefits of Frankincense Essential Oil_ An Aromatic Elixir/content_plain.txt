What is Frankincense Essential Oil?
Frankincense essential oil is a highly regarded aromatic oil extracted from the resin of the Boswellia tree, specifically Boswellia sacra, Boswellia carterii, and Boswellia frereana. Boswellia trees are endemic to the Arabian Peninsula, East Africa, and India.

The essential oil is subsequently extracted from these resin tears using steam distillation. Frankincense essential oil has a warm, woody, resinous scent with notes of citrus and spice. It is extensively used in aromatherapy due to its therapeutic benefits, which include the capacity to promote relaxation, reduce tension, and improve general well-being. Additionally, frankincense essential oil is regarded for its skincare advantages, which include boosting cell regeneration, minimizing the appearance of
scars
and
wrinkles
, and calming irritated skin. The chemical composition of frankincense essential oil varies depending on the Boswellia tree species and the source's geographical location.
