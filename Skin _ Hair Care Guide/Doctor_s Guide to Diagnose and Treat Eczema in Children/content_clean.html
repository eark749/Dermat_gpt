<p><span>The management of childhood eczema involves avoiding eczema triggers. Following are some pointers for recognizing and avoiding typical triggers:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Allergens</b><span>: Some children can develop eczema as a result of allergies to things like dust mites, pet dander, pollen, and mold. Keep your child's environment clean and dust-free, use air purifiers or HEPA filters, and steer clear of outdoor activities during peak pollen seasons to try to reduce your child's exposure to these allergens.</span></p>

</li>
