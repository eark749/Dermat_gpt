<p><span>As revealed above it will all be natural. By ‘Natural’, we mean a lot many things. Keep on reading below to know about it.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong> Natural Looking Makeup:</strong><span>Embracing your natural self will be the ‘mantra’ for 2024, when it comes to makeup. Unlike last decade, where hiding those freckles and spots was the chief aim of doing makeup, people are slowly gaining a good perspective wherein they are beginning to get comfortable in their own skin. They are using makeup to further accentuate their looks. Instead of hiding those blemishes, people are being more inclined towards correcting them. Products like </span><strong><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-nia-serum">Clinikally The Ultimate NIA (10% Niacinamide) Serum </a></strong><span>have gained an extensive popularity to fade away dark spots, freckles and acne marks.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong> Skincare That Is Responsibly Sourced:</strong><span>With increasing level of consciousness and awareness among the consumers, using the products that are sourced responsibly, without any traces of animal cruelty, or child labour is gaining an upward trend. Various products by </span><span>Eterno Distributors</span><span> such as </span><span>Shangpree Rich Moist Modeling Mask</span><span>; and products by </span><span>Skinska Pharmaceutica </span><span>are cruelty free products and are gaining a huge popularity among people.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong> Being Sustainable In Our Approach To Skincare:</strong><span>Due to a drastic shift in the conscience of the consumers, the leading brands have switched to making conscious choices while formulating products. Just like people are warding away fast fashion and adopting slow fashion, a similar trend is seen in the skin and beauty industry. People are trusting those brands that are curating responsibly sourced products and follow certain policies like zero waste, recyclable products etc. Also, waterless beauty products are a roar these days. They use no water in their formulations, instead focus on using botanical oils and active ingredients. As a result products like </span><span>Clinikally Hyaluronic SkinBooster Serum</span><span> are getting loved by the masses.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong> Switching To Natural Products:<br/></strong><span>Not only in India, but people living overseas are also gravitating to Indian skincare as described in Ayurveda. Benefits of applying products such as turmeric, saffron etc. are gaining popularity. People prefer to use pure aloe vera gel  to relieve mild acne and associated redness instead of various medicinal tubes.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong> Bidding Adieu To Chemicals:</strong><span>Lately, people have realised the detrimental effect of using various chemicals and medicinal products on the skin. Apart from the benefits offered by various chemicals, people have become aware about the adverse effects associated with those as well. As a result, people are gravitating more towards using natural products. People have become aware of the importance of </span><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist"><strong>consulting a dermatologis</strong>t </a></span><span>before using products containing any chemical.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong> Turning Towards The Kitchen For Effective Home Remedies:</strong><span>People have gravitated back to their kitchen and pantry for quick, effective and cost-efficient skincare. For exfoliation, people are using sugar, since it has natural AHA in it. To lighten the blemishes, people are applying D.I.Y Face packs containing freshly squeezed lemon/ lime juice or by rubbing kiwi pieces onto the skin. Ages old ‘Grandma’s Remedies’ that were long gone and forgotten, are coming back to life again.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Eco-Conscious Choices in Beauty Products</b></h3>
<p><span>The consumer is aware and well informed now. He knows the importance of checking out the label for various keywords like </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>cruelty-free,</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>vegan,</span></p>
</li>

<h3><b>The Rise of Minimalist Beauty Aesthetics</b></h3>
<p><span>People are not only chanting ‘Minimal is the new maximal’ mantra but are also living by it. They are extensively following and believing this principle. Certain pointers that ‘Gen-Z’, ‘‘Gen-Alpha’, and Millennials’ are living by are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong> Clutter Free Cabinets<br/></strong><span>People, these days, are more inclined towards quality instead of quantity. Not only in fashion, but also in skincare and makeup, people want a ‘statement’ piece. Products like </span><strong><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-sunprotect-sunscreen-spf-50">Clinikally SunProtect Sunscreen SPF 50/PA+++ </a></strong><span>are becoming a go-to choice due to combined benefits of high sun protection and <strong><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hydrasoothe-moisturiser">ceramides moisturization</a></strong> in one bottle. </span><span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<strong> Less Is More<br/></strong><span>People are gravitating towards using less products when doing makeup. Instead of piling up skin care and makeup products, people are using the make products that offer additional benefits to the skin. Makeup products with Aloe Vera, Argan oil, Vitamin C, Vitamin E etc. are lining up on the shelves for customers. Customers are also buying the products that are serums or moisturisers, but have a little <strong><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-pigment-corrector-cream">pigment</a></strong> in them to hide those blemishes.</span><span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<strong> Skincare &gt; Makeup<br/></strong><span>People are understanding the importance of skin care. They believe in investing in skincare more as compared to makeup. They have understood that makeup will look flawless over the skin that is healthy. Instead of spending a lump sum on a hydrating foundation, people are more in favour of investing in hydrating serums like </span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-hyaluronic-skinbooster-serum"><strong>Clinikally Hyaluronic SkinBooster Serum</strong><span>.</span></a> <span>People are preferring to use </span><strong><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-vitamin-c3-serum">Clinikally Vitamin C3+ Serum</a></strong><span> to minimise age spots and blemishes instead of spending bucks on a concealer to hide them.</span><span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<strong> Korean Glass Skin<br/></strong><span>With increased globalisation in cinema, K-Dramas have gained an immense fan-following amongst people. Its effect can be seen not only in jewellery and clothing preferences amongst the viewers, but also in an increased interest among people to achieve the korean glass skin. Korean glass skin implies a luminous and glowing skin that appears crystal-clear and translucent with absence of pores, that appears like a clean piece of glass. As a result, Korean skincare products are witnessing an upsurge. </span><span>Shangpree Diamond Luminous Cream</span><span> is a Korean product that is infused with real diamond powder for detoxification of the skin, making the skin glow. </span><span>Ultra-V Idebenone Signature Ampouls </span><span>is another Korean product that helps achieve signature glass skin.</span>

<h2><b>Technological Advances Shaping Future Beauty Trends<br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="Technological Advances Shaping Future Beauty Trends" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_Design_4_-_2024-01-08T131036.964_480x480.png?v=1704699670"/></div>
<p><span>Technological advancements are revolutionising beauty trends, propelling the industry into a future where innovation meets personalization. The emergence of AI and AR technologies allows for tailored product recommendations and virtual try-ons, enhancing customer experience. Biotechnology is being harnessed to create sustainable, highly effective ingredients, marking a shift towards eco-conscious beauty solutions. The integration of digital tools in product development and customer engagement is setting new standards in personal care, merging science and aesthetics to deliver unique, futuristic beauty experiences.</span></p>
<h3><b>Integrating Technology in Beauty Routines</b></h3>
<p><span>The integration of technology in the beauty and aesthetic industry is revolutionising the way consumers experience beauty products and services:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong> Skin Analysis Tools:<br/></strong><span>These allow an in-depth analysis of the skin type and it’s characteristics, specifying the concerns and problems.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong> Wearable Skin Care Gadgets:<br/></strong><span>Gadgets such as UV Rays Monitors provide real-time skin health tracking. This allows to minimise the risk exposure for skin health.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong> Advanced Tools:<br/></strong><span>With advancement of technology, tools like Red Light Therapy Devices are accessible with ease to the consumer. It aids skin in healing and repairing.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong> Augmented Reality:<br/></strong><span>Augmented Reality has emerged as a groundbreaker in the beauty industry. It provides a leeway to the consumer to see a virtual try on of the beauty and skin care product. As far as makeup is considered, consumers can also save their desired and loved looks to try in future. </span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Customization and Personalization in Skincare</b></h3>
<p><span>Due to advancing technology, skincare that is unique to a person can be curated to cater to the needs of a particular individual. Various ways in which technology has helped us to do that are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Thanks to Artificial Intelligence, we can mention our concerns to the robots, along with specifying our skin type, problems, age, gender and financial budget, and in turn can avail a skincare regimen that is unique only to us. Additional perk is that it can be customised or altered anytime.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>This innovation also utilises our browsing history on various platforms to assess our interests, which results in formulating the regimen that consists of the products and brands of our liking and taste.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Also, the bots send personalised messages to the consumer on an estimated date of refill, whenever they need to restock or refill the product. This ensures consistency in skincare regimen, thereby ensuring maximum results.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>All of this results in an enhanced retail experience and satisfaction of the customer. The individual not only gets consistent in his skincare routine, but also feels ‘special’ as consumer psychology is satisfied. It happens because a modern day consumer does not want to be told ‘what to do’  by brands, instead the consumer wants the brand to customise the product as per his demand/ need. Advancing technology satisfies this aspect of consumer psychology, hence it is blooming tremendously in the beauty industry.</span><span><br/></span></p>
<h3><b>Digital Tools Revolutionising Beauty Experiences</b></h3>
<p><span>With the advent of AI, the beauty industry has experienced a tremendous leap. With various tools that aid in determining various skin concerns like moisture level, dryness, increased UV exposure; skincare practices have made a steep change. With virtual trials available at our fingertips, we indeed are witnessing a revolution in the beauty industry.</span></p>
<h2><b>Embracing Inclusivity and Mindfulness in Beauty<br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="Embracing Inclusivity and Mindfulness in Beauty" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_design_2_2_480x480.jpg?v=1704700289"/></div>
<p><span>Having an all-inclusive approach is the pivotal demand of the hour </span><span>and the beauty industry is adeptly responding to this call. In today's era, a comprehensive approach in beauty and skincare, catering to the diverse needs and preferences of all consumers, has become essential. This shift is not just about offering varied products, but also about reflecting the rich tapestry of global beauty standards in every aspect of the industry.</span></p>
<h3><b>Inclusive Products for Diverse Beauty Needs</b></h3>
<p><span>The Beauty Industry has often received criticism for being centred around only 1 particular group of population. However, it has responded positively to it and has taken required actions to compensate it such as:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Products are now gender neutral. They are available to people of all genders. Even the big beauty brands have started making men, and people of LGBTQ community to represent them, as opposed to the norm of having girls as brand ambassadors.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Not only youth, but people in the later stages of life are also being recognized as a consumer. The skincare industry is developing products that cater to the mature population and even has mature models to represent them. The big brands are now understanding the power and influence that people in the age group of 45-65 years have on the market.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>As far as makeup is concerned, earlier a huge colour range was not available to choose from, but now, it’s not only available for light or dark skinned people, but also variations in olive, brown and wheat colour complexions are being recognized and makeup products catering to them are being formulated.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Brands are now taking an inclusive approach to various skin conditions and are formulating products keeping in mind the conditions like eczema and rosacea. The skin care and makeup products are now incorporating various skin friendly and skin soothing ingredients like green tea, aloe vera etc. to calm down the angry skin.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Such measures have resulted in a wider consumer base of the brands and has also inculcated the feeling of ‘being included’ in a vast majority of people that were feeling sidelined due to age, gender preferences or various skin conditions.</span></p>
<h3><b>Mindful Beauty Practices for Holistic Wellbeing</b></h3>
<p><span>The continuous hustle of the day and humdrum routine at night, has taken a toll not only on the physical health of people but has also jeopardised the mental well being to a huge extent. As a result, a small retreat to nature is required every now and then. While travelling to mountains or beach and relaxing in the lap of nature will always be the first and the best choice, however, it is not always a viable option. So, how to achieve solace in the comfort of your home, without spending too much? Well, continue reading below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong> Using Natural Ingredients:</strong><span>Incorporating ingredients like turmeric, saffron, rose etc. into the skincare is an effective way to be in touch with nature. It allows our skin and body to get aligned with nature. Being in touch with nature on a regular basis allows our energy to be in a synergistic exchange with nature. Eventually, it calms and relaxes our mind.</span><span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<strong> Rubbing Natural Oils:</strong><span>Using natural oils like that of lavender, jasmine and rose not only offers an antioxidant boost to the skin but also stimulates our senses. It employs a multisensory approach to calm the mind due to its texture, fragrance, and feel.</span><span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<strong> Slow Beauty:</strong><span>Adopting the products that are responsibly resourced creates a feeling of oneness with nature. This leaves behind immense psychological satisfaction of not harming nature and environment in any way, and as the quote goes ‘Content mind is a rich mind’! Hence, being aligned with nature increases our contentment. </span><span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<strong> Mini At-Home Spas:</strong><span>Indulging in tender, love and care practices increases the happy hormones in the body. One of the ways to achieve that is to dive into some ‘me-time’. Light those fragrant candles, use refreshing body scrubs and body washes, load up yourself with natural body butters and oils. All this will allow you to experience multi sensory satisfaction and will soothe and calm the mind, along with achieving a healthy, nourished skin.</span><span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<strong> Eat Good and Sleep Better:</strong><span>According to our ancient and rich Ayurveda, eating the food that is light and organically sourced, works to keep the mind in check; and with the mind in check, an individual enjoys a sound sleep. A body that is well rested, naturally remains in the state of calm. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>The Shift Towards Conscious Beauty Consumption</b></h3>
<p><span>Today’s consumer is very aware of his demands and needs. However, this did not occur overnight. This gradual shift has occurred slowly over years, and has evolved to today’s ‘Conscious Beauty’ trend over time.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Earlier the trend in the beauty industry was ‘Green Beauty’. It used to emphasise on using the products that were environment friendly and did little to no harm to the environment. A term similar to this called ‘Blue Beauty’ also gained popularity. It emphasised on being ocean friendly. This was a major shift that happened in the beauty industry which was a start of revolution in the beauty industry.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The next trend was ‘Clean Beauty’. People now demanded the products that not only were sustainable for nature, but also were devoid of any harmful chemicals. The products that did not perform animal or human testing also come under the category of clean beauty.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The next major leap was ‘Conscious Beauty’. The customer is now demanding the basics of clean and green beauty along with a skincare that is specifically tailored to their skin type and concern. The consumer is now conscious and well aware of his own needs and knows what his skin requires. This has resulted in a high tide of ‘Conscious Beauty’ products. </span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><b>The Evolution of Beauty: Looking Beyond 2024<br/></b></h2>
<div><img alt="The Evolution of Beauty: Looking Beyond 2024" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Khushi_Blog_design_2_-_2024-01-08T132934.981_480x480.png?v=1704700800"/></div>
<p><span>Beyond 2024 a variety of things are bound to manifest.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>The beauty industry is poised to embrace a fusion of technology and personalised skincare. An upsurge in AI-driven beauty apps is likely that offers customised skin and hair care recommendations. Augmented reality (AR) will further revolutionise the consumer experience with virtual try-ons becoming more accurate.</span><span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Sustainability will be at the forefront, with eco-friendly and zero-waste products becoming increasingly mainstream. There will be a shift towards ingredients that are not only beneficial for skin and hair but also ethically sourced and environmentally sustainable. Shopping racks and carts will be full of such products.</span><span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<span>More advanced formulations owing to the rise of biotechnology in beauty will occur. This is likely to include bio-engineered ingredients and microbiome skincare that focuses on maintaining, improving and enhancing the natural flora of skin for better health and appearance.</span><span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Beauty technology will also witness a huge advancement in skin care devices for home use, that would offer treatments that were once exclusive to salons and parlours. From LED light therapy to advanced microcurrent devices, home skincare routines will become more efficient and tech-driven. People will embrace it with open arms and will see it as a one-time investment.</span><span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Inclusivity will continue to be a key theme, with brands expanding their product lines to cater to a diverse range of skin tones and types. Beauty industry, which was once often criticised for catering to young females, will open its avenues to include all ages and identities. </span><span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li><span>A heightened focus on 'clean beauty' is bound to be at its full swing, emphasising transparency in ingredient sourcing and product manufacturing.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Overall, in a nutshell, the future beauty trends will encapsulate a blend of technological innovation, ethical practices, and a holistic approach to beauty and wellness. A glorious future of the beauty industry is at the doorstep, and people are graciously contributing to make it a boon not only for humankind, but for the environment at large.</span></p>
