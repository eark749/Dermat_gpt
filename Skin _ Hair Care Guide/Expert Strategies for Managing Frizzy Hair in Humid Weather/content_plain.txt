Managing frizzy hair is tough. But managing frizzy hair in humid weather is the ultimate battle. It’s challenging. However, with expert dermatologist backed strategies, frizzy hair can be managed and silky smooth hair can be achieved. Humidity often makes the hair frizzy, thus making hair styling a daunting task. But do not worry, as we, at
Clinikally
, will help you understand the root causes of frizzy hair and shall implement targeted techniques to achieve frizz control with ease. By following this guide, frizzy hair can be managed with ease even in humid weather conditions.
Understanding Frizz: Why Humidity Affects Your Hair
Humidity can significantly affect and impact the hair condition. It can do it due to single or a combination of various reasons listed below:
Moisture Absorption- The hair strand is hygroscopic in nature, implying that it readily absorbs moisture from air. During humid conditions, with an increase in the moisture content of the air, the hair strand also absorbs the excess moisture and swells up. This swelling of the hair shaft makes the hair frizzy and rough, due to a distorted cuticle layer that is otherwise smooth.
Hair Structure and Porosity- The innate structure and properties of hair also play a key role. The hair that is curly/ wavy, has a naturally disrupted cuticle layer. Due to an increase in the surface area, moisture absorption is more, thereby making it appear more frizzy and rough. In addition, if the hair has a higher porosity, it swells up more, thus appearing more frizzy, as compared to the hair having less porosity.
Hydrogen Bonds- These bonds are present in the hair structure that holds the hair together. Due to high humidity, these bonds get broken. Instead, moisture from air is absorbed and the hair becomes frizzy and difficult to manage.
Cuticle Layer Disruption- With the disruption of the cuticle layer due to humidity, the overlapping cells of the cuticle open up. This causes the penetration of moisture into the shaft. As a result, the hair becomes frizzy and prone to breakage.
Loss of Natural Oils- It can occur due to increased humidity. Due to the absence of the natural oil, hair becomes dry. As a result, it becomes susceptible to frizz. Additionally, to compensate for the loss of oil, the scalp secretes more oil, causing an oily scalp with dry end.
Hence, humidity is the leading cause of the hair becoming frizzy.
The Science Behind Hair Frizz
When individual hair strands become dry and tangled, it creates a rough appearance. It is referred to as ‘Frizzy hair’. It not only has a messy appearance but is also unmanageable.
Hair is composed of three main layers (from outside to inside)- Cuticle, Cortex and Medulla. It is the cuticle layer that significantly influences hair frizz. When the cells of the cuticle are lying flat and overlapped, the hair strand appears smooth. When these cells get distorted due to humidity, it causes the hair to become frizzy, rough and unmanageable. As mentioned above, these cells open up due increased humidity and breakage of the hydrogen bonds of the hair, resulting in frizz and roughness. Frizz becomes more noticeable if the hair strand has a higher porosity. Higher porosity is usually caused by exposing the hair to various chemical and physical stimulants. All these factors play together to cause the hair to become frizzy and rough.
H3: How Humidity Impacts Different Hair Types
Link 1: Humidity & Hair Types
Humidity affects different hair types differently. Keep reading to know more.
Straight Hair often looks flat and limp in humid conditions, due to a slight swelling. This usually causes lack of volume, increased greasiness, and difficulty in holding various hairstyles.
Wavy Hair often becomes frizzy and undefined in humid weather conditions. This causes an increased roughness and frizz, loss of wave definition, and a puffy appearance.
Curly Hair is highly susceptible and prone to humidity. The hair often becomes expanded and frizzy. The natural curly pattern of the hair loses its definition and becomes inconsistent and erratic. The volume increases considerably and often becomes unmanageable.
4.Kinky/ Coily Hair often feels softer due to moisture absorption. However, it causes the hair to shrink and become frizzy. The tight curled pattern becomes highly erratic and undefined. This also makes such types of hair more entangled.
Common Mistakes That Exacerbate Frizz
Frizz can be exacerbated by various flaws and mistakes in our hair care regimen. Frizz can be tamed by understanding and correcting those mistakes;
Hot Showers: Avoid hot showers. Though hot showers are amazing to indulge in, it often strips off natural oils from the hair. This inturn makes the hair dry and dehydrated, thereby making the hair more prone to frizz. Instead, use either cold or lukewarm water to take a shower.
Using Harsh Products: Hair care products that are full of alcohol and sulphates can prove to be very harmful and troublesome for the hair. Hence, always look for the sulphate-free or alcohol-free products like shampoos to cleanse and style your hair. This will ensure that natural oils don’t get removed, thus minimising the frizz.
Avoiding Conditioners: Incorporate various conditioners in your hair care routine to make the hair look smooth. Lack of the conditioning elements often causes drying of hair. Opt for conditioners that have “Frizz Control” or “Hydrating” words on the labels. Using the conditioners ensures that the outer layer of the hair is smooth and the moisture is locked in properly. In addition, a lightweight leave-in conditioner can also be incorporated into your hair care regimen.
Frequent Hair Combing: Frequent hair brushing and combing can make the hair more frizzy due to development of static. Also, cuticles get disrupted as well causing the hair to become frizzier.
Using Narrow-Tooth Comb: Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle and brush your hair. Start combing from the bottom of your ends and work upto the top, to avoid hair breakage.. Also, comb/ brush your hair, only when necessary.
Using Excessive Heat: Using excess heat styling tools like curling rods or hair straighteners can excessively destroy the hair. This makes the hair more susceptible to frizz. If heat is to be used, make sure to use it sparingly. In addition, use a heat protector beforehand.
Excessive Towel Drying of Hair: Using towels to dry the hair often results in friction. It causes roughening of the hair cuticle, thereby causing frizz. Instead, it is recommended to use a microfibre towel as it absorbs excess moisture, without causing any damage to the hair.
Delaying A Hair Trim: Split ends often gives the appearance of frizzy hair due to unevenness. Hence, it is recommended to regularly get a trim, every 6-8 weeks.
Using Cotton Pillowcases: Cotton absorbs the moisture from the hair. This makes the air dry and frizzy. Instead, it is recommended to use silk or satin pillowcase due to minimal friction.
If the above mentioned mistakes are taken care of and avoided, the frizz and roughness can be effectively tamed.

H3: Washing and Conditioning Tips
To minimise the frizz, wash, cleanse and condition properly to attain frizz-free hair. Continue reading to know more about it in detail.
Tips for Washing the Hair:
Avoid washing hair everyday. Instead wash it twice or thrice weekly. Excessive washing of hair, strips off the natural oils that keeps the hair frizz free.
If you have an oily scalp, a dry shampoo can be incorporated at the roots to absorb excess oil.
Avoid washing your hair with hot water. Instead opt for cold or slight lukewarm water. It is so because it ensures that the hair cuticle gets closed, thereby preventing drying of the hair.
Choose a sulphate-free or gentle shampoo. Avoid harsh shampoos.
Massage the shampoo on the scalp to remove oil, dirt and grime. Avoid using it at the tips as this can make the hair dry, frizzy and prone to breakage.
In addition, avoid harsh scrubbing.
Rinse properly with cold water. Ensure that no product remains on the scalp and hair.
Tips for Conditioning the Hair:
Opt for a hydrating formula of the conditioners. Ingredients like shea butter, argan oil, cocoa butter and coconut oil deeply moisturise and nourish the hair. This in turn, reduces frizz.
Seren Nutri-Repair Conditioner
is a great recommendation.
Always apply the conditioner from the midlength to the root ends. Do not apply it on the scalp. Applying the conditioner near the roots often weighs down the hair.
It is highly recommended to detangle the hair with a wide tooth comb when the conditioner is still on. This prevents hair breakage.
It is recommended to deeply condition your hair once weekly with a hair mask. It provides nutrients to the hair. Being highly concentrated, the nutrients penetrate into the hair deeply.
H3: Effective Hair Drying Techniques
Improper hair drying techniques also exacerbate frizz, thus causing hair breakage. Following correct hair drying techniques is very essential to make the hair more manageable and less prone to breakage:
Do not rub the hair. Instead, squeeze out the excess water with your hands. Use a microfiber towel to absorb excess water. This ensures that friction is not generated, thus ensuring frizz free hair.
Using a leave-in conditioner like
Q-Sera Leave-In Conditioner
ensures that the hair gets adequately hydrated. This results in softening the hair. As a result, friction is minimised, thus taming the frizz and reducing hair damage while drying the hair.
Detangle the hair using a wide toothed comb while the leave-in conditioner is already applied. Due to resolution of the knots, hair breakage and frizz is prevented while drying the hair.
While using a blow dryer for drying the hair, ensure that heat selected is the most minimal. It is so because higher temperature strips the hair of the moisture and makes it frizzy.
Also, while blow drying, ensure to hold it 6 inches away from the hair to reduce heat exposure.
It is recommended to use a diffuser attachment of the blow dryer as it distributes and disperses the heat and the airflow.
Divide and Section your hair for efficient drying. It is recommended to dry the lower sections first and gradually move to the top ones. This prevents overdrying of the hair.
Direct the blow dryer downwards. This ensures that the airflow is directed downwards, which aids in smoothing the hair cuticle and reducing the frizz.
Once the hair gets dried, use the cool jolt of hair for a few seconds. It not only seals the cuticle but also adds lustre to the hair and makes it frizz free.
Use the ‘Plop Method’ to dry your hair. After applying leave-in conditioner, make sure to detangle the hair. Afterwards, flip the hair and wrap a microfibre cloth around it. It shall ensure the absorption of excess moisture, leading to drying the hair in a frizz free way.
‘Microplop Method’ is also encouraged. It includes squeezing out the excess water with a microfibre towel followed by gently scrunching the hair with a microfibre cloth. It promotes defined waves and curls while the hair air-dries.
While the hair is drying, touching the hair is immensely discouraged
H3: Styling Products That Tame Frizz
Frizz is the biggest enemy of hair. Hence, styling the hair becomes of paramount value. Some powerful ingredients that tame frizz are:
Silicones are extensively used as smoothing agents as they are able to create a smooth, slippery surface of the hair. This reduces friction and frizz considerably. Also hair strands are prevented from sticking together.
Humectants like panthenol, aloe vera, honey and glycerine are extensively used in anti-frizz products. These are capable of absorbing moisture from the surrounding atmosphere, thereby keeping the hair smooth and hydrated.
Natural Oils and Butters like Argan Oil, Jojoba Oil, Shea butter and coconut oil are of immense importance for taming frizz. These are capable of moisturising and nourishing the hair deeply, resulting in a smooth cuticle, thereby preventing frizz.
Keratin is a protein that has the ability to strengthen and smoothen the hair. It reduces frizz considerably. Naturally, keratin is present in the hair. Additional keratin further beneficates the hair.
Silk Amino Acids are also similar to the hair proteins structurally and enhances texture of the hair.
An ingredient called Polyquaternium is referred to as a film forming polymer. It creates a thin film/ layer around the hair strand. This not only controls frizz, but also adds definition to the hair.
Cationic Polymers are positively charged polymers. These often bind to the cuticle of hair since it is negatively charged. This reduces the frizz, and improves manageability and adds lustre to the hair.
