<div><img alt="Step-by-Step Guide to Applying Primer" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Step-by-Step_Guide_to_Applying_Primer_480x480.jpg?v=1719390128"/></div>
<p><span>Proper primer application is essential to getting a flawless, long-wearing base for your makeup. The following instructions will help you apply primer like a pro:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Step 1</b><span>:</span><b> Cleanse Your Face</b><span>:</span> <span>The intention is to get rid of contaminants, oil, and grime. Apply a mild <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/clinikally-foaming-face-wash">cleanser</a> appropriate for your skin type. Dry your face using a fresh towel.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Step 2</b><span>:</span><b> Moisturize</b><span>:</span> <span>The goal is to moisturise your skin so that makeup goes on smoothly. Use a moisturiser suitable for the type of skin on your body. Give it a full minute or more to absorb completely before proceeding to the next step.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Step 3</b><span>: </span><b>Apply Sunscreen (if needed)</b><span>: Its goal is to shield your skin from damaging UV radiation. Put on a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a minimum SPF of thirty. Permit it to fully seep into your skin.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Step 4</b><span>:</span><b> Select the Right Primer</b><span>: Addressing particular skin issues and producing a smooth base are the goals. Choose a primer that addresses the issues and kind of your skin (e.g., moisturising for dry skin, mattifying for oily skin).</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Step 5</b><span>: </span><b>Dispense the Primer</b><span>: Primer should be dispensed to guarantee that you have the appropriate quantity of product. Using your fingertips, the back of your hand, or a clean palette, squeeze out a pea-sized amount.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Step 6</b><span>:</span><b> Dot the Primer on Your Face</b><span>: The goal is to apply the primer evenly on your face by dotting it on there. Apply a few tiny dots of primer to your chin, cheekbones, nose, and forehead.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Step 7</b><span>: </span><b>Blend the Primer</b><span>: Blend the primer to get a uniform, smooth coating. Blend the primer outward from the centre of your face using your fingertips, a brush, or a sponge. Concentrate on areas (such as the T-zone for oily skin) where your makeup tends to smear or where you have particular problems.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Step 8</b><span>: </span><b>Let the Primer Set</b><span>: The goal is to let the primer set so that it will stick to your skin. To ensure the primer sets thoroughly, let it a full minute or two. This guarantees that it creates a suitable foundational base.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Step 9</b><span>: </span><b>Use Additional Primers as Needed</b><span>: Targeted primers are intended to address particular areas. Apply eye primer to your eyelids to improve the application of eyeshadow. If you want your lipstick to linger longer, use a lip primer.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Step 10</b><span>:</span><b> Apply Foundation</b><span>: The goal is to finish up your foundational makeup. Using your choice application tool (brush, sponge, or fingertips), apply your foundation over the prepped areas.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Common Mistakes to Avoid with Primer</b></h3>
<p><span>The endurance and appearance of your makeup can be greatly improved by using a primer correctly, but some frequent blunders might reduce its efficacy. Avoid these mistakes: not properly prepping your skin, applying too much primer, not letting it set, selecting the incorrect primer for your skin type, applying primer over moisturiser or sunscreen too soon, mixing an incompatible primer with foundation, avoiding certain areas of your skin, rubbing rather than patting, omitting primer entirely, layering too many products, and using old or expired primer.
