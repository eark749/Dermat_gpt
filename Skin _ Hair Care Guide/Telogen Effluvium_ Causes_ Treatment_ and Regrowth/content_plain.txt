Telogen effluvium is a common type of hair loss that occurs when a large number of hair follicles on the scalp enter the resting phase (telogen phase) and eventually shed. This condition can be triggered by various factors, such as stress, hormonal changes, medications, or a medical condition.
Telogen effluvium is caused by stress, hormonal changes, medications, nutritional deficiencies, and medical conditions.
Treatment for telogen effluvium includes identifying and addressing the underlying cause, nutritional supplements, scalp treatments, medication adjustments, low-level laser therapy (LLLT), and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy.
Regrowth strategies include patience, a healthy lifestyle, gentle hair care, and regular check-ups.
Hair regrowth following telogen effluvium can take several months to a year, and some people may not experience full regrowth. With proper treatment, the regrowth of hair should begin in a few months. However, it is essential to treat the underlying cause, and any nutritional deficiencies to promote hair growth.
What is Telogen Effluvium
Telogen Effluvium is a type of hair loss characterized by excessive
shedding
or
thinning of hair
on the scalp. It occurs when a large number of hair follicles enter the resting phase of the hair growth cycle (telogen phase) at the same time, resulting in a sudden and noticeable
loss of hair
.
Hair typically grows in a cyclical pattern with three phases:
Anagen Phase
: This is the active growth phase when hair follicles produce new hair. This phase usually lasts several years.
Catagen Phase
: A stage between the anagen and telogen phases in which hair growth slows and follicles begin to shrink.
Telogen Phase
: This is the resting phase when the hair follicles are dormant. After this phase, the hair sheds and new hair grows in its place. The telogen phase usually lasts several months.
In telogen effluvium, a large number of hair follicles simultaneously enter the telogen phase prematurely, leading to increased shedding of hair. This can result in noticeable thinning of the hair, although it typically doesn't cause bald patches.
The condition is typically temporary and can occur in both men and women. Some common causes of Telogen Effluvium include significant stress, hormonal changes (such as after pregnancy or during menopause), rapid weight loss or malnutrition, certain medications, and underlying medical conditions such as thyroid disorders or autoimmune diseases.
Telogen Effluvium usually resolves on its own within a few months to a year. In some cases, treatment may be recommended to address the underlying cause of hair loss or to promote
hair growth
. A healthcare provider or a
dermatologist
can help diagnose and recommend appropriate treatment options for Telogen Effluvium.
Causes of Telogen Effluvium
Telogen Effluvium is a type of hair loss that occurs due to a disruption in the normal hair growth cycle. The hair growth cycle involves three stages:
anagen
(active growth),
catagen
(transition phase), and
telogen
(resting phase).
Anagen
(active growth)
Catagen
(transition phase)
Telogen
(resting phase).
This is your hair growth cycle's most active stage. Cells in the lower part of a hair follicle divide quickly. When new hair grows, it pushes the hair out of the follicle and lengthens the hair shafts. A hair follicle can grow hair for up to four years in the anagen stage. At any given time, 80% to 90% of your hair follicles are in the anagen stage.
This is a stage in the growth cycle of your hair. Your hair follicle's lower portion regresses and stops growing. At any given time, approximately 5% of all hairs are in the catagen stage.
This is the stage of your hair growth cycle when it is at rest. The hair follicle is dormant, and there is a white keratin bulb at the root (club hair). The keratin bulb keeps the hair in the follicle until it sheds, at which point the hair growth cycle begins again. At any given time, approximately 5% of all hairs are in the telogen stage.
Telogen Effluvium occurs when a large number of hair follicles suddenly shift from the anagen phase to the telogen phase, causing hair to shed prematurely. The most common causes of Telogen Effluvium include:
Physical or emotional stress
: Stressful events such as illness, surgery, childbirth, or the death of a loved one can trigger Telogen Effluvium.
Hormonal changes
: Changes in hormonal levels, such as those that occur during menopause or
pregnancy
, can also lead to Telogen Effluvium.
Nutritional deficiencies
: A lack of certain nutrients, such as
iron
or protein, can cause Telogen Effluvium.
Medications
: Some medications, such as blood thinners, beta-blockers, or chemotherapy drugs, can cause Telogen Effluvium.
Thyroid problems
: Thyroid imbalances, such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, can lead to Telogen Effluvium.
Autoimmune diseases
: Certain autoimmune diseases, such as lupus or
alopecia areata
, can cause Telogen Effluvium.
Scalp infections
: Scalp infections, such as
ringworm
or folliculitis, can cause Telogen Effluvium.
Hairstyling practices
: Certain hairstyling practices, such as tight braids or weaves, can cause Telogen Effluvium.
Telogen effluvium is usually reversible once the underlying cause is identified and treated. However, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional, preferably a dermatologist or trichologist, to determine the underlying cause and devise an appropriate treatment strategy.
Telogen Effluvium vs Androgenetic Alopecia
Telogen effluvium is a type of hair loss that occurs when the normal hair growth cycle is disrupted. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including physical or emotional stress, hormonal changes, medications, or nutritional deficiencies. In telogen effluvium, the hair follicles prematurely enter the resting (telogen) phase of the growth cycle, causing hair to shed more than usual. Telogen effluvium typically causes diffuse hair loss, meaning hair falls out evenly from all over the scalp, and the hair loss is often temporary and reversible once the underlying cause is treated. Telogen Effluvium (TE) and Androgenetic Alopecia (AGA) are two distinct hair loss conditions with their causes and characteristics.
Telogen Effluvium (TE)
:
Cause
: TE occurs when the body experiences a significant shock, causing a large number of hair follicles to enter the resting (telogen) phase of the hair growth cycle prematurely. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including illness, surgery, hormonal changes (such as childbirth or thyroid disorders), extreme stress, medications, or nutritional deficiencies.
Characteristics
: TE is distinguished by sudden, diffuse hair shedding across the scalp. It typically appears 2-3 months after the triggering event and usually resolves on its own once the underlying cause is addressed. The hair loss is only temporary, and most people will see regrowth within 6-12 months.
Androgenetic Alopecia (AGA)
:
Cause
: AGA, also known as male or female pattern baldness, is primarily genetic and hormonal. It is the leading cause of hair loss among both men and women. AGA causes hair follicles to become sensitive to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a testosterone-derived hormone, resulting in follicle miniaturisation and gradual hair thinning.
Characteristics
: AGA typically results in a distinct pattern of hair loss. Men's hair loss typically begins with a receding hairline and crown thinning, progressing to partial or complete baldness. In women, it typically causes diffuse thinning across the crown while preserving the hairline. AGA is a chronic, progressive condition that worsens with time if not treated.
Androgenetic alopecia
, also known as male or female pattern baldness, is a genetic condition that affects both men and women. In this condition, hair follicles gradually shrink and produce shorter, finer hairs, eventually leading to hair thinning and hair loss. Androgenetic alopecia typically causes hair loss in a pattern, with thinning occurring in specific areas of the scalp, such as the crown or hairline. In men, androgenetic alopecia typically results in a receding hairline and baldness at the crown, while in women, it often leads to diffuse thinning throughout the scalp. Androgenetic alopecia is generally a progressive condition, meaning it worsens over time and may be more difficult to reverse than telogen effluvium.
In summary, telogen effluvium is temporary hair loss caused by disruptions in the hair growth cycle, while androgenetic alopecia is a genetic condition that causes progressive hair thinning and baldness in specific patterns on the scalp.
Treatment for Telogen Effluvium
Telogen effluvium is a temporary form of hair loss that occurs due to stress, hormonal changes, medication, illness, or nutritional deficiencies. In most cases, the hair grows back without treatment once the underlying cause is addressed. However, some treatments can help speed up the recovery process and promote hair growth. These include:
Addressing the underlying cause
: This may involve making changes to your diet, addressing any nutrient deficiencies, managing stress levels, or adjusting medications.
Minoxidil
: This medication is applied topically to the scalp and can help promote hair growth. It is available over-the-counter and in prescription strengths.
Hair supplements
: Supplements containing biotin, zinc, iron, and other nutrients that
support hair growth
may be beneficial.
Low-level laser therapy
: This treatment involves exposing the scalp to low-level laser light to stimulate hair growth.
Corticosteroids
: In severe cases of telogen effluvium, corticosteroids may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and promote hair growth.
It's important to speak with a healthcare provider or a dermatologist to determine the best course of treatment for your specific case of telogen effluvium.
Symptoms of Telogen Effluvium
Telogen effluvium is a type of hair loss that occurs due to stress or shock to the body, such as childbirth, surgery, severe illness, or emotional stress. The main symptom of telogen effluvium is a significant increase in hair shedding or hair fall. Here are some common symptoms of telogen effluvium:
Increased hair shedding
: More hair than usual falls out when brushing, washing or styling the hair.
Thinning hair
: Hair may appear thinner, especially at the crown of the head.
Widening of the part line
: The part line may appear wider due to hair loss.
Visible hair loss
: Some hair loss may be visible on the scalp, especially when the hair is wet or pulled back.
Slower hair growth
: Hair may grow more slowly than usual.
Changes in hair texture
: Hair may become dry, brittle, or dull.
It is important to note that telogen effluvium is a temporary condition, and the hair usually grows back within six to twelve months after the trigger has been removed. However, in some cases, telogen effluvium can become chronic and may require medical treatment. If you are experiencing hair loss, it is recommended to
consult a healthcare provider
or dermatologist for proper diagnosis and treatment.
Telogen Effluvium: Men
Telogen effluvium is a type of
hair loss
that occurs when a large number of hair follicles on the scalp enter the resting phase of the hair growth cycle (known as the telogen phase) and subsequently shed their hair. This type of hair loss is usually temporary and can be caused by a variety of factors, including stress, illness, hormonal changes, medications, and nutritional deficiencies.
In men, telogen effluvium can occur at any age, but it is most commonly seen in individuals between the ages of 20 and 50. Some common causes of telogen effluvium in men include:
Physical or emotional stress
: Stress can cause a hormonal imbalance in the body, which can disrupt the hair growth cycle and lead to telogen effluvium.
Illness or surgery
: Severe illness or surgery can cause the body to divert nutrients away from the hair follicles, leading to hair loss.
Hormonal changes
: Changes in hormone levels, such as those that occur during
puberty
or as a result of a thyroid disorder, can trigger telogen effluvium.
Medications
: Certain medications, such as those used to treat cancer or high blood pressure, can cause telogen effluvium as a side effect.
Nutritional deficiencies
: A lack of essential nutrients, such as iron or vitamin D, can lead to hair loss.
If you are experiencing hair loss, it is important to
speak with a healthcare professional
to determine the underlying cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan. In most cases, telogen effluvium will resolve on its own once the underlying cause is addressed.
Telogen Effluvium: Women
Telogen effluvium is a form of
hair loss
that occurs when a large number of hair follicles enter the resting (telogen) phase of the hair growth cycle at the same time, leading to increased shedding of hair. Telogen effluvium can be caused by a variety of factors, including hormonal changes, stress, nutritional deficiencies, medications, and medical conditions.
Telogen effluvium can affect both men and women, but it is more common in women. Women may be more susceptible to telogen effluvium due to hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause. In addition, women may also experience telogen effluvium as a side effect of birth control pills or other hormonal treatments. Telogen Effluvium (TE) in women shares many similarities with TE in men, but there are some differences, particularly in terms of triggers and hair loss patterns:
Triggers
: Women can experience TE for a variety of reasons, including:
Hormonal changes include childbirth, menopause, and starting or stopping birth control pills.
Stress refers to physical or emotional stressors such as illness, surgery, or significant life events.
Nutritional deficiencies occur when essential nutrients, such as iron, protein, or certain vitamins and minerals, are not consumed in sufficient quantities.
Certain medications, such as antidepressants, beta blockers, retinoids, and anticoagulants, can cause TE as a side effect.
Thyroid disorders, such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, can cause TE due to hormonal disruptions.
Characteristics
: In women, TE typically manifests as diffuse hair loss across the scalp. It may be more visible when washing or brushing your hair, and affected people may notice an increase in hair in the shower drain or on their hairbrush. Like in men, the shedding phase usually occurs 2-3 months after the triggering event.
Duration
: The duration of TE varies according to the underlying cause and how quickly it is treated. In many cases, hair loss is only temporary, and most women will experience regrowth within 6-12 months after the triggering factor has been addressed.
Management
: Treatment for TE in women entails addressing the underlying cause whenever possible. Hormone therapy, nutritional supplementation, stress management techniques, and medication adjustments are all possible options. In some cases, topical minoxidil (Rogaine) may be prescribed to stimulate
hair regrowth
.
Symptoms of telogen effluvium in women may include increased hair shedding, thinning of the hair, and a reduction in hair volume. However, unlike other forms of hair loss such as androgenetic alopecia (female pattern hair loss), telogen effluvium does not usually cause
bald patches
or permanent hair loss.
Treatment for telogen effluvium typically involves identifying and addressing the underlying cause of hair loss. For example, if telogen effluvium is caused by a nutritional deficiency, supplementation with vitamins and minerals may be recommended. If stress is the trigger, stress reduction techniques may be helpful. In some cases, medication or topical treatments may be recommended to help
promote hair growth
.
Home Remedies for Telogen Effluvium
Telogen effluvium is a common condition in which there is temporary hair loss due to stress, hormonal changes, certain medications, or other factors. While there is no specific cure for telogen effluvium, there are some home remedies that may help manage the condition:
Reduce stress
: Stress is a major factor that can trigger telogen effluvium. So, it's important to manage your stress levels by practicing relaxation techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga.
Maintain a healthy diet
: Eating a well-balanced diet rich in protein, iron, and vitamins can help promote hair growth and prevent hair loss.
Massage your scalp
: Gently massaging your scalp with essential oils such as lavender,
rosemary
, or peppermint oil can help improve blood circulation to the hair follicles and promote hair growth.
Avoid harsh hair treatments
: Avoid using harsh hair treatments such as chemical relaxers, hot oil treatments, or hair dyes, as they can damage your hair and exacerbate hair loss.
Use mild shampoos and conditioners
: Use gentle shampoos and conditioners that do not contain harsh chemicals or sulfates, as they can irritate your scalp and cause further hair loss.
Home Remedies for Telogen Effluvium
: Wash your hair regularly with lukewarm water and avoid using hot water, as it can damage your hair and scalp.
Get enough sleep
: Getting enough sleep is essential for your overall health and well-being, and it can also help reduce stress and promote hair growth.
If your telogen effluvium is severe or persists for a long time, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.
Nutritional Supplements and Diet
Nutritional supplements and a well-balanced diet are essential for overall health and can help keep skin, hair, and nails in good condition. Here's a summary of some key nutrients and dietary considerations:
Vitamins
:
Vitamin A is essential for skin health and cell growth.
Sweet potatoes, carrots, spinach, and liver all contain it, which helps to maintain skin integrity.
Vitamin C is essential for collagen production, which keeps the skin firm and youthful. Citrus fruits, bell peppers, strawberries, and broccoli are all excellent sources.
Vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects skin from free radical damage. Nuts, seeds, and leafy greens are high in vitamin E.
Vitamin D improves immune function and may help reduce skin inflammation. Sunshine is a natural source, but it is also found in fatty fish, fortified dairy products, and nutritional supplements.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
: Found in fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines, as well as flaxseeds, chia seeds, and nuts. Omega-3s help keep skin hydrated and may reduce inflammation, which can help with conditions like acne and eczema.
Zinc
: It promotes skin health, wound healing, and immune function. Meat, shellfish, legumes, nuts, and seeds are all good nutritional sources.
Protein
: Essential for collagen production and tissue repair. Incorporate lean protein sources such as chicken, fish, tofu, beans, and lentils into your diet.
Antioxidants
: Protect the skin from oxidative stress and damage. Aside from vitamins C and E,
antioxidants
can be found in various fruits and vegetables, green tea, and dark chocolate.
Water
: Staying hydrated is essential for maintaining skin elasticity and avoiding dryness. Try to drink plenty of water throughout the day.
Limit Sugar and Processed Foods
: High-sugar and processed-food diets can cause inflammation and aggravate acne. Instead, opt for whole, nutrient-dense foods.
Collagen Supplements
:
Collagen
is a protein that helps the skin retain structure. While more research is needed, some studies indicate that collagen supplements can improve skin elasticity and hydration.
Probiotics
: Gut health is linked to skin health, so consuming probiotic-rich foods like yogurt, kefir, and fermented vegetables may benefit the skin.
It is important to remember that, while supplements can help supplement a healthy diet, they should not be used in place of whole foods. Furthermore, it is always advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before beginning any new supplement regimen, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.
Natural Topical Treatments
Natural topical treatments can be a gentle and effective solution to a variety of skin and hair issues. Here are some common examples:
Aloe Vera
: Known for its calming qualities, aloe vera gel is effective in relieving sunburns, minor burns, and irritated skin. In addition, it can help heal wounds and is hydrating.
Coconut oil
: This multipurpose oil is hydrating and good for dry hair and skin. Additionally, it possesses antimicrobial qualities that could aid in the treatment of
eczema
and
acne
.
Tea Tree Oil
: Known for its antibacterial and antifungal qualities,
tea tree oil
is frequently used to treat fungal infections such as athlete's foot, acne, and dandruff.
Honey
: Raw honey has antibacterial properties and can be used as a spot treatment for acne or to soothe minor cuts and burns.It can be used to make homemade face masks and is also moisturising.
Oatmeal
: Ground oatmeal can be used in baths or as a paste to soothe irritated skin, including eczema and sunburns.Its anti-inflammatory qualities may aid in lessening redness and itching.
Apple cider vinegar
: Toner made of diluted apple cider vinegar can be used to treat acne and restore the pH balance of the skin. It's important to dilute it properly to avoid irritation.
Witch Hazel
: A natural astringent that can help minimise inflammation and tighten pores is
witch hazel
. It is frequently used as a toner for skin that is oily or prone to acne.
Jojoba Oil
: Jojoba oil is a great moisturiser for both skin and hair because it closely mimics the skin's natural sebum. It will not clog pores because it is non-comedogenic.
Shea Butter
: Rich in hydration, shea butter relieves dry, irritated skin. It is frequently found in lip balms and body butters.
Essential Oils
: Therapeutic oils such as lavender, chamomile, and peppermint can be combined with carrier oils or skincare products to provide additional benefits. However, they must be properly diluted and tested on a patch, as they are potent and may cause skin irritation in some people.
Always perform a patch test before trying any new natural remedy, especially if you have sensitive skin or allergies. Consult a healthcare professional if you have persistent or severe skin conditions.
Takeaway: Navigating Life with Telogen Effluvium
Telogen effluvium is a type of hair loss that occurs when more hairs than usual enter the resting (telogen) phase of the hair growth cycle, leading to excessive shedding. While this type of hair loss is often temporary and resolves on its own, there are steps you can take to promote hair regrowth and prevent future hair loss.
Identify and address the underlying cause
: Telogen effluvium can be triggered by a variety of factors, including stress, hormonal changes, nutritional deficiencies, and medication side effects. Identifying and addressing the underlying cause of your hair loss is the first step in preventing further shedding and promoting regrowth.
Maintain a healthy diet
: Eating a well-balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals can help support healthy hair growth. Focus on consuming foods high in protein, iron, zinc, and vitamin D.
Reduce stress
: Stress can be a major trigger for telogen effluvium. Implementing stress-reducing techniques such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises can help promote healthy hair growth.
Use gentle hair care products
: Harsh chemicals and heat styling tools can damage the hair and contribute to hair loss. Opt for gentle hair care products and avoid excessive heat styling.
Consider hair growth supplements
: Certain supplements such as biotin, collagen, and omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to support healthy hair growth. However, it's important to speak with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplements.
Seek professional treatment
: If your hair loss persists or is severe, consider seeking professional treatment from a dermatologist or hair loss specialist. They may recommend topical medications or other treatments to promote hair regrowth.
By following these steps, you can help prevent telogen effluvium-related hair loss and promote healthy hair regrowth.
