<p><span>Alopecia (hair loss) can affect your scalp or your body, and it can be transient or permanent. It can be caused by genes, hormonal imbalances, medical disorders, or just the natural aging process. Anyone can lose head hair, but men are more likely to do so. <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/bald-patches">Baldness</a> is commonly defined as significant <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/hair-fall-hair-loss">hair loss</a> from the scalp. The most prevalent cause of baldness is hereditary hair loss which occurs with age. Some people prefer to let their hair loss go untreated and unhidden. Others may conceal it with haircuts, makeup, hats, or scarves. Others pick one of the available treatments to prevent additional hair loss or to restore growth.</span></p>
<h3><b>Common Causes of Hair Fall in Men</b></h3>
<div><img alt="Common Causes of Hair Fall in Men" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0532/0998/9283/files/Common_Causes_of_Hair_Fall_in_Men_480x480.jpg?v=1725446177"/></div>
<p><span>Male pattern baldness is linked to your genetics and male sex hormones. It usually starts with a receding hairline and then progresses to crown thinning. A follicle is a tiny hole (cavity) in the skin where each strand of hair resides. Baldness develops when the hair follicle shrinks over time, resulting in shorter, finer hair. Finally, the follicle stops producing new hair. The follicles are still alive, indicating that new hair can grow.</span></p>
<h3><b>Recognizing the Early Signs of Hair Loss</b></h3>

<p><span>The symptoms of baldness can vary from individual to person. Some people lose hair around their temples, while others may notice a change in their hairline. Common signs of hair loss are hairline retraction, thinning, widening parts, hair coming out in clumps, and losing hair on your entire body.</span></p>
<h3><b>Medical Treatments for Hair Fall</b></h3>

<p><span>Hair weaving, hairpieces, or a change in hairdo can help to mask hair loss. This is typically the least expensive and safest treatment for male baldness.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Minoxidil: Usage and Effectiveness</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span><a href="https://www.clinikally.com/collections/scalp-solution">Minoxidil</a> (Rogaine) is a topical solution applied to the scalp to increase hair follicles. Many men find it reduces hair loss and helps them grow new hair.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Finasteride: How It Works and Potential Side Effects</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Finasteride (Propecia, Proscar) blocks the growth of the overly active type of testosterone associated with baldness and reduces hair loss. It performs slightly better than minoxidil. When you stop using this medication, your hair will begin to fall out again.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Prescription Medications: What You Need to Know</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Prescription drugs such as finasteride, dutasteride, and oral minoxidil are effective men's hair loss treatments. Every medicine has benefits,  side effects, and considerations.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span>Low-level laser Therapy (LLLT) is a potential therapy for men who are losing hair. It is non-invasive, painless, and effective.

A consultation with a healthcare practitioner or <a href="https://www.clinikally.com/products/video-consult-with-a-skin-hair-specialist">dermatologist</a> can help establish whether LLLT is a good option for your hair loss condition and how to include it in your treatment plan.</span></p>
