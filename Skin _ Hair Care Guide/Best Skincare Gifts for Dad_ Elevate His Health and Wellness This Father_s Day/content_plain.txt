Understanding the Importance of Men's Skincare
When it comes to skin, everyone deserves some pampering and care. Irrespective, if you are a man or a woman, indulging in skincare can be enjoyed by everyone.
Due to increased androgen production in men, their skin tends to be more oily. Also due to any fluctuation in testosterone levels, sebum production is increased, leading to clogging of follicles and bacterial growth. These factors together contribute to an increase in inflammation and acne breakout. Acne, though common on the face, is not limited to it, and occurs also on other body parts like the back and chest.
Increased oil secretion can also act as a breeding ground of a fungus called Malassezia, causing flaky and dry skin to develop near the eyebrows and beard. This leads to intense itch and redness.
Also, altered hormonal fluctuations can cause immense dryness on the skin, leading to flaky skin and a damaged skin barrier.
These problems need to be addressed. While consulting a
dermatologist
is the best thing to do, one can also indulge in skincare at home.This makes skincare for men equally essential and important, just like that of women. Continue reading to find the best, dermatologist recommended products for men!
Daily Skincare Routine for Men
To start with, incorporating skin care into your daily routine is essential. Daily Skincare routine can be followed both at day and night time. The morning skincare ritual that can be followed is:
Cleansing:
Starting the day with washing the face not only refreshes you but also removes the oil produced by the skin during night. Use a gentle, refreshing facial
cleanser
to wash your face.
Toning:
After cleansing, it is recommended to incorporate a toner, as it not only removes the leftover oil but also hydrates the skin as the skin tends to become dry after thorough cleanser. In addition, it also leads to diminished appearance of the pores for a smoother appearance. Toning the face after cleansing restores the natural pH of the skin.
Moisturising:
Contrary to the usual belief that an oily skin does not require a
moisturiser
, in reality, it is of utmost necessity that a moisturiser is applied on to the skin. It is so because, if the skin is not moisturised, the skin produces more oil leading to acne. Hence, it is recommended to incorporate non-comedogenic moisturiser into your skincare ritual to make the skin well hydrated and moisturised.
Protecting:
No matter how flawless the skin looks right now, always apply
sunscreen
before stepping out in the sun. As we age, melasma and skin
pigmentation
that occurs due to UV damage becomes prominent. Hence, using a sunscreen of at least SPF 30 is extremely crucial for the skin wellness in the long run. Indulge in a waterproof and sweat resistant sunscreen to ensure optimal protection. Also, don’t forget to re-apply it after every 2 hours.
Lip Care:
Last, but not the least, indulge in nourishing and hydrating lip care. Use a SPF based lip balm that not only hydrates but also protects the lips from harmful effects of UV rays.
At night time, indulging in a few additional steps can make the skin care game top notch.  Certain steps that can be added in night care skin regimen are:
Double Cleansing:
It implies cleaning the face using 2 cleansers. Step one is usually using an oil based cleanser, followed with a water-based one as Step two. This ensures effective removal of sebum, sunscreen, pollution and other oil based impurities. This not only cleanses the skin, but also revitalises the skin and ensures effective penetration of other skincare products for optimal results.
Exfoliating:
U
sing certain exfoliants like Salicylic Acid or Glycolic Acid, twice or thrice daily, ensures optimal cell turnover. This makes the skin visibly brighter and radiant, as it ensures proper removal of dead skin cells and debris.
Correcting:
Recognise your main skin concern and use a serum specifically targeted to that concern. Remember, to pat and not rub it into the skin. For example, using a
niacinamide
serum like
Clinikally The Ultimate NIA (10% Niacinamide) Serum
to target scars and pigmentation, or a
Retinol
serum like
EVE LOM Radiance Repair Retinol Serum
during the night to prevent wrinkles and fine lines can be incorporated into the night time skin regimen. Always remember to follow the guidelines on the packaging for best results.
Treating Under Eye:
Incorporating an effective under
eye cream
like
Clinikally UltraHeal Under Eye Cream
and
Epique Intensive Revitalising Eye Formula
into the night time routine is also very beneficial as it minimises the swelling and fine lines that occur under the eye area.
Using a Mask:
Incorporating a night time revival mask for skin offers a plethora of benefits as it provides ample hydration. It also works better because, at night time, during deep sleep, the skin heals maximally. This results in improved results.
Peltos Niacinamide Sleep Mask
is highly recommended for attaining a radiant glow.
Addressing Common Skin Concerns for Men
Men's skin faces unique challenges, from breakouts to wrinkles. Addressing these concerns isn't just about vanity – it's about overall well-being.  Taking care of your skin can boost confidence, prevent future problems, and even improve your professional image. So ditch the discomfort and invest in healthy, self-assured skin.
Selecting the Right Products for Various Skin Types
The old saying, “One size doesn’t fit all” is true and implies on skincare as well. The skin type and skin concerns largely dictate the type of skincare products that need to be incorporated. For product selection, understanding and determining your skin type is the first step. There are five main skin types: normal, dry, oily, combination, and sensitive and each type has its own unique characteristics and needs specific care to look its best.
Keep on reading to find more information about the same.
Normal skin:
It's balanced skin type, not too oily or dry, and has a healthy-looking glow. It also has an even skin tone and texture, and pores are usually not very noticeable.
People with a normal skin type can use a plethora of products without much problem. Dermatologist recommended products for normal skin are:
Fash Foam Face Wash
Sunstop Silk Sunscreen Matt Finish SPF 58+
Clinikally SunProtect Sunscreen SPF 50/PA+++
NMFe Daily Moisturising Lotion For Normal to Sensitive Skin
Clinikally The Ultimate NIA (10% Niacinamide) Serum
COSRX The Niacinamide 15 Serum
SOME BY MI AHA-BHA-PHA 30 Days Miracle Serum
Ahaglow S Foaming Face Wash
Dry skin:
It lacks moisture. This makes the skin feel tight, flaky, and rough. Sometimes, it can also result in the skin being  itchy and irritated, especially in cold, dry weather. Also, dry skin is more prone to wrinkles and fine lines.
People with such skin types should use hydrating and deeply nourishing products. Also certain active ingredients that exhibit anti-ageing properties can also be incorporated into the regimen.
Clinikally HydraSoothe Moisturiser
CeraVe Moisturising Lotion for Dry Skin to Very Dry Skin
Revanox Anti-Aging Serum
Clinikally Hyaluronic SkinBooster Serum
Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser

Oily skin:
It produces excess sebum. It is an oily substance that helps keep skin hydrated. Oily skin has a shiny appearance along with enlarged pores. People with oily skin are more prone to breakouts, such as pimples and blackheads. In severe cases stubborn acne can also develop.
People with such a skin type are recommended to incorporate non-comedogenic and sebum regulating products into their skincare routine. Certain dermatologist approved and recommended products are:
Actame Men Face Wash
Adonis DS Acne Face Wash
IPCA Acne-OC Sebum Regulating Moisturizer
Acrofy Acne Lotion for Sebum Control
IPCA Acne-UV Gel Sunscreen SPF 50/PA+++
La Shield Sunscreen Gel
Novology Acne Reduction Serum
Skinmedis Acnelex Pore Refiner
Combination skin:
It is a mix of oily and dry skin. Usually, the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) is typically oily and shiny, while the cheeks and outer areas of the face are dry or normal.
Such people should use a mix of different products and opt for spot treatment based products. People with combination skin can also include various products into their regimen that are hydrating, yet control sebum and maintain optimal skin pH at the same time. Various dermatologist recommended products are:
La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++
Venusia Sun Aqua Water Based Sunscreen SPF 65+ PA++++
Cetaphil Moisturising Lotion (Normal to Combination, Sensitive Skin)
ISDIN Flavo-C Serum
CeraVe Foaming Cleanser for Normal to Oily Skin
Sensitive skin:
It is characterised by skin that quickly and commonly reacts with various products, resulting in redness, flaking, swelling, burning and itching. It is also easily irritated by various environmental factors such as sun exposure, wind, and cold weather.
People with such a skin type should choose their products with utmost caution. Incorporating skincare products that are infused with soothing ingredients like aloe vera, green tea and centella asiatica is recommended.
Consult a dermatologist
for proper guidance. Certain dermatologist recommended products for sensitive skin are:
Gunam Balance Face Cream
Cetaphil Soothing Foam Wash
LISEN Soothing Shade Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA+++

Essential Cleansers for Men
Cleansing is just as important for men's skin as it is for anyone else's, but there are some specific reasons why it's particularly beneficial for men:
Men tend to have thicker skin with larger pores that produce more sebum (oil). Regular cleansing removes excess oil, reducing shine and preventing clogged pores that can lead to breakouts.
Shaving can irritate the skin and lead to ingrown hairs and razor bumps. Cleansing helps prevent these by removing dead skin cells and keeping pores clear.
Cleansing removes dirt and pollutants that can contribute to wrinkles and fine lines. It also allows for better absorption of moisturisers which help keep skin hydrated and plump.
Men's skin benefits from the general cleansing benefits - removing impurities, promoting circulation, and prepping the skin for other products.
Cleansing removes sweat, dirt, and grime leaving skin feeling refreshed and invigorated, especially after a workout or a long day.
Here are some additional things to keep in mind for men's cleansing:
Choose the right cleanser:
Men's skin tends to be oilier, so look for a gentle cleanser formulated for your skin type (oily, normal, etc.). Harsh cleansers can strip the skin of natural oils, leading to dryness and irritation.
Don't skip cleansing after shaving:
Shaving can irritate the skin, so cleansing afterwards with a gentle product helps soothe and prevent irritation.
Cleanse twice a day:
Morning and night is ideal, but if that's not possible, at least cleanse before bed to remove sweat, dirt, and oil accumulated throughout the day.
By incorporating a regular cleansing routine, men can enjoy healthier, clearer, and more comfortable skin. Certain cleansers essential for men according to specific concerns are:
1. Dryness
Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser (Dry to Normal, Sensitive Skin)
Sebamed Olive Face & Body Wash
2. Acne
Saslic DS Foaming Face Wash
Aziclear Anti Acne Facial Cleanser
3. Tanning
Ethiglo Face Wash
CleanseMe Golden Dew Foaming Facewash
4. Dull Skin
Tricept Glutabery Face Wash
Azelia I-Glo Face Wash
5. Fine Lines
Faher Skin Radiance & Age Defying Creamy Face Wash
Revanox Anti-Aging Face Wash
6. Damaged Barrier
Physiogel Hypoallergenic Daily Moisture Therapy Dermo-Cleanser For Dry & Sensitive Skin
iS Clinical Cream Cleanser
7. Dark Spots
Melalumin Depigmenting Face Wash
Yuderma Melarid Triple Action Face Wash
Hydrating Moisturizers to Nourish Skin
Contrary to popular belief, moisturising is just as important for men's skin as it is for women's. Here's why men should moisturise daily:
Men's skin, though it is thicker, is equally prone to dryness. Shaving, weather exposure, and even hot showers can strip away moisture, making the skin tight and uncomfortable. Moisturizing replenishes lost moisture, keeping skin feeling soft and supple.
A healthy, moisturised skin barrier acts as a defence system against environmental aggressors like pollution, sun damage, and harsh soaps. This can help prevent irritation, redness, and discomfort.
Even men want to maintain a youthful appearance. Moisturising helps keep skin hydrated and plump, reducing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.
Soothes After Shave: Shaving irritates the skin. A good moisturiser, especially one formulated for post-shave use, can soothe irritation, razor burn, and ingrown hairs. Look for ingredients like aloe vera or oatmeal for added calming benefits.
Prevents Breakouts: Believe it or not, even oily skin needs moisture.  When skin gets stripped of its natural oils, it can go into overdrive to produce more, leading to breakouts. Moisturising helps regulate oil production and prevent clogged pores that can cause pimples.
Improves Overall Skin Health: Moisturizing isn't just about aesthetics; it's about promoting healthy skin function. Proper hydration allows the skin to function optimally, shedding dead skin cells more effectively and maintaining a healthy glow.
Here are some additional things to keep in mind for men's moisturising:
Choose the right moisturiser:
Look for a lightweight, oil-free formula that absorbs quickly and won't leave a greasy residue. Gels or lotions are often good options for men's skin.
Moisturise daily:
Apply moisturiser after cleansing, both in the morning and at night.
Don't forget the neck and eye area:
The delicate skin around the eyes and neck needs moisture too. Look for a specific product for these areas or use a small amount of your regular moisturiser.
By incorporating a daily moisturising routine, men can experience a variety of benefits for their skin, leaving it feeling healthy, comfortable, and looking its best.
Anti-Aging Products to Combat Fine Lines
Anti-aging products can offer a range of benefits for men's skin, helping to combat the visible signs of ageing and promote a healthier, more youthful appearance. Here's a breakdown of some key benefits:
Reduction in wrinkles and fine lines as various anti-aging products contain ingredients like retinol, peptides, and antioxidants that stimulate collagen production and improve skin elasticity. This can lead to a reduction in the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, giving skin a smoother, firmer look.
Revanox Anti-Aging Serum
and
Aveil Exfol-A Anti Aging Serum
are great recommendations.
With ageing, skin naturally loses moisture, leading to dryness and a dull complexion. Anti-aging products like
Yuderma Skindose Time Filler
often contain
hyaluronic acid
, glycerin, and other hydrating ingredients that help lock in moisture and keep skin plump and supple.
Some anti-aging products like
Neolayr Pro Vitamin-C Face Cream
contain ingredients like
vitamin C
and kojic acid that can help fade age spots and hyperpigmentation caused by sun damage. This can result in a more even skin tone and a brighter complexion.
Many anti-aging products include SPF protection, which is crucial for preventing further sun damage. Sun exposure is a major contributor to wrinkles, age spots, and loss of elasticity. Using an SPF moisturiser like
Episoft AC Moisturiser with Sunscreen SPF 30
daily can help slow down these signs of ageing.
Anti-aging products can promote healthier skin cell turnover, which helps shed dead skin cells and reveal a brighter, more radiant complexion. Additionally, some ingredients can help minimise the appearance of enlarged pores, a common concern for men.
Bioderma Sebium Pore Refiner
effectively penetrates the skin and shrinks the pores.
By incorporating anti-aging products into a regular skincare routine, men can experience a variety of benefits and take proactive steps towards maintaining healthy, younger-looking skin.
Grooming Essentials Every Man Needs
Every man should have a basic grooming kit to maintain a polished and confident appearance. Start with a quality facial cleanser to remove dirt and oil, followed by a moisturiser to keep your skin hydrated and healthy. A shaving kit, including a good razor, shaving cream, and aftershave, is essential for a smooth and irritation-free shave. If you have a beard, beard oil or balm is a must to keep it soft and well-groomed. Hair styling products like pomade, gel, or wax help you achieve and maintain your desired hairstyle. A reliable deodorant is crucial for staying fresh and preventing body odour. Keep a nail clipper set handy for well-maintained nails. Adding a signature cologne can boost your confidence and leave a lasting impression. Don't forget sunscreen to protect your skin from harmful UV rays and lip balm to prevent chapped lips. These grooming essentials ensure you always look and feel your best.
Beard Care for a Polished Look
Beard care is essential for a well-groomed and healthy facial mane. It promotes healthy hair growth, prevents itchiness and irritation, and keeps your beard looking its best. Just like the hair on your head, a beard needs nourishment and maintenance to thrive.
The Importance of Sunscreen for Men
Despite stereotypical portrayals of masculinity, photoprotection is a scientifically sound decision for men. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun disrupts cellular processes, leading to DNA damage and mutations. These mutations are a significant risk factor for the development of skin cancers, which are more prevalent in males. Daily sunscreen application offers a well-established defence mechanism, reducing UV-induced cellular damage and safeguarding against these malignancies. Various benefits offered by sunscreen for men skin are:
Protection from skin cancer
Prevention of sunburn
Maintenance of youthful appearance
Prevention of melasma and skin spots
Sunscreen is a simple step with significant benefits for your health and appearance. So, make it a habit to wear sunscreen every day, rain or shine.
Exfoliation for Healthy Skin
Exfoliation is a key player in maintaining healthy skin as it effectively removes the top layer of dead skin cells, dirt, and oil buildup. This process offers a range of benefits for your skin's health and appearance:
By increased epithelial cell turnover, new skin cells are revealed, resulting in a smoother and more radiant complexion.
Deeper penetration of the products occurs into the skin, which maximises the effectiveness of your moisturiser, serums, and other treatments.
Regular exfoliation removes the dead skin cells and dirt effectively, leading to lesser appearance of pores, whiteheads and blackheads, thus revealing a smoother and more even skin tone.
Gentle exfoliation stimulates blood circulation, thus improving overall skin health, as nutrient and oxygen delivery to the skin surface is enhanced.
Due to proper and effective dead cell removal and unclogging of pores, acne breakouts are prevented with ease.
However, it's important to exfoliate with the right frequency and pressure to avoid irritation. Consider your skin type and choose an exfoliating method that suits your needs. Remember, consistency is key! Regular exfoliation, along with a proper skincare routine, can significantly contribute to healthy, glowing skin.
Boosting Dad's Health: Wellness and Nutrition Supplements
As Dad gets older, supporting his well-being becomes even more important. Consider a two-pronged approach: focusing on a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and exploring targeted nutritional supplements to fill any nutrient gaps. This can help him stay active, feel his best, and age vibrantly.
Choosing the Right Supplements for His Needs
While supplements can be a helpful addition to a healthy lifestyle, it's crucial to choose the right ones. Here's a guide to navigate the world of supplements and make informed decisions:
Assessment of needs and health:
Talking to the doctor that attends your father is a very effective way to enlist the supplements that might be needed as they are not only aware about the entire medical history, but also can check for potential interactions.
Also, understand the lifestyle activeness of your father before incorporating any supplement into the diet.
Research Different Supplements:
Some common options for men include Vitamin D3 for bone health, a multivitamin for general well-being, or protein powder to support muscle building or recovery.
Carbamide Forte Multivitamin With Probiotics Tablet For Men
is very effective.
Look for reputable brands with third-party certifications ensuring quality and ingredient accuracy.
Choose the Right Form and Dosage:
Supplements come in capsules, tablets, gummies, liquids, and even powders. Choose the form that suits Dad's preferences and ease of use.
Don't exceed the recommended dosage. Too much of a good thing can be harmful. Always follow the instructions on the label or as directed by a doctor.
Consistency is Key:
Supplements work best when taken consistently.
Monitor and Re-evaluate:
Track the progress and make sure that no side effects are experienced. In case, any side effects are experienced, it is recommended to consult a doctor immediately.
Essential Vitamins and Minerals for Men
While a balanced diet is the best way to get the vitamins and minerals your body needs, some men may benefit from taking supplements to fill nutrient gaps. Here are some essential vitamins and minerals for men:
Vitamin D:
Crucial for bone health and immune function, men are more likely than women to be deficient. Sunlight helps your body produce vitamin D, but supplementation might also be needed.
Vitamin B Complex:
Important for energy production, cell metabolism, and nervous system function, there are eight B vitamins, each with a specific role. Men may need higher doses of certain B vitamins like B12 and folate.
Vitamin C:
An antioxidant that protects cells from damage, vitamin C also plays a role in immune function and collagen production.
Magnesium:
Involved in many bodily functions like muscle and nerve function, blood sugar control, and blood pressure regulation, men tend to lose magnesium as they age and may need supplementation.
Zinc:
Important for immune function, wound healing, and testosterone production, zinc deficiency can lead to low testosterone levels, fatigue, and impaired wound healing in men.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids:
Essential for heart health, brain function, and inflammation, men who don't eat much fish may benefit from omega-3 supplements.
Calcium:
Essential for strong bones and teeth, men need just as much calcium as women, but are more likely to be deficient.
Selenium:
An antioxidant that protects cells from damage and plays a role in thyroid function and reproduction.
If you're concerned about your nutrient intake, talk to your doctor before taking any supplement. They can assess your individual needs and recommend the most appropriate course of action.
Benefits of Natural and Organic Supplements
While natural and organic supplements boast potential benefits like higher nutrient content and freedom from synthetic ingredients, remember they aren't a magic bullet.  A balanced diet is key, but these supplements might offer an edge by containing more readily absorbed nutrients and fewer chemicals, potentially promoting overall well-being.
Final Thoughts on Skincare Gifts for Father's Day
In conclusion, Father's Day is a chance to celebrate the special men in our lives.  While a traditional tie or grilling tools might be appreciated, a well-chosen skincare gift set shows you care about his well-being and want him to look and feel his best.  By considering his skin type and specific needs, you can give him a gift that promotes healthy skin, boosts his confidence, and creates a pampering ritual he can enjoy every day. So ditch the generic and embrace the gift of self-care – Dad deserves it!
