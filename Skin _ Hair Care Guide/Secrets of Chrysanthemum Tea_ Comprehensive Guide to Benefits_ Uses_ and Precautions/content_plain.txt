The Antioxidant Powerhouse: Exploring Chrysanthemum's Healthful Compounds
Chrysanthemum contains a variety of compounds that contribute to its antioxidant properties, making it a potential powerhouse in the promotion of health and wellness. Here are some of the beneficial compounds found in the chrysanthemum:
Chrysanthemum is high in flavonoids, a type of plant compound that has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.  Flavonoids like quercetin, luteolin, and apigenin are abundant in chrysanthemum and help neutralize harmful free radicals in the body, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.
The carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, which are beneficial to
eye health
, are present in significant amounts in chrysanthemum. Lutein and zeaxanthin accumulate in the retina and help protect against age-related macular degeneration and other eye disorders by filtering harmful blue light and reducing oxidative stress.
Chlorogenic acid is a phenolic compound found in chrysanthemum that has antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties.  It helps scavenge free radicals, reduces inflammation, and may aid in the prevention of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes.
Chrysanthemum contains mogrosides, which are the natural compounds responsible for its sweetness. Unlike sugar, mogrosides contain no calories or carbohydrates and have been investigated for potential health benefits such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic properties.
Chrysanthemum essential oils are high in terpenes, sesquiterpenes, and esters, which contribute to its fragrant flavour and aroma. Some of these volatile compounds have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, which contribute to the overall health benefits of chrysanthemum.
While chrysanthemum is not a high-quality source of vitamins and minerals, it does contain trace amounts of nutrients such as vitamin A,
vitamin C
, potassium, and calcium, all of which contribute to overall health and wellness.

Cover While Steeping
: To ensure a fragrant and flavorful infusion, cover the teapot or cup while steeping to maintain heat and keep the aromatic oils from escaping.
Strain and Serve
: After the tea has finished steeping, use a tea infuser or a fine-mesh strainer to remove the chrysanthemum flowers.  Depending on your preference, pour the tea into cups and serve hot or over ice.
Sweeten to Taste
: You can drink chrysanthemum tea unsweetened or with a little honey, sugar, or fruit juice added for extra sweetness.  To taste, adjust the sweetness and savour!
Reuse Chrysanthemum Flowers
